"[My 1^st post here, so please be gentle]

Prompted by a number of comment responses in /r/AskWomen...

I hold an MD from Stanford and worked as a cancer researcher at a biotech firm in San Carlos, California. My husband has his doctorate from Stanford in statistics and worked at Google through the 2004 IPO and stayed until his lock-out period was over.

In 2016, we were married. The trigger for marriage was the Trump election, specifically immigration and healthcare. My husband's Dutch, of Moroccan background and I'm a breast cancer survivor. His sister was in over her head regarding raising a child while her partner and she worked long hours, so he offered to raise the child, from a year old, and we legally adopted her.

After marriage, we settled in Barcelona, where husband has owned a 2-bedroom, 1 bathroom condominium, since 2006. The unemployment rate nationally is [16.8% and regionally it's 12.19%](https://tradingeconomics.com/spain/unemployment-rate), so he figured he'd relax and spend time with (what we've accepted to be) our child. My intent was to relax in any case. So, we're both not working."
"Hello all, been a while since my last sticky post on here. First of all, BIG thank you to u/storiesofcovid for the wonderful website for covid diaries! I'm sure it'll serve to illuminate the strength in all of us during these trying times. I wholeheartedly support the site you made. Speaking of, I'd like to take this time to encourage you all to support one another and do what you can to help others. There are numerous charities that you can donate to, and your local food banks and homeless shelters could really use some help too. Life is gonna be really difficult for ALL of us for a while, so we have to look out for each other. I believe that our community can do some incredible good in these scary and stressful times. And to any of you who work in the grocery, utility, healthcare, shipping, and other essential industries, I'd like to thank you. THANK YOU for doing your part in all of this. Without you, things would be a lot worse.

Much love, Anna. ❤️

P.S: Y'all possibly won't see me again for a while. I am strugglin with mental health, so I will be vanishing into hospital inpatient care for a bit. See ya on the other side, stay strong y'all. You got this."
"I can't pin-point the day I knew I didn't want to be a nurse anymore.

For months, I had been desperately trying to jump through hoops to get my financial aide approved. Between having a drug addict father who you can rarely hunt down, and having a strained maternal relationship, it gets hard when FAFSA wants a detailed history of your parents earnings.

I had wanted to be a nurse since I started hospital work nearly four years ago. The women in the first ICU I ever worked at were phenomenal. They were smart, and kind-hearted, and could probably kick your ass. I had never known female role models so fierce, and I wanted to be just like them. I stood readily by the bedside and clang to every bit of knowledge they blessed me with. I was taught so much, from warning signs of certain illnesses to what gauge of I.V. you wanted for what type of patients (bigger is not always better, by the way). At around midnight, if time allowed, we'd set around the ""family dinner table"" (which was really the island in the center of the nurses station) and have our lunch. Here we'd discuss politics, make jokes, and share whatever laid heavy on our hearts. In time I learned that you couldn't lean on the back of Courtney's chair because it made her nervous, and when you gave a bath with Evelyn she always wanted shaving cream in the water. We operated like a well oiled machine, and I had never fit in so well with any group of people better in my life. I would work two and three extra shifts a week just to spend time with my ""adopted family"".

When life outside of work became to hard for me, I eventually made the decision to move. With tears in my eyes at the dinner table one night, I told them I had to leave. That I was packing my backs to move 3 hours away to be with my SO, since family complications had become too heavy to bear. I needed an escape. And they understood. Encouraged me to pack my things and run. So I did.

I started work in my new town, but it was never that same without them. I found that without my family, I hated my job. Every vital sign came with an eye roll, every call bell made me want to cry. I hated my patients, I hated my coworkers, I hated my job, and I hated my life. My mental health was taking a toll. I began having suicidal thoughts for the first time in years. Every morning was a fight to get out of bed. I cried both on the way to and the way home from work.

Which brings us to last week. After the hardest day I had ever had to date I was through. After getting home at roughly 8pm, I spent the next six hours applying to jobs. I saw an ad were BWW was having open interviews. I stopped by the next day and within three days I was working. I quit my CNA job with notice, which I know the girls from my first job would not approve of, but if I had to go there one more day I risked having a mental breakdown.

Today was my second day. I've had a great time so far, the chill work environment has done wonders for my mental health already. After work, I came home and did laundry and even spent some time with my family.

I'm not sure where to go from here, but I've got this feeling that I'm gonna be okay."
"My first post. Here is something that I have been feeling and I would like to get off my chest.

You know...I spend my time at work dealing with peoples problems, unruly neighbors, robberies, thefts, domestics, traffic accidents, the death of a loved one, who is now laying face up in the house where he used to get ready everyday. Where the two of you shared memories of laugher or moments before a big event, where you found love and happiness. The home where your kids were born in and took their first steps, now they have kids of their own and all you had left was him. Now he is laying there, lifeless, a statue that resembles a past life. Dead, but still at the state where he could reach out and grab your leg as if was some sort of dark humor joke. The nightmare would cease, a moment of shock and then the realization that your initial thoughts were not as they seemed. However, that is not the case, he continues to lay there. I come in, a young police officer in a uniform, to trample around your apartment in my shiny black boots, to trample on the memories of who he was and what he meant to you. Those things I will never know, nor do I ask. As I am only there to deal with your problems. The things you are unable to deal with. I am the one to call the ME. To start making the arrangements for his passing.

I deal with people at their worst, I see the worst in humanity and what they are capable of doing to each other. Everyday I deal with that. You may go into work and think that you deal with the worst of humanity. I can tell you, until you sit down and look across the table, into the broken eyes of a woman who has just been beaten by the man she calls her husband or the man who emotionally abuses her and has a hold on her fragile heart. In her eyes you can see the embarrassment, the fear, the shame, how she is unsure of what the following days will hold, you see a human being who is emotionally broken...I can promise you, that you have not seen what I have seen. You have not seen how horrible humanity really can be. 

You call me when you need me and berate we when you don’t. You want me to take care of the things that no one wants to see, no one wants to deal with. You want me to be this swift hammer of justice that takes away all crime with one fell swoop. So that you may sleep soundly in your bed at night. Now picture when the tables are turned, and it’s you who I am looking at, on the side of the road, under my bright flashlight on a dark and cold night when all you want to do is go home, but the red and blue lights illuminating your mirrors keep you still, with a pit in your stomach and that sinking feeling of uncertainty on if I will return with only your license or if I will return with a citation. But I’m the bad guy, I should be out “catching real criminals”. I shouldn’t be wasting my time with someone like you...a law abiding citizen. 

I, like everyone in this world. Feel happiness, joy, content. I also feel sadness, anxiety, depression. I feel like I am worthless and that my life means nothing. I feel as though people tolerate me. They are not truly my friend. Only someone who they reach out to in a time of need or a time of boredom. When they have exhausted every last resource available to them. I am that last resort. I feel as though my emotions and feelings don’t mean as much as everyone else’s. That I am a burden on the lives of the people I consider my friends. I am afraid to turn to them and express how sometimes I wish i could end this pain. This empty pit in my stomach, that as soon as it is filled, it is draining and the pit becomes empty again. The feeling of self doubt and worthlessness grow inside of me like a parasite. Slowly trying to take over my mind in an effort to further itself. That parasite is suicide. It tells me lies and tries to deceive me everyday. It tries, and a lot of the times succeeds, in emptying my stomach, so that the pit returns and those dark thoughts come back. 

I feel as though that if one day, I were to slip away and not come back. No one would notice, no one would question my whereabouts. I would not be missed and i would be forgotten. The memories I shared with people would fade away similar to the cover of an old book. Slowly becoming less real, until I am no more. 

I guess in a sentence, I deal with peoples demons, but let me ask you this...who deals with mine? Who is going to be there when I need help? I am the one who is supposed to show up in a time of need, not someone else, not a some other uniform. But I even though I can’t help myself, I don’t want to call the police. Why? Because I am the police. Those are my brothers responding to my call. It may be pride, it may even be shame. But what it really is, is fear. Fear that they will see in my eyes what I saw in that woman as she told me about what her husband did to her. The feeling of being vulnerable and open. 

I run away from being vulnerable and open. Again, you may ask why? Well the simple answer is that it is because of how my day goes. Dealing with peoples problems, unruly neighbors, robberies, thefts, domestics, traffic accidents, the death of a loved one. If I am vulnerable and open, it will be seen by those very criminals that you want me to eradicate. They will take advantage of my vulnerability and use that time to strike. That could mean that my day at the office is going to be my last one. 

Now if I make it home at the end of the my watch. How do you transfer over after an entire day of dealing with peoples problems? I am expected to come home and act like nothing is wrong."
"Hey guys!

I  made a website that allows people to share their diaries during the coronavirus pandemic. The idea is that we are perhaps living an unprecedented situation that may be taught in history books in the  future. I think it would be a  great opportunity for people to share their experience.

The goal would be that if it's successful enough, to print out a few book copies that include these stories, and to send them around the world to various libraries so that in case the website doesn't exist anymore, there's still a copy of these.

I think it  would great for someone in years from now to be able to read these diaries to have a real sense of how it was like to live during such a  pandemic.

Here's the link: [https://storiesofcovid.com/](https://storiesofcovid.com/)

Please do post your coronavirus diaries in this subreddit too! At Stories of Covid, we don't mind you posting these stories elsewhere. In any case,  it's the first time I make a website, so be nice, I know it  doesn't  look amazing yet, but bare with me, new features are coming  soon :)   (Feel free to send me suggestions).

Thank you mods for allowing me to post this :)"
"Ladies and Gentlemen,

If you're reading this... Great! You're here to get to know me better.

&#x200B;

**But who am I?**

Well, in the context of this post I'll stick to ""The\_Gray\_Wolf"" to not reveal too much about my private life. I invite you, however, to continue reading to learn more about somebody else's psychology, in this case, mine.

Unfortunately, it won't be enough to make you understand the extent of this thought process, because if I really presented everything I wanted to tell you about myself, we would be here for days. From what I can tell, this will be me throwing in different ideas that went on in my head while writing this down. It's not edited that well so if you spot any mistakes in here you're allowed to keep them.

&#x200B;

**Now, what can I say about myself on the top of my head?**

I've never had an internet persona until February where I uploaded some videos I've had edited for fun to share with my friends on YouTube. My private social media accounts are set to private and compared to the ones of my friends, they look barren. Other than that, I've never shared or liked anything publicly online and the comment section has always been a taboo for me.

Even when hiding behind a username, I didn't feel comfortable expressing my opinions and thoughts to anyone. I've been the creeper who's always watching but never saying anything and I'm sure a lot of you know what I'm talking about. Over the 18 years of my life, I consumed A LOT of media whether it is a book, video or movie while reading comments, critiques or discussions and listening to what people had to say about it.

&#x200B;

**But why was it that I never shared anything?**

My opinion is by no means the one of an expert so I figured that my voice would just go down in the masses. I felt excited (and I still do) when I was about to share something online. But I never went past the friends-only on Facebook or the videos mentioned before, which was quite clear from the beginning that no one would see them except my friends. A couple of years ago I had a funny comment for a video and I imagined getting thousands of likes, living the dream, you know? But before I worked up the courage to click ""send"" I saw the exact comment posted way before me with one single like.

That definitely made me think about things. There were people out there who thought the same way as me, which meant, I'm not as special as I thought I was at that time.

You see, back in school, I was the bomb:

I had the best grades, was the most athletic, moderately handsome dare I say, and I later found out that a couple of girls had a crush on me. In theory, I had a perfect school life. But I wouldn't be telling you about this if there wasn't a catch.

True, I was every parent's dream, but it was because I was constantly criticizing everything, especially myself. I didn't want to be the best. I knew that I was too good for the others around me. I wanted to be perfect and I wanted for people to know it. And that meant having a very conflicted nature.

On the one hand, I had to show them that I am the best. On the other hand, that meant gloating. And people didn't like a show-off. So I couldn't be perfect in other people's eyes, because I would be a douche bag. And a douche bag isn't the perfect guy I wanted to be.

I was stuck in a hellish cycle of pushing myself to be great but bringing myself back down on earth to not rub it into other peoples faces. The thought process was quite flawed now that I look back on it, but I didn't realize it back then and that was quite destructive for me. I refrained from ever talking about myself in order to not come off as bragging.

In private, I had to fight with sleep deprivation, anxiety, and constant stress. My everyday life was too much to handle, but I was too proud to admit it. I had a reputation to uphold, you know?

Even during my lowest of lows, I kept up a strong face as if it wouldn't bother me at all what was happening in my personal life, which my classmates all knew about anyway because of the very close connection of our parents. What I really wanted was for someone to see the misery I lived in. I wanted someone to come to talk to me because no one ever would. That's why I started this nightmare in the first place. Be the best, so people will like me.

To my horror, I saw the children my age having fun without me even though I had the same interests as them: Video games, movies, football, etc. yet, they never came up to me to invite me to go out or even talk to me during recess. I saw all the other athletes, who were popular. I saw all the other Gamers, who were having a blast. I saw the other classmates, who would meet up to watch a movie at someone's place. They were happy because they were dumb I was telling myself. But that couldn't be the reason why they would never include me. I was doing everything right. I was the best.

I concluded that I was just too mature for my age and thus too smart for them. So I distanced myself and pushed myself even harder to get the straight A's, go to football practice everyday, and educating myself on all kinds of media. If I had to summarize grade 5 through 11 in one word, it would be burnout. And I did all that for the other's attention, even though I hated them. I was in conflict with myself and the most important question I couldn't answer was: ""Why am I not good enough?""

I've always been self-aware and criticizing, but talking about myself in a good way felt wrong. Even today I'm not quite fond of sharing my positive side, but I handle critics way better now (myself included) and I actually prefer hearing what people don't like about me in order to see for myself if that's something I would or would not change about me.

Depression is a word I don't like to use because it has lost it's meaning on the internet, but for the lack of a more fitting word, I was depressed to the point of becoming suicidal. Everything I did all the way to high school was a futile attempt at trying to fit in somewhere. Up to that point, I was telling myself that I'll wait until the others are mature enough to see the world as I do and then they'll see what a great person I am. That didn't happen.

It was then when a tragedy struck in my life that pushed me to the edge, but luckily not quite over it. After months of insomnia, I found myself in a numbed state, not caring about anything or anyone anymore. I spend nights with a knife placed on my throat or on the edge of the balcony while my family was suspecting nothing. I never shed a tear about anything, not even taking my own life. The only thing holding me back was a quote (by 50 Cent of all people): ""Death gotta be easy, cause life is hard"" I figured that taking my life would be the easy way out and since I was the stubborn guy I was, I was too proud to take the easy way. It wasn't the fear of going through with it, it was my will to come out on top cemented in the back of my head. Plus I wanted answers. How come I have to put through all this hell, while inferior people (yes I was referring to my classmates as inferiors which bothered me) get to have a happy life?

It was in Grade 11 when a friend of mine finally asked me what was wrong. We started talking, well actually, I was talking all night while he was sitting across of me listening. I told him about my struggles, my unhealthy views on other people (which included him in some degree), and my lack of emotion over the last months. It felt really great to finally have said everything that had been bothering me up to that point.

He had to think for a couple of minutes. Then he gave me the simplest answer that I with my oh so intelligent brain couldn't come up: I was too good. Sure I was nice and kind and I had shown them that I wasn't stuck up even with my ""superiority"", but just being the way I was I became unreachable. My ambitious nature put everyone else under pressure because I've always been raising the bar for everyone else. They were just too afraid to talk to me. Apparently, some were being compared to me all the time by their parents. Additionally, when I wouldn't come up to talk to them because I was too weak, I came off as a snob, which, if I have not made it clear up to this point, was something I didn't want them to think about me.

Needless to say that after that revelation I made a huge change as a person. Me posting here is enough proof, at least for me. I never wanted to share anything about myself online, because my opinions were well thought out to be put in word, as you might have guessed by the length of this post. (It sounds kind of snobby, but I don't care about that anymore). Normally I would have been overthinking and over analyzing to the point where I ultimately decide not to say anything. Today seems to be different. Maybe there's interest in my person and I'll follow up with more some day.

&#x200B;

**Why am I telling you all this?**

Well dear stranger, today I freely decide to say: ""F\*ck it!"" and post something online. The reason is that I made a new Reddit account I made a couple days ago in order to finally go public with my fantasy novel I've been working on for a year, but that's a topic for another day (and probably another sub).

What I learned in this brief time on Reddit is, that if I want to realize my dream of getting it done and published, I have to write more. Way more. So the best thing I could start with is to write something about myself. Once I, as a person, am out there on the Internet, I can go on to publish my work. In my opinion, that's the best way to separate what people think about me and what they think about my novel. Yes, most of the people won't even have bothered to read up to this point or even know that this post even exists, and will probably build their opinion about me as a person someday, but I'm not doing it for them, I'm doing it for myself.

People often define themselves through what they have achieved. I disagree because that seems rather superficial. You don't know what a person is like, because of a thing they did. It's a dumb and overused example, but a celebrity giving his/her money to charity doesn't automatically make him/her a good person. You should define yourself with your values, thoughts, and beliefs and always ask yourself if what you are doing at any given time corresponds with it. I know it sounds confusing because I just said that actions should be seen separately from the person doing them.

What I try to say is, that you should always question the motive for an action before you judge the character or the person. The more you know about a person the better you can assess if something they did represents them accordingly. If someday I'll be able to finish the novel, consider this the ""About the author"" section.

&#x200B;

**Now back to the question.**

I'm doing this for a couple of reasons:

1. For the ones that need this. Often just hearing about someone else's problems makes it easier to talk about one's own difficulties. And talking is the first and most important step.
2. Write more. As mentioned before I haven't nearly written enough to make a good enough book which might become the next pop culture hit. Or at least that's the dream.
3. Make sneaky promo for my book. Just by mentioning it here I might have sparked the interest of at least one reader. If not... well, too bad.
4. Karma points. In order to create my own Subreddit, I will have to interact with others a little. Talk about effective methods to crack the shells of users.
5. Show the world who I am. The more open I am about myself, the more people will think that I'm a good person. (Being self-aware and meta is what makes you relatable and cool nowadays. And I just realized that this must be at least two levels of meta.)
6. For future reference. I imagine two scenarios. One where someone else will look me up to see where this author started. And the other where I will look back to see what I was like on the 28th of October 2018.

**For the ones still reading:**

Thank you for your time. If you're interested in my person, there is still much to say about me. Alternatively, I got many stories to tell (I mean the ones I actually experienced, not plugging the novel here). Or you can just ask me something in the comments. It's my very first post here, so I'm (slightly) sorry if there's anything about it that bothers you.

"**Please write for me?**  
In 2-5 years (yes, this is the type of weird planning teachers do), I want to use your journals describing your reactions to the coronavirus crisis that we are living through. They will be amazing in History classes. They could also be incredible in the English classroom too.

**Why?**  
We are currently going through what will be taught in History classes in the future. Our current experience will be spoken about for years, just as people still refer to the Spanish Flu of 100 years ago.  
As you go about your days, in self isolation or in other ways, would you write a journal every few days (or every day if you want), or a reflective piece on what's happened so far. It could be what you did, or about what's going on. It can have links to news stories, YouTube videos, memes, even tiktoks if you so feel the need.

**How I think I'll use it-**

**History**\- pretty straight forward, as a primary document. Plus, I am asking people from multiple countries, so it can be a good global snapshot.

**English**\- analysis of language styles, voice & audience, depth of tone and meaning. What is taken as important to the author? The inference skill required by the student will foster their literacy growth and with numerous nationalities writing these (I hope), the English across them will be great for EAL students particularly.

I have started mine, but to have others would be amazing.

Please write and then share them with me please.

"She passed away in ICU April 21 from sepsis, probably from UTI. I was numb for the past month; I knew she was gone, but it was a mixture of trying to stay strong for my family and trying to get to normal everyday life. Then today, I’m in class talking about heart rhythms and I couldn’t help but remember the exact moment I’m with her and watching the monitor fail to pick up a rhythm only minutes after deciding to withdraw care. And now I’m just a wreck. I’m not home with my family and it sucks.

I feel like something was taken from us. My mom wasn’t even 50 yet and should’ve seen me and my brothers grow up and start families of our own. And now we’ll have to do that without her.

I feel guilty because she had been sick for a while and I feel I could’ve spent more time with her or giving her advice or just making her feel better. 

I miss her."
"Yesterday my girlfriend of 14 months broke up with me. We lived together, had a dog, had plans to move cross country this summer. I thought we would get married. We cried yesterday.

Today I cried, alone on my floor. My dog was confused about what was happening. ""I'm just not as happy as I want to be."" I reflected her words all day. I feel that I can't even be upset because I understand her. I get why she did this and I think I might do the same in her shoes. It rant caught me off guard. When she told me, it was blunt but passive. Just after waking up : ""we need to start talking about breaking up."" I cried a lot today.

I'm still trying to figure out what my life looks forward from here. When we were together I saw our home our family and careers. My life with you made sense. Now I can't even picture what my next weeks look like. I can't even picture myself with kids right now, I'm really messed up. I don't know how I'd get by with my pup. He's my little guy, resting his head on me asleep in bed as a write this. "
"I have low self esteem. Which isn't to say that I don't like myself, but that I am my own worst critic. I've always felt like I'm so much slower and duller than those around me- that my interests don't match up with other people my age. I'd rather spend my money on plants and pets then spend it going out and experiencing the world. In fact, I often imagine that If i were trapped in my house for a number of years with nothing but my pets, plants, and the internet for company- I could survive. 

I know that I often hold myself back by the very nature of my firm belief that I am incapable or not good enough at something. I spent most of my life telling myself I would never be able to do a job that required higher-level thinking. I told myself I could never be a scientist or a doctor. That I could never do any job involving mathematics. When people in my life have hurt me, I told myself that it was my own fault for being stupid and naive. 

A little firefly of an idea started it all. A spark in the darkness- I found myself drawn to a career path that I never imagined myself even capable of considering. Becoming an accountant is so completely opposite of the person I have always imagined myself to be, but the fact that I'm willing to try, that I am enjoying the classes... its something to be celebrated. I am trying, ever so slowly, to change my perception of myself. I am the heaviest weight on my own shoulders and I'm missing so much of life because of dread and doubt poisoning every happy moment.

I still have so far to go... but one step at a time will eventually get me there.

"I feel so disconnected. So disconnected from everything. From everyone. I keep feeling like I'm watching a movie. A movie of life itself. Time keeps going in slowmotion. And I don't know what the next scene will be like. I hate that. The not knowing. I prefer the stability. I prefer knowing what life will bring. And now? Life is spinning out of control. Who knows what will happen tomorrow. Who knows. It just all feels so surreal. And I hate it.

I want to sleep. For a few weeks. Disappear from the world. Until this is all over. Until life is back to normal. Until it's stable again. Until I don't feel like screaming at this movie screen. 

Until I no longer hate the world."
"Yesterday, we had a shooting outside the hospital. It lasted shortly, though I don't know all the details yet, and the investigators (police) are still gathering the facts. I got an alert on my phone via text that a ""SHELTER IN PLACE"" was in effect. Basically, this means to stay where you are and use your training to the best of your ability to survive. It works on three principles they've trained us on: run, hide, or fight. Anyway, nothing happened to us, and after about, say, 5 minutes, the all clear was given and we went back to work.

From what I gathered, the cops in the adjacent town tried to pull the shooter over in his car because of a traffic violation, probably speeding or something like that. He takes off in his car, crashes it near the hospital, and then starts shooting at the police. They retaliate, and one of our valet workers gets shot in the head. I still don't know if it was crossfire from the cops and/or the suspect, or if the poor guy was purposely targeted by the suspect. The shooter died on the scene, either from bleeding out from the cops lighting him up or from a self-inflicted wound (i.e. he shot himself in the head). Again, there's so much more to the story that I'm sure the investigators will look into and release. 

The valet worker is in stable condition. Poor guy. He was going to work, only for this to happen to him, and on a Friday, no less. The neighborhood the hospital is in is one of the safest places in the city, and for the obvious reason that these hospitals have high levels of security, including the city's police department presence. For something like this to happen is extremely rare. I hope the guy makes a speedy recovery and isn't disabled anywhere in his body.

Anyway, we're all safe here. So, yeah, not much else to say other than that. More and more of our research is coming along, and I have to make a presentation next week on Wednesday. I have to choose an article pertaining to what our lab is investigating, although it can really be on anything scientific related, as long as it's from a peer-reviewed article.

That's all I can coherently think of, for now. Goodnight."
" For the past few days, I've spent quite some time entertaining myself through the internet and one pattern that I noticed is literally everyone is younger than me, I mean I know I'm not that old(I'm 22) but there's always sinking feeling I get that everything I enjoy and want to experience is meant for people younger than me. There's nothing wrong with it but I feel so bad after knowing this, I wasn't able to enjoy most of my life due to many things and now suddenly I'm too old to do anything about it, I just feel I lost my time to do all the fun things, try new things and go crazy about whatever I want to because now I'm over that age. I don't have any grudge against anyone I mean even right now I'm not actively trying out many new things and will probably regret it in my thirties but the thing is I feel if I'll do all the crazy thing meant for your early twenties, I'll probably also miss out on my chance of doing something with my life instead of wasting it away. So, I'm constantly torn between living my life to the fullest or making my life better for the future and I don't want to have any regrets in the future. But I just feel life goes by too fast and by the time you realize that you just don't have the time or opportunities to do anything about it.

Thank you to anyone who actually read this"
"Lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of my friends and people on social media’s posting about the black lives matter movement and showing their support for it. They would write really impassioned paragraphs about it and seems to care about the cause. I wish I cared about it as much as them but I honestly don’t. And I’m tired of seeing posts about it. And it’s not just with this movement but with other things in life as well. I’m indifferent to everything. I wish I was more opinionated about things..."
"Hello,

My current roommate and I used to be inseparable best friends for a couple years, and have been roommates for a long time (close to 5 years). I used to be very naive - I didn't know how to set boundaries, didn't have the confidence to stand up for myself, and was too forgiving. This person is incredibly controlling, bossy, non-empathetic, and borderline narcissistic and I have endured what some other people in my life have titled her behavior as emotional abuse. I have only within the last year or so realized how detrimental this relationship has been to my mental health, self-esteem, and other relationships.

Below, you will find text screenshots of three different situations (only a few of many) that have happened within the last year and you can observe how she acts towards me and vice versa.

I will also note that one of the biggest fights we have ever had is not captured because I was so upset and distraught that I deleted the entire text conversation and can't find a way to recover it. Summarized, she became enraged when I told her I was going on a date with someone (who is now my SO of almost a year). She told me that I was depressed and lonely, and that I needed to get the idea of being in a relationship out of my head because it wasn't ever going to work out. I had spent two years prior to this being single and working a lot on myself and furthering my career after struggling with anxiety and some depression.

Situation 1: Accused of stealing butter [https://imgur.com/a/J415dd4](https://imgur.com/a/J415dd4)

Situation 2: The first night I stayed at my SO's place overnight because I was tired and couldn't safely drive home without my glasses (which I forgot) [https://imgur.com/a/7wl4Oaz](https://imgur.com/a/7wl4Oaz)

Situation 3: I had recently got a full time, salaried position in my career field after working in retail for nearly two grueling years. She was upset that we couldn't ever hang out, even though we lived together, watched TV together, made dinner together, but would never try to make plans with me outside of that. So it's my fault. [https://imgur.com/a/0h6zMDW](https://imgur.com/a/0h6zMDW)

I am just so frustrated with myself for being passive and so dismissive of her words and actions over the past and for how long it took me to realize that this relationship takes a massive mental toll on me and is not healthy at all. Luckily I have been doing some research and watching some videos on how to deal with somebody like this, and it's empowering to feel a sense of control over my own life for once, and to know that my experience is valid and not healthy, not just me ""overreacting"" or being ""too sensitive""."
"Today is my last day at work. Five years worth of boredom, fear, laughs and frustrations are coming to a close today. When I walked into this shitty, dusty little shack of a gas station five years ago, I figured I’d stay for a year, maybe. There was something charming about it though.   

Maybe it was the many eccentric regular customers. I saw these people every single day. I learned what brand of cigarettes they smoked. I got to know them. I met some good friends, and I met my boyfriend. I heard the life stories of strangers, and watched the human drama of many people play out in real time. 

Maybe it was the coworkers. They came and went. No one but the manager Amanda stayed as long as I did. They all stayed for varying lengths of time, and they all found a spot in my heart, and some empathy for their own personal struggles and stories. We were all in it together, really. Us in this grimy little shack against the world. 

Sometimes it was scary. I was robbed once, and I quickly became very, very aware of my surroundings when I worked in the evening, and the store was surrounded by darkness just outside the reach of the lights. 

Sometimes it was boring. I’d go five hours without encountering another soul. I read a lot of books here.

When I was offered my new job at the restaurant two weeks ago, I gratefully accepted, and then walked out to my car and started sobbing. I knew it was time to move forward on the path. Nothing can last forever, and I could use a change of pace. But I grew up at that dirty little gas station, and it’s been my home since I was just 19 years old. 

So now I’m nearing the end of my last shift. It’s a slow Saturday morning shift, and I’m looking around at everything that has surrounded me every day, and I’m trying to take a permanent mental picture. Four hours to go until I turn in my key and walk out, and leave this chapter behind."
"I am currently going through the painful process of (inadvertently) triggering long suppressed memories of childhood sodomization and apparently, some kind of strange training that included me hold my arms up at shoulder height with my arms bent slightly inwards at my elbows, hands, palm down, about a foot apart from each other.

&#x200B;

It started in January, 2019, when I threw out my back having bathtub sex with my husband.  It was remarkably embarrassing writing, ""tub sex"" on the medical intake form at the ER.  (worst ER visit of my life) An injury that should have taken two months to heal will likely take years, both physically and emotionally.    See, when I went to the chiropractor after the ER they took x-rays and noted that my pelvic bone was tilted in such a way that it indicated a ""childhood trauma to the pelvic bone"" that was never treated.  My entire body grew crooked around my tilted pelvic bone.

&#x200B;

I've been going to physical therapy, that's what triggered the first memory.  I was in the bathroom doing ball squeezes (ball between the thighs, both feet planted flat foot on the floor, sitting up straight, squeeze it to death with ever fiber of your being for 5 seconds, then release).  Ball squeezes open up SI joints, like squeezing pliers to open the mouth.

&#x200B;

>\>The **sacroiliac** (SI) **joints** are formed by the connection of the **sacrum** and the right and left iliac bones. The **sacrum** is the triangular-shaped bone in the lower portion of the spine, centrally located below the lumbar spine.

\-google

&#x200B;

Anyway, I stood up, and flexed my core muscles and the muscles that the ball squeezes activate too.  I felt my pelvic bone slowly tilt back into place (super ultra mega weird.  Like, weirder than having a baby move around  inside).  As soon as my pelvic bone tilted  back into place I had the most horrific cascade of overwhelming horrifying emotions.  Shame, \*terror\*, guilt, rage, betrayal, hurt, all of these bright and vibrant emotions with \*no cognizant memories\* attached.  Never in my life had I ever experienced such a horrifying and bizarre combination.  And there's more, it wasn't just crazy emotions.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You know how muscle memory works?  You do the same thing over and over and eventually you can do it without thinking about it at all.  It's how folks learn how to touch type, how we learn to walk, talk, dance, ride a bike, write . . .etc    I once watched a Cake Boss episode where the owner literally made \*and decorated\* a cake \*blind folded\*.  It was all muscle memory for him.  Even making the little frosting flower that goes on top.

&#x200B;

>\>**Phantom pain** is **pain** that feels like it's coming from a body part that's no longer there. Doctors once believed this post-amputation phenomenon was a psychological problem, but experts now recognize that these real sensations originate in the spinal cord and brain.Oct 30, 2018

\-google

&#x200B;

So, while I've never had anything amputated.  I have experienced what I can only \*describe\* as phantom pain.  When my pelvic bone tilted back into place I \*felt\* this, empty cavity deep inside me, and my body \*knew\* to expect searing hot pain right there in that empty part. Imagine touching a red hot oven element only to discover not only it doesn't hurt, it does no damage to your hand at all because it was simply well drawn art.  Your hand would expect pain, you would cognizantly expect pain.  I did not cognizantly expect pain, my \*body\* did.  And I don't even know if there is a word for that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I have to cut this short.  I didn't think I'd be writing this long.  I gotta go pick up my loving Husband. I've been writing poetry and creating art to help me process all these feelings.

&#x200B;

As a result of whatever happened in my childhood (and was completely forgotten until this year), I grew up a walking rape victim.  I was, it seemed, trained to be just that.  Here's [art](https://picsart.com/i/image-freetoedit-307869999250201#) I made depicting that.

&#x200B;

edit fixed the link I hope. I was planning to write more but now it's late and I should sleep.  Also, I do have a therapist for anyone thinking  I should maybe be in therapy.  She's made of amazing."

An Old Diary Ignited New Ideas

Nearing 30 years old, it’s pretty safe to say that I arrived way too early for the mid-life crisis convention that is my current reality. Wading through the devastation I caused myself, I find myself in total life-recovery. Even though I have a bachelor’s, had a taste of salary slavery, and made mostly intelligent choices in my young adulthood, my life started unraveling 2 years ago; it was burning down around me. I lost control of my life and myself. I found myself in a serious addiction and self-mandated isolation. Lost almost everything I owned. It was hard to wake up from that depression, and I battle my own self doubt every single day. 

I got sober without doctors. I have no insurance, so therapy is out of the question for right now. Thankfully I have a handful of amazing friends that keep trying even when I’m not. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder at the young age of 9 years old, after a traumatic incident. But I hate SSRI’s and tried almost all of them throughout middle and early high school. Then I said fuck it, I’ll just learn to deal. And I did, very well for a long time. 

Trauma always a nice way of sneaking up on us. 

Long story short, I’ve been in recovery and am actively in it every day. My failures in life are heavy, and I wear them on my shoulders every single day. Then thoughts rush of all my loved ones I’ve disappointed. I can’t seem to get anything right. On top of that I’m 100% positive that I possess severe body dysmorphia, just haven’t been properly diagnosed. Man… Sure do miss having insurance. 

Whenever I get emotional talking about how pathetic my life is right now, open mouths give me the same, exact token of advice. 

 “Love yourself. You have to love yourself first before you can even think of doing anything else.” 
 And every fucking time I eagerly inquire, “HOW?!” 

 My question is then followed by their apprehensive giggles and often a shoulder shrug. Because no one can explain how the fuck to turn the self-appreciation switch on. 

As angering as life is, it’s just more hard work I have to do… I am fully aware of how necessary it is that I begin reintroducing myself… To myself.  How do I trick my fucked brain into liking itself again? 

So I was sitting in my old room in my parent’s house… Yeah, it’s that sad… And I came across a couple of worn out spiral notebooks. I flipped them open and was immediately enthralled for a good few hours. I uncovered so many half-filled diaries and sketchbooks. I’ve always loved writing and drawing, but I forgot how much. Seeing all of my little drawings gave me ideas to challenge myself and my much-improved artistic skills. So the productivity ball is starting to roll in my head…

Then I pick up a little purple spiral notebook with a mischievous looking fairy on the cover. I opened it up and met myself from exactly a decade ago. I was so positive, self-nuturing, optimistic… It was confusing at first, because I don’t remember being so self-empowering. I know I hate myself… But after reading my 10 years younger version of self-love, I felt a quiver of hope tingle up my spine. I had no idea what I was in for when I wrote that diary entry, yet naive optimism poured all over those pages. 

So I want to re-meet myself. And I want to do so by documenting all of my random diaries and sketches, even the embarrassing stuff. I’m putting myself on somewhat of a blast – but it’s got a purpose. 

Be cautious… for although this is for a self-reintroduction in order to find love within myself again… This is me and these are my raw thoughts from all ages. 

It’s gonna get dark. It’ll get heavy. I’ll be finding clues to how my brain has always operated, but with intention of mastery and self-discovery. 

It’s also going to be hilarious as hell – I was/am a fucking weirdo. 

I’m performing a psychology experiment on myself. Taking pieces of my past to manifest success for my future. [My Diary Psychology Blog](mydiarypsychology.wordpress.com)"
"I saw a facebook post about my old friend who passed away 10 years ago. I remember the day I heard the news he had passed away. I was so heartbroken, because he was one of the best friends I ever had. I had known him from Middle School, and I went to his house often. We would play a lot of Halo 2, just dicking around and  not really taking the game seriously. We would talk about girls and nerdy stuff, tell dumb jokes, eat meals together. I slept over several times, which is one of my fondest memories. At school, we would throw caprisuns from the top of the hill that overlooked the basketball court of our school, and laugh when they exploded on the blacktop 😂. 

My friend's name was Zach. He had Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy, which is a disease that eats away at the muscled and causes them to atrophy. It currently does not have a cure, and is fatal. It kills by atrophying the muscles in the heart and other vital organs, causing total organ failure. The average lifespan for someone with the disease is 20 years. He died shortly after his 20th birthday. And as a kid, I never really thought about it. I thought his electric wheelchair was awesome, and sometimes rode on the back of it. I didn't care that he couldn't walk, because he was my friend. One of the only true friends I had in Middle School.  

It's been 10 years without you, buddy. I miss you. I hope you're doing well, wherever you are now. 

(I'm a bit of an emotional wreck right now writing this. )"
"I’m always everyone’s second choice. No matter what I do, I can’t make them choose me and love me the way that I love them. From now on I will try not to be attached and I will not love anyone wholeheartedly."
"Tomorrow, I'm going to be turning twenty-one years old. I can't go renew my license and get the regular proper adult license. I don't get to see my boyfriend tomorrow like we were talking about a few days ago. Instead of going to a bar with a group of my closest friends, I'll be staying inside with my family drinking a regulated amount of booze with my stepmother while celebrating my birthday.

Before, I pictured tomorrow as a celebration of making it through the worst of times. I have gone through more than someone of my age should go through in twenty-one years. I pictured this to be a time with friends and my boyfriend (the love of my life). I was waiting for this to be extreme, to walk out and enjoy the first day of adulthood and suck the marrow out of day 1. But I'll be in here and everyone else will be out there."
"A few minutes ago I used the bathroom that is right next to my bedroom. I simply used the toilet, washed my hands, and got out. In under 5 minutes.

I didn't leave a mess or anything.

When I got out of the bathroom I saw my sister standing there, arms crossed, and obviously angry.

She then tells me that the ""rule"" was that I wasn't allowed to use that bathroom. Then she goes to her room and slams her door.

It was really loud.

I'll admit, I knew about the ""rule."" But it was so unreasonable. The bathroom is right next to my bedroom. Less than 5 feet away.

Also, my sister got mad at my mom yesterday because she took me to the therapist first. My mom scheduled an appointment for my sister next week. My sister is mad because now she has to ""act nice"" around the therapist, mainly because she knows I told the therapist about the [situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/ej4guw/i_hate_my_sister_but_i_have_to_forgive_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) that happened.

I'm so tired.



(7:43 PM) Update: Wow. So much has unfolded in the past hour. So, my sister came into my room and started talking about [a text](https://imgur.com/a/y5SIK7e) I sent her. She was talking about how I had no place to be telling her to get therapy, and that she wasn't the one to bring the ants to the house. I asked her if she thinks that she's a toxic person, and she replied, ""I think everyone is a little toxic."" 

I don't really remember what my sister said, but it was enough to make me snap. She said something along the lines of ""You know you shouldn't be using the bathroom."" 

then I yelled, ""IT'S JUST A FUCKING BATHROOM!"" Then I started to cry.

My brother had also just come home at the time that I was crying. He pulled my sister away from my room, then comforted me.

I'm so so tired.


and I still have to do my homework."
"$325 to my name. I'm getting out of this town, and I'm going to a city far away. I'll make it, with love."
"Dear Dairy

If you had asked me a month ago my thoughts on xmas I would have said I have a love hate relationship with it.  Now it's mostly hate.  

I've been hating this stupid holiday for a long time.  It's too commercial.  Too much spend spend spend thrown in  your face rapid fire for the past six weeks.  I'm anxiously awaiting the day the kids are gone and I can refrain from doing this holiday and all it's get-up.  

But the truth of the matter is I'm scared.  I've always said my depression was seasonal.  Now, if history is any indication of how I handle it, I should slowly be getting out of this funk and ready to be my shiny happy people self.  But I'm scared I won't be that person, because that didn't happen last year.  Sure, situation was different last year.  The (dying) positive side of me wants to say ""fore warned fore armed"".  The pessist in me says ""yeah nice wish"" and the realist in me... well... the realist in me just wants to go take a nap."
"Argh!  Ok, I'm up.  Out of bed on Saturday morning.  I must get a haircut because I have not had one since I can't remember.  The only think keeping me looking fabulous is tons of hair goop - or as some people call it, ""product"" whatever the fuck that is.

&#x200B;

After my haircut I need to drive back to the house (30 min) pick up the wife and drive another 90 minutes to the ""beach house"" if you want to call it that.  It’s on a river in the middle of nowhere in a town where you have to drive 45 minutes away just to see a movie.  We bought it years ago thinking we would use it as a weekend getaway.  We have been renting it out to a couple with three kids for that entire time, so I doubt we will ever actually use it ourselves.  Picture two people in their mid 20s who are unemployed and get social security because of the kids. 

&#x200B;

I'm dreading this trip not only because of the drive but also because I have decided that I really don’t want to deal with this house anymore.  I tried to call the renters this week to tell them that we were coming down to sign a lease for another year and the phone is disconnected.  WTF?  So, I am scared as to what I will find when I get down there.  The rent check has always come on time, so they have some goodwill stored up with me, but I just really don't want to deal with this.  If the housing market didn't suck, I'd sell the house, but I want to wait for a couple of years until the market rebounds.

&#x200B;

The wife and I are not getting along.  It seems that we are both unhappy.  She does not like the fact that I work so much.  I just don't find her to be supportive.  I can't tell her my problems because she really does not want to hear them.  I told her about some issues from childhood that were bothering me, and her response was that I should have gotten over it by now and that she did not want to hear about it.  She asks me how my day is and when I tell her, she complains that I talk about work too much.  Well, my day is my work.  I just don't know.   Then there is the lack of sex/passion issue.  We have sex only about five or six times a year.  If our sex life was better, I wouldn't need to have web cam sex all the time.  I brought up the idea of counseling and she shut that down by saying ""Don't even go there"".  It just feels like she is not willing to make our marriage better.  I find myself thinking about divorce...but not seriously. 

&#x200B;

My wife thinks that because she cooks and cleans that I should be grateful. I am, but you know what, I have told her a million times that I am happy to get us a maid and chef.  Frankly, I can pay for someone to cook and clean...I can't pay them to support me and listen to me. Maybe I need a second wife?  Someone I can share my feelings with and who'll do all the things she doesn't.

&#x200B;

We got into a ""discussion"" over the credit card.  She wanted to know why there was a $3,500 balance on the credit card.  Well, let's see, Labor Day weekend we spent $2,500 at a resort and spa.  Could that be part of it?  You had to take your car in for $400...shall I go on? She didn't care, she wanted me to take money out of savings to pay it off.  I told her that the savings was for emergencies and THIS (her freaking out) did not constitute an emergency. By the next day she came around to my way of thinking.  That's one more point for JACK - not that I'm keeping score mind you.

&#x200B;

Well, I need to get it the shower, so I can start and eventually end this day.  Tomorrow should be better. "
"He came back tonight. I was in the shower and he let himself in, made himself a bowl of cereal, and came and sat on the edge of the bath eating it in his full work clothes. 

He’s lucky I didn’t call the cops on him. I wasn’t expecting him to come back. Then again, he always pops up when I least expect him and most need him. 

We’ve talked on and off, of course, but I haven’t really *seen* him since September. Maybe that’s why there are so many songs about the month of September, people, places, and things, tend to fall apart around then. The seasons change. It’s a month of transitions, physical and emotional. But neither of us transitioned, we just kind of ground to a halt. 

Anyways, I think our break was one of the only truly deliberate, consensual breaks a couple has ever taken. We both agreed we needed to “take a break,” it wasn’t a break up, but we definitely were not together. We didn’t know what was going to happen. 

For three months I explored my other options. He worked on the road, like he would have had to in any case, and did.... whatever else he did. We haven’t talked about it yet. We’ve barely talked since he got back. 

That’s the thing about breaks though—even consensual ones—they take time to heal. 

Neither of us said “Hello,” which is par for the the course at this point. I asked where he’d been. He said, “Waiting for you to call.” I asked if he was moving back in. He said he was if I was letting him. 

We had sex, or, tried to. He couldn’t get it in. I was too overwhelmed, I think. I haven’t seen any human beings in days, then to suddenly see him, well, it was a lot to process. 

We just laid on the bathroom floor for a few minutes instead. He brushed my still soaking wet hair back and hummed lines from that Jeffrey James song that’s been stuck in my head lately, “We were golden, where did we go.” 

No idea how he’d know I’ve been listening to the song so much, since we haven’t talked in over two weeks, but we always seem to be in sync about that kind of thing. I even went to the liquor store last week, not knowing when he’d be back, and of course I don’t drink. 

He didn’t tell me he was coming back. He didn’t know until just before he was on the way home, and I think he thought I’d be asleep. 

I’m lying in bed, listening to him shower, and I can smell his shaving cream through the steam coming out from under the door. It’s the most comforting sensation I’ve experienced in weeks.

He’s picking out pajamas right now. He’s still got a few things in drawers here, but if I don’t unpack that suitcase I have a feeling he’ll just live out of it unless/until he leaves again. 

It will probably be a stabilizing agent to have him back. We’re both such workaholics, and he’s so insightful about my work, not just the projects that directly concern him, either. 

I’m so tired and I have to wake up so early, otherwise I’d want to spend tonight talking to him until we both passed out mid-sentence. 

Yes his flaws are inescapably serious but his strengths are overpowering. 

I think we can give ourselves permission to enjoy one another’s company for the time being. If things change, they change. No reason for us not to enjoy the present because of what the future may or may not be. 

Any moment he’ll collapse into bed and he’s had a long day too. I want to go to the farmers market tomorrow early in the morning to try and get some decent produce, support the locals, feel wholesome, etc. and I know he’s already thinking he picked the wrong day to come back. I’ll let him sleep if he wants to, of course, but I secretly hope he’ll decide to come with or without sleep. 

The break is over. The holiday break, the emotional break, all at their end. Now we can really get started. Now we can heal up stronger."
"A week ago, I was living at my parents house and got into a yelling match with some of my family. Out of absolute anger, I grabbed my little backpack (that acts as my purse), grabbed my keys, and left without saying bye to anyone. I didn’t know I wouldn’t be able to go back home after this. 

I ended up drinking in my car by myself for a bit, then went to my boyfriends house because I was still a little too upset to go home. I have a complicated home life.

The next day is just a whatever day. Still hadn’t gone home, but my sister calls me and tells me she needs to get tested for covid. So the worry starts. Day after that, still waiting, full with absolute anxiety. My mom and step dad start feeling off. More anxiety. I start over analyzing every single feeling in my body. Start hoping they just have the flu. Next day - sister tells me that her bf tested positive. She tested inconclusive but figures she has it. My heart sinks and I’m scared for my family, but now I don’t feel comfortable going home. 

Weirdly enough, my bf and I ended up testing negative. We have no symptoms at all. But day by day, someone in my family would start showing symptoms. My mom, my step dad, my grandma (maybe), my sister, and my little brother all now have it. They’re all feeling pretty sick, and I’m really scared. 

I had to get groceries for them at one point and it sucked ass having to just drop them off at my front door without being able to hug them or my dogs. I couldn’t stop crying. 

Im constantly trying to keep my composure, but sometimes I can’t. I try not bother them too much with texts but sometimes I can’t help it. I just know that anything can happen in an instant. 

To top it off, since I had left my house so quickly that one night, I don’t have *any* of my stuff with me. It’s all at my house and I’m too scared to go in and pack and leave again. I’m not emotionally prepared nor do I wanna get sick. So I had to go buy new underwear and a toothbrush.

Anyway, I apologized to the ones I got into an argument with that night; we all easily forgave each other. That is now a nonexistent issue. I just want them all to feel better. I can’t wait till it’s safe to go back and see them again.

It’s weird to think that if the argument didn’t happen, I probably would have gotten covid too."
"I’ve long ago accepted that my role in life is to help the people I love and care for get through their days in whatever ways that I can. I’m not particularly good at anything, my career aspirations are unrealistic, my goals are all trivial, my life itself is meaningless, but the one thing I pride myself on is always being there for the people I care about and doing my best to support them however I can. And I will continue to do so.

I’m realizing more and more that I’m always the one reaching out, or messaging, or texting, or calling, or whatever it is. Apart from my immediate family, no one ever reaches out to me. No one else asks how I am. No one else checks in with me. No one else initiates contact. I understand that my friends and loved ones are busy and have their lives to live, so I do my best not to flood them with messages or texts or posts or anything. I wait at least few weeks or a month or so to make sure I’m not bothering them. I want to support the people I love, but I don’t want to be a nuisance.

And I’ve realized since I’m always the only one reaching out or checking in or what have you, I probably am just a nuisance. I’m just pestering the people I care about when I should be letting them get on with their lives. I should probably just let them go. They’ll always matter to me, but I feel like I’ve become an afterthought. I feel like I don’t matter to my friends anymore.

And that’s their choice, I respect that. They have their own lives to live. And it’s their business to decide what’s important and what to focus on and who to keep close to and keep contact with.

I just wish I was someone who people considered worth keeping in touch with."
"I feel like crying. But can't and I won't. Things going fine at work. Life is busy. I leave home at 9 am and reach back at 10-11 pm. Have dinner and sleep. Weekends make me realize how lonely I am.

The one things which pierces my heart is the fact that no girl ever had amy feelings for me in these 24 yrs of my life.

Tried tinder. But it's purely a pictures game. I do look fine but I think paid app would help u get match. Not sure. Girls are tooo much entitled on tinder. Its like a platform for them to make others feel like shit. I unmatched a few because I know I am not shit.

I want to talk to my bestfriend for whom I got feelings and asked her out and got rejected. And she said she is fine if I stop talking to her. And it's been a year since we have spoken. I miss her."
"Whoever is reading this book,

why are you reading this book?

I don’t know what this book is yet at the time I’m writing this; I just decided that I’d write a letter and use it as a bookmark, leave it, and hope someone finds it. 

Have you ever found an informal note or letter in a classroom? Near the lockers in a school hall? Maybe just missing a trash can, or outside on the pavement somewhere in a parking lot. Maybe it served as a bookmark?

The intention of this letter in being abandoned is something like that. More purposeful, though. Like writing ""Hi!"" on a schooldesk.

Whatever the fate of this book is, I want this letter to go along with it, organically. Maybe it will wind up in a used book store or a thrift shop. Maybe it will be left unread along with the book for a hundred years in someone's then deceased grandma's attic.

I like to imagine this letter will travel far in this book. I want this book to find itself far away. Another state, or country, even. Imagining it staying here in Oregon is boring. I have lived in Oregon my whole life and never been out of state. I don't know how far in life I will go, so it's comforting to imagine something I sent out into the world will go far.

I'm also embarrassed that someone I know will find this, if this book never leaves the area-- not that they’d know who I am. 

There was a book I read in grade school by Jerry Spinelli. A kid and his friends go around town vandalizing places with spray paint. The kid spray paints a brick at a worksite. The brick will be invisible once the construction there is finished. The kid's reasoning for vandalizing something that will be hidden is because cicadas go underground for 32 years as a part of their lifecycle before re-emerging again. Just as cicadas re-emerge, the kid's vandalization will be rediscovered.

As a kid, I thought that was a nice thought, but also a dumb one. Now, I still think it’s a nice thought, because I get it, and that’s the point.

So, do I leave something meaningful behind in this letter, then, or just leave this thought? 

I think all anyone wants is to be understood, accepted, and ultimately, loved-- though that last part is reserved for one's partner, existing or not yet met. I do know, at least, that understanding and acceptance are prerequisites to love. 

I’m just trying to get my stuff out there in my own small, meaningful way. But I’ll try to keep these letters short, a single front-to-back page each. I won’t get too hung up on being understood, and I’ll try to be comforted by these small things."
"Tonight, I had a rare encounter, and one that I hope I'll never see again. As I was driving up to my place, I saw a vehicle parked to the side of the road and the horn honking. At first, I thought it was the driver pressing the lock button on their remote a few times, but then I noticed that the parking lights were solidly on. Then, as I drove further to investigate, I noticed two, tiny hands waving for my help, along with a small, crying face. Three kids were in the car and crying for help.

There were two girls and one boy. The oldest one, the one who was smart to honk the horn to get my attention, told me that the boy's mom, the one who drove them here, said she was going into the adjacent house and ""never come back"". Long story short, it seemed that the mother had some kind of domestic issue with a husband or ex-boyfriend, I'm not exactly sure. I ended up calling the police, which, while I didn't really want to, I had an unsettling feeling that this estranged man had killed the mom. If I was to knock on that door and ask if the mom could come out and take the kids home, I had a premonition that I would've gotten a face filled with lead from a shotgun.

Thankfully, none of that happened. I did give them most of my dinner to eat and calm them down. They seemed relieved and happy to see me. The cop came and, long story short, the kids were reunited with their guardian, the mother. Then, she drove away with them.

Seeing those kids cry left an imprint on me. I'm not trying to be melodramatic, but I can still see that girl's face and how she was crying. I know it was none of my business, but I couldn't leave them like that, especially so late at night. Oh, and by the way, the car was unlocked. With the engine running. Yeah, so if any creep came along and decided to kidnap them, well, it would've been too easy.

Just before I left, I saw the mom come out. She looked fine, physically, at least, but I still worry about those kids. Again, I know, it's none of my damn business, but, still...ugh. I just don't like to see kids cry.

I feel like I did my civic duty in helping them, even if the police wasn't all that necessary. Whatever. What's done is done, and nobody got hurt, so, mission accomplished in my book.

I was gonna ask what is wrong with people, but by this point in my life, that would be a rhetorical question."
"The boss told me today that I'm paid more than the other people on the team. I told him qualifications aren't cheap (jokingly), he laughed. As I left to meet my friends, I noticed that I was really happy he told me that.  then I felt disappointed in myself that I'm happy for no real reason. As I drove to the flat I wondered, Am I actually happy in a general sense of the word?  

 It might sound like false self assurance, but I know I am happy. Nobody's life is perfect, mine isn't close, but I know I have a basic deluxe package by my lowest guesstimation. I have a great family.. . but they ~~hate~~ don't like me, I know it's partially my fault because of tendency for casual heresy , or as I like to call it: ""logic"". I'm sure as far as they're concerned, that's secondary to my risk seeking behaviour or "" bouts of occasional dishonour"" as they like to call it.

I have a wonderful job that is challenging and stimulating, but it's not what I want to do, yet I can't quit for now because I am under-worked and overpaid, which would be absolutely dreadful to change. I am not rich by rich people standards, but considering that I once had to sleep hungry so as not to stave the next day, I'd say I do ok, compared to my past self and my present peers.

I am single, with no prospects, but considering that 2 of my exes are still texting me, I do not feel unwanted, and my group of friends keeps me from feeling lonely. Though my friends are degenerates by most traditional and modern values, I don't think they're bad people and I like to think we bring out the best in one another which is what counts. Here's what I struggle to reconcile, non of my married friends are loyal, I don't judge, but it terrifies me. Some of them are better than me - at least on paper- yet they still cheat! What makes me so certain that I won't? I guess I am not certain... But I fucking wish I could be.

I have a minor nicotine problem, and when I drink it becomes a major nicotine problem, but I drink rarely, and I can still run a 10k in under an hour and get bored of swimming before I tire. I like the fact that I never stopped trying to quit, and that my nicotine consumption is in decline, but I really want it to be non existent because it is a disgusting habit.

Although a lot of these calculations might net zero, I think what I have going for me is a sense of purpose, I have a goal in mind, and I am inching towards. Things go wrong occasionally, sometimes they go very wrong, I am way behind schedule, but I am stumbling in the right direction, I guess that's the bottom line."
"Wholesome memes can't get me by. I just end up living the same fucking day over and over, wasting most of my time sleeping, unmotivated to do anything - because I can't afford anything.

My husband works over 55 hours a week and I hardly see him. But he's the major bread winner in this household so without his hours we lose our house. Everything in this fucking society revolves around money, and squeezing every ounce of energy out of your worker while nickel-and-diming them. 11 years at his current job, and he just broke $16! I'm not trying to belittle that, but fuck, he works so fucking hard that he comes home exhausted. He works in a retirement community where rich WASPS live spending literal millions to live on the property with various levels of nursing needs. It's even expanding to add more homes! But! They're not going to hire a single new staff member. 

My work is seasonal, and I make minimum wage. Because, y'know, why get a fair shake in life? And since the work is slowing, on closing nights I'm alone in the building.

I have no passion to make art. Worthless scribbles. I've spent 10 years getting dicked around by the furry community. Projects I've dumped weeks of my life into, only to get stiffed, or be received without a thank you or pictures. I've even wound up with ""friends"" who only see me as free art, a ride, or a sucker. One expected me to come to a baby convention (like adult baby) and ""watch me get flogged."" I can't stand it anymore.

I have skills, but none that are viable for the future. I lost my passions as 2008 destroyed my family, we've never really recovered. I'm tired of my mom crying, I'm tired of my estranged nephew, I'm tired of my dad's racism, I'm tired of being alive. 

People only care for a moment when they read these kinds of posts, ""noooo don't you have so much to live foooor."" Yeah, a continued service to a machine that only takes. Hundreds of thousands of people like me drowning and we all look to each other for help, only to pull one another down. Money would solve so many problems, but you don't just *get* money.

And it's all just face value interactions. No one really gives a fuck. It's just a tick in the box, I did a good thing today! Give me cake! Does anyone want to help support me? No. I have to entertain you like a monkey! That's how Patreon and Youtube work. Even $1 a month is too much for someone who makes no content. 

I'm a nobody."
"I was informed today by my family that an old neighbor of ours died just today. He was 78-years old, and had been battling with COPD, heart disease and god-knows what other conditions he was fighting against. Unfortunately, this all took a final toll on him and he passed away sometime this morning.

I didn't talk too much to the old man when I was a kid. He preferred his solitude, according to his wife who is still alive, and only really spoke with his family members. I didn't find out too much about his history except from the fact that he developed COPD because he used to smoke cigarettes a lot. His wife said he was a chain smoker in his early years, going through between sometimes 3 to 5 packs a day. By some miracle, he never developed lung cancer, as far as I know, but those years of smoking killed his lungs to the point where he had to carry and don a mobile oxygen concentrator everywhere he went.

It's going to take a while before the reality sets into my mind that he'll never be coming back. I'm not crying, but I am mourning his death because in the few times I did speak with him, he seemed like a sweet old man. I regret not interacting with him more often.

Dammit, now as I write this, I'm starting to get tears in my eyes. I remember my father did favors for him on fixing his vehicles and taking him to the hospital a few times. His condition had worsened so badly that he wasn't able to operate a vehicle safely anymore. When the pandemic came over here, it was an even bigger risk since the virus primarily targets the respiratory system. I used to watch his grandkids coming to say hi to their grandfather, only to be met with a barrier between them due to the risks from the virus.

They celebrated his final birthday this year, during this summer. He looked so happy, even with his current condition.

I can't believe he's dead, but according to his wife, it did seem he was suffering day by day and his condition got worse and worse. They had him on palliative care at the hospital, so they knew he was going to die soon.

I normally don't like to shoehorn things in, but for anyone reading this, don't smoke. I can't say about the effects of vaping or marijuana, but cigarette smoke--any tobacco smoke, really--will kill you. If you plan on smoking, don't. And if you're already doing it, it's never ""too late"" to quit, especially when you're young. Getting COPD is not something that you want to have. Developing things such as emphysema and bronchitis is a son of bitch to have, including the fact that you could get throat, mouth or lung cancer. There is no cure for any of the conditions with COPD, and as you get older, it becomes extremely difficult for the tissue in your lungs to heal.

I sound like an ad from the CDC right now, but for those of you thinking about quitting, it's not impossible. You *can* quit. Whenever you have the courage and time to do so, talk to your doctor about how you're thinking of quitting. They'll most likely refer you to a psychiatrist because as it stands, cigarette smoking is an addiction and needs to be treated as such.

I've a personal vendetta with COPD because I'm in a lab investigating it, along with other effects from cigarette smoking. If I sound overly passionate about this, it's because I am.

As for you, Mr. E, I know you'll never see this but I hope you're at peace now. I wish I knew you better and I wish we had more time to talk. I would've loved to talk to you about all the work I'm doing right now to, hopefully, make the world a better place.

We'll all miss you.

\-S"
"

For a while I thought I was full. Of friendship and love and happiness. Of confidence and laughter. Of smiles and joy. Since everything went down hill, I’ve been finding it harder and harder to stay positive. To stay golden and warm. To be full. It’s taken everything out of me to pretend. To put on a mask. To act well. I’m struggling inside. I feel empty. Pathetic. Tired. 

I don’t know how I get out of bed some days. I don’t remember if I’ve eaten. I don’t even turn on the tv anymore. I just sit. In the silence. Thinking it will help. Thinking it will calm me down. But lately everything’s just been so hard. I feel so tired. Tired of trying to do everything right. Tired of pretending. Tired of being tired. And yet. I can’t ever sleep. 

I can’t find peace with slumber and dreams that I used to use to escape my constant running thoughts. I lay awake for hours into the morning in silence. The birds outside finally telling me to pull my body up and get ready for something. I can’t figure out what I’m scared of more. The draining lack of emotions during the day, or the overwhelming senses of emotions at night that hit me so hard I can barely breathe. And then you repeat. The same thing. Every day. Every night. Over and over. Will it stop? I don’t want to be hollow anymore. I feel so broken. And I am so scared."
"Dear Diary, 

As you know, every year my entire extended family gets together in cabins for a week at a state park. I have a fairly large extended family - my grandma had five kids and 11 grandkids, and a huge assortment of family friends that always show up as well. We've been doing this for decades now and I've been able to grow up with my cousins. Some of us are now married (some with kids) and have gotten our own cabin as a right of passage. We always love the reunion and it is literally the highlight of most of our years.

Of course, this year, there's a pandemic on, and everyone was kind of ignoring it and making plans. A few people/families had backed out, but the majority was going ahead. Another mention here - a lot of us drive from all over, including states like GA, FL, VA, etc. From my place, it's a two day drive from GA up to where we reunite, which takes me through very high caseload areas.

A year or two ago, I wouldn't have really considered this an issue, and just thought ""meh, I know how to be safe,"" but this year marks one year into a degree in epidemiology and public health. My family is older, all of my aunts and uncles are now over 60, and some with underlying conditions, and the youngest cousin is 22. I started having misgivings myself about going, thinking that if I picked something up at a rest stop and then spread it around, I would never forgive myself, especially if someone had lifelong issues or died from it.

I drafted an email yesterday morning and then spent the rest of the day talking my husband to death about the issue (he already couldn't go this year for work commitments so he had no dog in the fight), calling a close cousin, messaging my sister, and trying my best to search my heart, mind, and soul about it. Did I really want to be the one to say that we shouldn't do our decades-long tradition this year? Does my commitment to my degree require me to do this? Am I overreacting to the data and the situation?

This morning, I just took a deep breath and sent out my email to everyone. I was so worried that people would send things back like ""we don't need to worry,"" and ""it's too late to cancel,"" or the like. But I actually got people thinking and talking and as a result, my family canceled along with another one. Now there's just two families going that live in the same state as the park so I mean, I guess that's better than traveling through some of the more spiky states. I just feel so much better knowing that I did my best to keep everyone safe in these trying times and that most of my family supports me. I got several compliments on my actual writing too which is always nice because I don't really like writing that much (which is awesome when you're doing a master's degree haha).

Anyways, I just wanted to remind myself that it's not always easy to be the one to step up and go against the grain and against your family, but sometimes you have to be the one to break group-think. And if you think something, someone else may be thinking the same thing. So raise your hand in class, ask questions, question authority when they do stupid things, and remember that the right thing isn't easy and the easy thing may not be right."
"Dear diary,

Today was a good day :)"
"Sometimes I feel stressed for no reason. I guess that's called anxiety.

I try to take care of myself. Self care is important, right? It never seems enough, though. Maybe I would be considerably more anxious if I didn't practice self care?

I'm trying to get myself to emotionally binge eat less lately. Eating has always been a great stress relief for me. It can be super difficult when my boss shows up with Milk Bar bday truffles. 

UGH"
"You are enough. You are worthy. You are wanted. You are important. You have purpose. You are beautiful. 
You are ineffable.

I look through your posts when I miss you, because I'd rather see your past words than bother you. I know them better than I should. I have two pictures of you and I look at them a lot, when I miss you. They look like you, yes, but there is something about your eyes that isn't captured in photos. Your hazel is layered; seagrass waving in the deep wet shadows of night, the dark between your fingers clutching to damp emerald moss in a twilight wood.

I'm sorry I am who I am. I hate who I am and I hate who I am when you're around. I never want anything. But I want you and I hate myself for it. 
I lose my carefully curated control with you. You argue that I keep my composure very well but gods... I'm scared of how far gone I'll go for you. 

I'm not the good person you say you see. I'm stained, muddied, tainted. I'm a flaw or a glitch or a mistake personified. 
I'm manipulative, and bitter. Spiteful, and angry. Selfish, greedy, ravenous, and lie without thought. Pathetic, and low as a worm eating shit. A slave to my urges and whims. 

Nothing. 

I. Am. Nothing. 

The truth grapples in my throat and I vomit glass-shard lies because they hurt me less, even when it costs me you."
"Hi, I'm Jay. I guess you could say I'm a normal dude. 

&#x200B;

I ate an ice pop. I'm going to different country on Sunday. Today's wednesday. My cat killed a bird today, rest the bird's soul, but other than that, my day is pretty boring. But I have a feeling... That whatever happens to me next... will be VERY interesting. But right now I'm bored. Maybe PM me or something. That's all for now. Ciao."
"Before we start this story i want to give some background information: I live in a small town where everyone knows each other, Everyone grew up together with a few people transferring over from out of state. Basically everyone is really close. Lets begin

Listen to my story, before it's too late

 I am currently a Junior in high school and i have came to the realization that I may not see my Senior friends everyday (graduation is May 21st last senior day is May 16th), shit or every again for that matter... During our last day of our school play someone that has essentially been my mentor and best friend since the fifth grade named Vance said his closing lines ""This is Alex Crumb signing off till next year."" What he didn't tell the cast (even the director didn't know) was his line he created ""This is Vance, signing off for good."" During this moment my heart dropped, I then realized that everyone has grown up and...we have to move on. Since then every ones mood around the high school has changed, nothing is the same i can't even look back at the friends i have made because one day..I might not remember them. The saddest thing is that most people will never see each other again. This hit me the hardest freshman year, I hate this year

So my freshman year i was an average kid doing my work and getting by. But on March 14th 2011 i got a phone call at 9:34 A.M from my best friends Mom telling me ""Ethan, There is no easy for me to say this but last night Cody passed away."" From that day on i have always wondered, What would have happen if he didn't pass away. What would he accomplish. The worst part is i will never forget the last thing he said to me ""Don't worry, One day we'll be famous Ethan, we wont to worry about a thing. Even if we get famous for different reasons we will still be friends, right?"" damn, still hits me hard. Every day i read that same text over and over again hoping this was a bad dream, but it was a reality not to me but to my class mates. Ever since then we have basically had a curse where at least one person dies in our class year. Freshman year it was Cody. Sophomore year was Mary and Smidge. Junior year was some new kid no one knew, mainly because he smelled bad, if everyone was so judgmental he might of not taken his life..


High school is supposed to be a time where you have fun have the time of your lives not morn for the ones lost. This high school experience isn't over and i want it to be. I have dealt with several things since my freshman year till now.

I understand i should expect my senior year to be the hardest saying good bye. I just thought it'd be easier. If maybe the people didn't pass away it would be easier. If some how My friends read this I just wanna say. Knowing each and everyone of you has been such an honor to be called your friend. If it wasn't for you guys I might not have made it this far. Anyway this is just an overview of my experience in high school there are several other stories I wish to tell if the future depending if anyone is curious.

Thank you for your time"
"Five dollars. That's all I need. Just five fucking dollars and I could at least hold myself over for the next few days. It such a small amount and yet it feels impossible to come by. I've tried online surveys, but you have to have earned a minimum amount of money before you can withdraw and there aren't that many surveys available (apparently). I've tried asking friends and family to support me by buying some of my tracks (they're a dollar each, some are even less) but...I guess none of them are able. I've asked for assistance from online assistance groups but those have gone nowhere.

I feel like five dollars shouldn't be this hard to come by and yet here I am, awestruck at just how helpless I am. I think I have a newfound respect for the homeless and destitute (thankfully my situation's not that bad). I can't imagine how overwhelming and frustrating that sense of helpless must be for them. A few dollars doesn't seem like it should be hard to come by but god damn it sure can be.

Anyway, I'm not sure what the point of this post is. I'm not looking for any advice, I guess I just needed to vent"
"Last week I went through a series of interviews for a mentorship I've been eyeing for the past two years. It's with my professional idol; one of the people in the world who have my dream job. So I was very excited to interview for the possibility of studying under them for the next year.

Due to insecurities and self doubt, I never imagined that I have done enough in my life to deserve the mentorship, so I went in and treated it as a test interview for ""next year"". All was going really well, until I interviewed with my professional idol. They interviewed me, and immediately after was like ""You're the kind of person who should be doing this mentorship. It's people like you that we do this for"".

On one hand, It felt refreshing; like a huge weight of self doubt was just dropped off my shoulders. On the other hand, I was shocked and every other synonym for it. Especially when they told me how much it would cost.

Aside from the global pandemic and barely any relief support from the US Gov't for my line of work, I'm feeling the pressure to decide between taking the step to pursue my goals I've been working towards for years, or to being able to survive day to day life. I've never been the sort of person to ask for help or support, and truthfully- I'm at a point in my life where it feels like I have to turn to Reddit to even share these sort of life changing moments/conundrums to even feel remotely heard.

I've tried to apply for a second and third job just to be able to afford living and the mentorship, but you know... global pandemic and all.

It's not a fun place to be in, but I appreciate you all taking the time to listen and allowing me to share.

Til next time."
"I am feeling quite sad since last 2-3 days. I feel quite disconnected. I am living in a place where I have no one I can call friend. I am not even sure if it is me or the place. I feel people hate me or at least want to get rid of me or avoid me or whatever. I feel unwanted.

I guess it is ok to feel like that sometime. I have to be grateful for this life and the opportunities it provides me with. I should be grateful for the family I have who support me. I do have some anger towards them for my childhood but for a long time now they have supported me unconditionally. I made some friends since and I have had some great moments with them. I have managed to move forward and achieve my goals despite these mental issues. I have struggled with relationship but I have tried to improve myself and learn from the experience.

I guess I just have to move past these feelings. It is temporary and like my days of strange excitement this will pass too. I also think that I am caring a lot about what people think of me. I am aware of that feeling and I am in control of that. I will just try to ride this feeling/emotion out and move forward towards the goals I have set."
"Lately, I’ve just been feeling tired of everything. I don’t feel like talking to anyone. It takes a lot of energy for me to carry a conversation with someone. I used to care for the homeless people I see on the streets, but now, I don’t even bat an eye when I see them. I used to have crushes and get butterflies, but I haven’t felt any attraction towards anyone in a long time. I feel like I’m becoming more antisocial and cynical as I get older, and I’m only 20 going on 21. I feel like an empty can that’s just going through the motion."
"There is like a valve inside my mind. It's leads to where she resides. In the hidden dark she cries. She screams and scratches at her eyes. Can't unsee what is despised. She's hard and hollow, crafty, mean. Beautiful like shattered glass, delights in the obscene. Broken shards glitter reflect back what they want to see. Their own dark flames lit up in me. 
Fools see their reflection scattered in her soul.  See themselves as beautiful, love her shiny glow. She dances with them, let's them lead, while she unwinds their every need. She satisfies desires they didn't know they had.  She builds them up, they feel like new, how wonderfully mad.  
She is sexy and enticing, she is harsh and full of rage.  She is inviting and conniving, a backwards sage.  Judgment through experience. She's clever, wicked, smart. Manipulating everyone from the very start. 

Born of malicious obscenity.  She who knows no serenity. Father heal her. May she know, Holy You, may she grow and be made new.  Unmake her hurt, heal the dead. Help her see her Holy bed. Full of grace, not brave defiance. Full of hope, on God reliant.  Holy God help her learn, be the fuel for her to burn. 

Melt her down, make her unhollow.  Fill her up, help her follow."
"I just finished my first appointment with my new therapist, and she's absolutely amazing. She asked me a bunch of questions, which my old therapist would never do, and she actually made me realize a lot of things about myself. I really feel like my life is going to improve if I continue seeing her.

I can't wait for my next appointment."
"Life as usual. I don't know why/how I am not depressed even though nothing in my life is sorted. Fucked up in my MBA entrance exam. Due to preparation of exam, my chances of getting promoted at work is bleak but my manager assured that I will get promoted.

Life is running fast. 2019 made me wise. 2019 made me immune to heartbreaks. 2019 taught me failure. 2019 made me humble and spendthrift. Made me ready for life.

Just started reading a book, The Power of Awareness and it is really helping as if there is some magic in every human being. The book says to have a strong desire for what you want and assume u already have it. Feel that energy you would possess when u achieve what u want. I don't know if it's just a mind trick or whatever. But if it helps me then I don't care if it's a science or pseudoscience. Only thing which is hampering me is my habit of watching porn and jerking off daily. 

I am a part of nofap grp etc etc. But its not helping me. My brain tricks me to believe that porn and masturbation is the only pleasure in my life. To some extent it is true. I never had a gf. Never hooked up. Never kissed. Was an academic and career oriented guy since childhood and assumed that having a gf is a distraction. Now after 2 heartbreaks( got rejected twice) in a span of 4-5 yrs. I don't feel like falling in love again.

This is one part of my life where I am miserable. I am in the bottom of the crowd when it comes to love life. This part of my life sucks. The main emptiness in me is due to the fact that no one ever in this world had feelings for me. And i am not a teenager. I am fucking 24 yo. I have somehow accepted this. And don't have the zeal to pursue a girl anymore. If she never developed feelings for me despite being such close friend of 2 yrs, no one ever would"
"So, I have a superpower. It allows me to forget. Anything traumatizing, anything, I don't \*want\* to remember.   I first discovered this trait in myself when I realized I have absolutely no memory of what happens to me after they take my baby away (to be cleaned, weighed etc) while they stitch me up during a c-section.

At the time, I'd already had 3 c-sections.  I was pregnant with our 5th kid and was trying to remember how I got from the operating room, to the recovery room, after each cesarean.   I vividly recall every part of each cesarean birth, \*everything\*, up until they start cleaning me out and stitching me up.  It's like, in my memories, I'm in the OR, I'm in my recovery bed receiving my baby from my husband.  Like, I blinked and there we were.  Poof. Why? How? 

\* gory details of 3rd c-section(fourth child) to provide context for 4th c-section(fifth kid). 

C-Day for kid number four.  Now,  I used to think that when the doctor's cut into me that it was one long smooth stroke, like you see in autopsies on TV.  I now know, it is instead, several small strokes in one line, like an artist sketching.  I *know* this because that is what I *felt*.  To this day, hospital staff do not believe that I could feel anything because,

>""If you could feel that you would have been writhing in pain, screaming in agony.""

But here's the deal.  THEY HAD A SHARP BLADE THISCLOSE TO MY BABY!  Of course I kept dead still!  Of \*course\* I was dead silent!  I can't have the surgeon jumping around with a blade in my skin!  Of *course* I'm willing to suffer torture in absolute silence with even breaths for my almost born baby.  It was one of the most awful experiences I've ever had.  (How did I know how to maintain my breathing through such torture?)  Anyway, They take her out, show her to me while they start wiping out the inside of my uterus (I almost scream when he goes, what feels like under my freaking ribs with a (dry?) washcloth(whatever they use to wipe out the fluids),  I see her beautiful face, I get lost in her scent.  Then they take her away to weigh her, clean her, put goop in her eyes etc.  I \*insist\* my husband goes with our baby.  \*Always\*.  I'm not there to supervise stranger (albiet experienced) hands touching my kid, so he goes in my stead.  I trust my husband, not these barbarians that don't trust a woman who says she can feel.  I look at the ceilling, then nothing.  

&#x200B;

It didn't make any sense. So I vowed right then to figure out what happened after they take baby.

And here it is.  

I have a new O.B.G.Y.N.  She's only been my doctor for a year.  After feeling \[torture\] from last kid's c-section  I steadfastly \**insist*\* that \*NO BLADE\* shall touch my skin until I confirm I can no longer feel touch.  The ansthesologist wants to use a spinal like the last time really bad.  I say,

>""NO.  Last time they did that I could feel it.  But I've had epidurals before and haven't felt a thing.""  

So he sets me up with an epidural.  Only, I can't feel it. I mean, I \**can*\* feel.  I can't feel the numb.  It has always worked in the past, suddenly I cannot feel the numb.  I keep telling the nurses I can feel it when they think I can't.   They think it's in my head again, they start trying to distract me and touch me on the sneak to see if I say anything when they know I can't see them.  I tell them, ""Look,  I can feel everything.  I can get up off this table and dance."".  I wiggled my legs for emphasis (you're not supposed to be able to move anything from your chest down with an epidural).  

So, the shocked anesthesiologist said we'd have to try a spinal.  His floored that I can move my legs and kinda aghast.  As he leaves to go get the spinal stuff my body starts to tremble.  My mind is perfectly clear, the nurses ask if I'm cold and start covering me in warm blankets.  I say, ""No.  I'm not cold.  My body remembers and is trembling from fear of memory.""  I say all of this in a very calm voice.  The nurses kind of collectively frown and just add more blankets.  One of them \*tells me\* I'm cold.  lol  No.  I did not feel cold.  I also didn't \*feel\* scared.  It was like, muscle memory for my body, like, my skin and muscles were terrified for me and I kept trying to calm them down because, so long as my heart was beating, I was never going to allow them to cut me while I felt it again.  Ever.  So, I felt calm, inside my head, while my body trembled.  It was ,weird. 

Anyway,  he comes back, and what do you know?  It works!  YAY!  I'm numb, can't feel a thing, they hurry scurry to cut me open because spinals don't last as long as epidurals.  I remind myself to \*remember\* what happens after they take baby away.  So, out baby comes no pain, plus baby, I so wish I could hold her.  My heart is happy and it hurts all at once.  I *yearn* for my baby.  I tell my husband to go be with our baby as they take her away from my face (how I love her) . 

&#x200B;

I'm only allowed to have one person in the operating room with me.  I am left with no familiar face to look at as they start to roughly clean me out and stitch me up.  I am trapped inside my own body as they forcefully yank those stitches tight (pulls my body a bit off the table).  I'm staring at the ceiling, I have no escape.  And it dawns on me. 

""I do not want to be here.  I'm not going to stay."" (*so that's what  I did!*)

So I left. Deliberately, on purpose (this time).   Like, I closed my eyes and mentally checked out.  I have no memory of being stitched up beyond the first few yanks because, I, on purpose chose to, what? Turn off my brain?  Live inside my imagination?  What happens?  I dunno.  I \*on purpose\* utilized a self-defense mechanism I was previously unaware of.  That's crazy!

&#x200B;

As it turns out, I've done this for \*years\*.  Forget the traumatic.  Learned it when I was little, you know, while be sodomized and forced to watch in front of a mirror, with folks recording it and everything.  Who wants to be there?  What a horrifying memory to unwrap.  Lucky me my brain separated my emotions from the cognizant memories.  I experiences the emotions first, the visual memories, those came later, separately.  It's like watching a movie, and it was easier to imagine it wasn't me \*because\* of the mirror.  I could see from an outsider's perspective.  These memories are strangely hazy, they remind me of trying to remember what I did when I was drunk or high.  I'm pretty sure I was drugged, it was the pain of sodomy that woke me up with brilliant white pain. It was so much more and worse that I can articulate.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It wasn't just once.  I was trained.  They taught me breath control.  Forced me to learn it.  Like, brainwashed me?  I don't know.  I feel freaking crazy talking about it.  I ask my mom what happened the year my dad says I started, ""walking funny for a while"" (they're divorced).  She won't answer me.  She says, ""It's too painful for me to try to remember much less discuss.""  My dad seems clueless, but he's a convicted pedophile.   I don't remember him ever molesting me, and he wasn't convicted of that either.  He got in trouble for touching a tweenage boy.  I remember playing with that kid when I was like 6 and 8.  My dad went to prison when I was 8, two weeks before he and I were to leave the country together to meet my family in Venezuela.  I don't want to think I escaped whatever training I was undergoing because he went to prison.  It doesn't match up with my memories of him, but then, I do remember him taking to me bars.  He'd teach me colors from the bar stool.  I remember, I don't know.  Maybe it was a priest, he's Roman Catholic.  I spent every other weekend with him between the ages of 4 and 8.  I have a habit of forgetting trauma. 

I guess I'm most afraid of the unknown.  Or rather, the forgotten. That reminds me of a Veggietales song.  When they told the story of Esther.  

""I need not be afraid.  I will not run and hide. For there is nothing I can't do when God is by my side""

Even so, putting fear to death is taxing.  It's making recovering from this back injury excessively difficult because I keep failing to follow through with exercises that keep triggering these crazy memories and emotions.  I kinda wanna scream, but I can't.  It's 3am and everyone is sleeping.  Maybe I should go to bed too.  

I keep writing poetry.  I'll copy and paste from my phone journal below. \[to the redditors, My healing is in my faith, I haven't mentioned it much in my memory writings because I wasn't really dependent on God in that time of my life.  I am now\]

When all my might evaporates,

Searing hot pain overtakes.

No matter my fight nor my struggle,

Crying out caused more trouble.

Weightless weightless are my words

Float away, I am a bird

I am nothing,  cease to  resist

Taken they, my will to exist.

Drugged, subdued, forced to see

Delirium, your ecstasy.

Delighted he, in my pain.

Used, abused, taken away.

Hurt, defiled, I'm not here .Learn to love your lusty leer.

Dark like you, I do become. Crave the filth, make me cum.

Let's get wasted, let's get numb! Pretend to feel, can't out run.

Aware am I, my tarry pit. Sunk too deep, death imminent.

Taken again! Forced once more. Rage fills me up, becomes my core.

I, a flame. You blew me out. Christ, my embers, be no doubt.

Holy Spirit fan to flame,Holy oil, never tamed.

Holy He, came after me. Spoke to me through tragedy.

Holy Father hear my plea. Forgive me Lord, make me clean.

Heal me Brother, make me new.Holy white, just like You.

Take this pain, my shame, my rage. I cannot keep them in this cage.

I am empty, bereaved, incomplete. Broken, shattered, earth dust heep

""I am nothing!"". Dust and tears. Dark nothingness, many years.

Holy Spirit, hear my prayer. Heal me, cleanse me, in His care.

He gently soothes And heals all wounds Builds me up, makes me new.

Held together with God glue.

Built in Him, a new creation. In Him I'm clean! Jubilation!

Strength in He, in Christ I'm bound Holy Father, in Him I am found.

Holy Spirit guide me still. Holy Word, expose God's will.

May I be bold, may I give.May I be righteous, in Jesus live.

Be my fuel, may I burn brightly. Take not my, salvation lightly.

Spread the joy, share Your smile.Tell the world I am Your child.

Fierce and pure, Christ-assured.

She engulfed in Holy fire. Singing, dancing Holy choir.

Burning brightly star bridge power. In His time, in His hour.

I'm a bridge, a holy lane. Traveled by, those in pain.

Hear me Father. Hear my cry, help me mourn those who've died.

Holy seed, planted be, in their need, now set free.

Soft the soil of their hearts. Turn to mud what once was hard.

Holy Spirit help us pray.Softened, sifted, finest gray.

Burn away unholy dross.Light the fire, darkness lost.

Pure white sand from ashes sifted. Purified in waters gifted.

Healed in Christ, His holy blood. Mixed with dust, holy mud.

Clay made new, fired bright. Firm in Christ, filled by light.

Perfect kiln makes me shine.God shaped vessel, ultra fine.

In His love. His conduit.For Him I'm made. In Him, I fit.

Blind by sin, even still. Trusting always in His Will.

Be me bridge from pain to light. Healing bright lit pain in site.

Soothed, renewed. We go once more .Round and round. Evermore.

Beautiful dance do I display.For You my Father, hip hip hurray!""

edit: hmmm, when I copied and pasted the poem from my phone journal into here it, the formatting did not stick.  I might fix it later.

edit2:  also, (haven't gone to sleep yet), my husband says I have this weird scar right over my tail bone.  According to my mother I've never had surgery there.  It looks just like a surgery scar (aside from the c-sections I've also had other surgeries, the scar on my tail bone is very like the one under my belly button from when they took my gallbladder).  Part of me says the puzzle is coming together, and it's something I shy away from seeing.  Most healthy folks don't \*want\* to see carnage, emotional or otherwise. God in me says I can handle anything through Christ who strengthens me.  He never said it would be fun or easy.

I am thankful for the truth creeping up on me.  Adult me would cease if all the despair childhood me felt landed on me all at once.  It'd be like an atomic emotional bomb.  It's like, bubbles sticking to the inside of a glass of soda.  PT exercises tap the memory glass, bubbles fizzle to the surface.  I never know what form they will take."
"Someday you will tell me you don't love me anymore, and I will tell you that I understand. 

Every day it feels like you nestle a little further into my heart. You grow a little deeper, are a little bit more intricately woven into my life. Everyone I have ever loved or trusted this much has left so I can't imagine an outcome where you stay. I stop myself from pulling away from this, from us, because not to experience this thoroughly would be a travesty. To not dive deeply into this love would be one of the greatest regrets of my life. 

Even when I can see clearly how devastating losing you will be I hold myself open, I will myself to be brave. I will not let you go until you ask me to. I will love you as if I can imagine a future where you love me tomorrow as much as you love me today. 

I am so grateful to have met you, to be loved by you, and supported by you. I never believed that someone would see value and beauty in me when I struggle to find value or beauty in myself."
"So I've finished my 3rd semester of college with good grades and decent spirits. I was able to find a job and work during my time off, barely covered car repairs and christmas presents. My grandma made it through surgery and is on track for 6 months of chemo. Her husband sadly became ill and had to have surgery as well. Unfortunately there was issues with healing so he's had to have a chest tube in for multiple weeks. Christmas was great, I was spoiled by my mom and step dad, with a kitchen aid mixer and duvet. My bio dad even gave us real presents this year instead of checks that bounced, lol. (I do Love him though.) Still single, but happy. "
"Today was my dad's birthday, only one day after his little sister passed away from liver cancer. His favourite sister, and the third family member we lost in the span of a year. 

I'm trying my best to be there for him but I'm falling apart myself. My friends have to deal with a lot of random  panic attacks so I feel guilty as fuck.

I found out a couple of things that helped me make a decision, but also hurt my feelings. Oh well, I have an answer now.

Also, I finally have a pain clinic appointment tomorrow so I really hope that it will go well."
"I noticed early on she was different for a baby. Everyone kept telling me she is just really smart, might even be a genius, but there were tells that I noticed that spoke of something more.

Lately her mother and I have been working sign language into her learning because I have mute moments and they are pretty frequent. While her mother has been drilling in simple things like 'eat' and 'more' I have been teaching her more because she has picked it up really well and I know she is capable of learning more than my brother and his wife realize.

This child, this one year old child, has decided that we can speak with our hands and has made her own signs now. One. The child was born in September of last year and is already making up her own language.

She gets frequent 'headaches' and leaves the busy part of the house to tuck in a corner. Pretty sure she is experiencing sensory overload (because I do too) and when she needs a break from loud noises and busyness she looks at the person she feels most comfortable with at that point and gently pats her head before tucking away in the dining room between her toy box and the China cabinet.

With this being a very busy holiday and with my family having been tested and self isolating in order to have this holiday together it got loud at my brother's house and the little one padded over to me (I am proud to say I am one of her most favorite people) and nudged me, gave her head that gentle little pat, then went to tuck herself away.

I was sitting nearby, within her line of sight, and she made a distressed face, pat her head, and crouched down. I asked my brother what the new sign meant and he brushed it off as her sign for headache. He did get everyone to quiet down and after a few minutes she rejoined the group in the den.

Over the past few weeks she has been cutting new teeth so I noticed she made a sign for pain as well. She holds her right ear and tilts her head a bit while pouting. That one I was able to translate easier. She had been in a lot of pain lately so she kept doing it until she was given some medicine to help with her teeth.

The third sign I have noticed is a little more alarming. She yanks her left ear and screams. Any time she's angry about something she does this and she is a little hot head just like the rest of us so any time something does not suit her she does this.

It is concerning because her ears are pierced and I fear she will hurt herself by ripping the earring out.

So the minute she acts out I kneel and talk to her in a soothing tone until she calms down. I am almost positive she is autistic and tonight my brother finally brought it up as well. He mentioned he thought she might be autistic and I confirmed it was a high possibility. There are a lot of signs she is displaying that made even him, dense as he is about children, believe she is autistic.

Well; at the mere mention she might be different our cousin (reformed drug addict, now holier than thou) burst out she was going to claim with God that nothing was wrong with the baby and we should not speak more about it or it would come true.

My mom and I tried to argue that there is nothing wrong with being autistic, but she just got really loud and started saying she claimed it and that meant it would not happen and I motioned at the baby as she pat her head and tucked away again so mom let it be.

I suspected she was either autistic or something the day after she was born. It is hard to explain. I took a look at this little human in my arms and just felt it. It helps to know that it runs in the family on my grandfather's side and mom suspects I'm on the spectrum myself is likely how I picked up on it so quickly. And how I know how to handle her better than her parents do.

But for my cousin to make such a racket about there being something wrong with autistic people, and even snap at me saying I'm not on the spectrum because she claimed it, is beyond ridiculous. It felt like a slap to the face.

However finally everyone got to see her act out. Usually she just gaslight's me and almost drove me to suicide when I was at my lowest. Finally they got to see a glimpse of the unhinged behavior I had been dealing with all alone, so that made me feel better. Now they will believe me when I say she is driving me low again.

So mom pulled me aside when we got home and we talked about things and she told me to keep doing what I have been doing to keep her calm and content while she is at my house and mom is going to have a sit down with her parents and have them treat her differently going forward.

I would not say they are terrible parents, they just are not used to raising a child. And this one is different with special needs.

All we can do is our best and hope it is good enough."
"My journaling and intuitive messages come in the form of poems and for me they are very healing. I wanted to share them here to see if they resonate with anyone else.

&#x200B;

I am scared

I have been in fear

Allowing it to be in me

All of this year

&#x200B;

Fear of shining

Fear of truth

Fear of letting you love me

Fear of letting myself love you

&#x200B;

I’ve been trying

To keep myself safe

Staying in

This primal state

&#x200B;

Aiming for

Comfortability

A stable home

Somewhere to be free

&#x200B;

Am I shaky

Like a wobbly foal

A new year comes

We stand

And go

&#x200B;

Arise so quickly

Tumble

Roll and fall

Whinny words of victory

&#x200B;

Even when standing

At a questionable turn

You don’t have to be stable

To move on through life

&#x200B;

We all stumble blindly

Seeking the light

Imperfection

Is the common theme

&#x200B;

A life of love

And always healing

"So, I finished middle school.


I don't deserve the diploma. 

I've had depression for the past 2 years. I never knew I had depression until this year. My depression has caused me to fail my classes.

This year I had over 20 missing assignments.

Yet I passed."
"So, right now it's 12:26 am when I am typing this. My dad was playing with the kittens right outside my room when I went to go use the bathroom. 

5 minutes later I'm walking back to my room and I see my dad trapping both of the kittens underneath a small clear plastic container. 

I am not making this shit up.

I immediately get angry and ask him what he his doing. He laughs and says that they know how to get out. I look back at the cats and see that they are slightly struggling. 

I then ask if they are getting air. My did misheard me and said that they can get out. I ask my question louder, and he says ""Oh. n-no."" Then he lifts the container and lets them out.

To be more specific about the container it is something [like this one](https://www.amazon.com/Sterilite-Quart-Stacking-Closet-Storage/dp/B00HM81R2I). It is big enough to fit both of them in it, but small enough to have them squished up against each other.

I really don't want to start a fight but, I'm telling this to my sister first thing when I wake up.

(5:30 pm) Update: I told my sister about it at 10pm but surprisingly she didn't freak out about it at all. I also told my mom. 

Now, just a few minutes ago my dad went to play with the cats again. I saw him go for the plastic container and I asked him if he was planning to put them under there again. He laughed and said ""They like it, no?"" And I said no. 

I don't get how nobody thinks that it's wrong to purposefully put two cats under a container."
"Is this abuse?

Was it abuse?


I don’t know how to feel about my parents, mostly my mom. Was it really abuse? So here’s my document I’ve been working on trying to remember the awful shit. My dad has made some mistakes too but I was able to forgive him easily. I’m trying to process all this and idrk what to make of it all but it hurts and it’s really difficult when I have to be around her for work every couple weeks. Any thoughts would be appreciated 

Shit mom did in roughly chronological order

My mom used to blow up at me out of nowhere for reasons I was unable to discern- assumed malicious intentions on my part when I had none, and would make up a reason to be mad at me. We could be happily chatting away without a care, and then out of nowhere she would change. At least a few times a month, as far back as I can remember 

She Instilled in me a deep sense that I am “messed up” somehow (I think starting around 5 or so?) Constantly correcting, in a panic, making it clear I was embarrassing her, any even slightly unusual mannerisms (like bouncing my leg or playing with my hair, difficulty making eye contact, etc). Made it clear she was VERY anxious about anything that would make me seem different. She was frantic about this throughout my childhood. Took me to lots of different classes and specialists, switched me to a private school after I got treated like shit by public school teachers, but also refused to let me be ‘labeled.’ (I now believe I might have aspergers or something like that) I learned to feel keenly, at every moment, that I am fucked up and wrong and embarrassing, and different than how I should be.

Yelled A LOT, with little or no provocation. Everyone in my house did when I was little.

Absolutely spanked me as a little kid, with belts and with “the whacker,” enough that I was terrified of it and still have vivid memories of how it felt, but denies ever doing so- and if she did, she claims it wasn’t much! Just a little tap once in a while! I know this is pretty normal for kids my generation and older, but it’s the denial that gets me

Continued to slap, push, or manhandle me occasionally up through my teens. I rationalized that it wasn’t a big deal because it wasn’t often at all and I was never detectably injured

Dad also had anger issues for a while and would fly into rages, though very rarely. He would act violently and intimidate us (yelling, stomping, slamming doors, driving recklessly). However, he apologized to me with sincere remorse each time (I can’t remember a single time my mom has sincerely apologized for anything. The most she’ll do is make a big show of how awful she feels so we’ll feel bad and rush to comfort her and reassure her she’s a wonderful mother), and he was always kind, empathetic, and supportive to me throughout my childhood, and still to this day. He was always there for me when I was hurting, listening and helping me work out my problems. When I was 13ish we had one particularly bad incident when he was fighting with my mom and I tried to interfere and he threw me across a room; after that, he left the house for a couple weeks, got medication, and never lost control again. I often wonder what kind of trauma he might be dealing with too.

When my brothers tormented me for fun- I don’t hold it against them, I was the oldest and they were all little kids- neither parent ever did anything to stop it or teach them it was wrong unless I was actually injured. I was always told to just ignore them. My brothers would make fun of me and put me down for all kinds of reasons, push my boundaries, annoy me for fun, chase me and push me or bite me, stand outside the door and loudly mock me while I was using the bathroom, chase me with A KNIFE, mock my body, and so on. They thought my reactions were really funny.

She used to cook things that she already well knew I would be unable to make myself eat over and over (onions, most meat, weird chunks, etc- when I try, I gag), yet every time would still huff and guilt and make me feel like an evil bitch for not eating it. 

Actually, she definitely called me a bitch a few times. Also maybe not that big a deal but it still didn’t feel great. She normally never cursed but would make exceptions during a fight

Emphasized to me I should be grateful because she was a walk in the park compared to her parents

BUT Allowed her father and later his wife to be viciously authoritarian toward my brothers and I and had no problem leaving us with them. I would try to defend my brothers and then ended up getting the brunt of it.

Talking back was the greatest sin with my mom and always made things worse for me, and yet I never quite learned not to

Hours upon hours of homework torture each night because I was unable to make myself focus and answer simple questions. Often I would sit down to homework and crack jokes, tell stories, talk and ask questions about topics that interested me, sing songs, anything but the problems on the page. Soon she would lose patience with me, and it turned into hours of alternately screaming, or crying, slaps, or agonized silence trying so hard to read the words on the page but only being able to think of other things. This night repeated hundreds of times from ages 7-13 or so. Then starting in high school, the supervised homework sessions ended, and I was expected to do it on my own (I never got the hang of this).

Constantly commented on and criticized my body and appearance, especially weight, as well as CONSTANTLY berating her own appearance and weight and dieting/exercising obsessively, including often outright- and very conspicuously-refusing to eat (we look a lot alike). I was thin and took no pleasure in eating until 14 or so

Emotionally absent a lot- staring at laptop, smiling, oblivious to us (she was, of course, cheating). The typical scenario: i would be talking to her about something, she kept silently typing and staring at her keyboard, obviously ignoring me, and then a few too many seconds after I finished speaking, she would look up: “What?” It became a meme among the siblings, she did it to all of us for years. The particular guy she was cheating with turned out to be a cultist, and then the obsession for the next few years became connecting with other people on forums for those with loved ones in cults. 

Had inappropriate, in depth conversations with me about her sexual/romantic relationship (or lack thereof) with my father, and weighing whether she would at some point want to divorce, from when I was in elementary school. Including seriously badmouthing him (He is asexual, as I guessed in high school, but he had no idea that was even a thing and just thought something was terribly wrong with him that he must overcome).

Vented to me, as early as elementary school, about tons of inappropriate adult stuff like that- her EXTENSIVE drama with friends and family, her disillusionment with her father for living with a woman out of wedlock (lol), school politics and business of other students that I should never have known about as a student, world and personal tragedies

Basically made me her therapist every day on the car ride home. These rides were also a prime time for her to suddenly turn nasty and scream at me for no reason I could ever find 

Seemed weirdly jealous of my positive relationship w my dad and once or twice made disgusting insinuations

When I was 12 or so, told me a few times that I would someday need plastic surgery to fix my ‘protruding’ muzzle area

When I told her at 12 that when I walked alone, I got honked at, she treated this like something exciting and fun and sexy

Once removed my door for a couple weeks when I was twelve or thirteen 

After hearing about my inappropriate sexual experiences at 13, encouraged me to make my best effort to get back with the guy who did it. Similarly groomed me to court and highly prize male attention 

Told me at 14 I looked pregnant after I gained the first tiny bit of fat I had ever had on my body in my life- as is completely normal for a pubescent girl. Made sure I knew she kept a close monitor on my weight

When I asked how she would feel if one of my brothers turned out to be gay, said she would not want them to be gay because it makes life so much harder. I struggled to accept my bisexuality for many years 

Never even attempted to accept my atheism; still asks me periodically if I’m a Christian again yet (as recently as this month). Which puts me into a position that forces me to be the bad guy because I have to tell her ‘no’ and break my poor mother’s heart again

Put me on Atkins at 14 and a couple other diet/exercise fads in subsequent years

Teased me about my developing breasts at least once, making me very self conscious

Told me a number of times that I should not pursue a career in music (the field she and my dad work in) because it’s so hard and emotionally taxing for little reward; has idolized and praised a certain brother’s musical talent and prospects from day one 

Weirdly competitive, often mentioning how she is ‘smaller than me’ for instance

Likes to brag a lot about my siblings without mentioning me

Was able to either demonize or idolize people depending on whether she was angry at them or someone else. So, the person she was angry at was completely devalued, and everyone else was an angel.

Has pushed hard for me to get a doctorate even though school has been hell for me and it’ll be a damn miracle if I even get my masters

Undercurrent of passive aggressive, plausibly deniable insults every time we interact continues to this day

Once in high school, I spent some time painstakingly drawing a realistic profile of her. I proudly presented it to her and her only reaction was disgust because of her double chin

At 15 or so, I accidentally saw a text on her phone from someone (not my dad and not the cultist) calling her ‘Bb’ and saying he wanted to ‘worship her whole body’ (JESUS CHRIST PUKE. SCARRED FOR LIFE). That was one of the most earth-shattering, soul-rending moments of my life. I was devastated and even tried to fix the relationship myself, advising my dad to do something romantic for her, and admonishing my mom.

Once around 16 or so I was taking too long in the shower and making my parents late for church. They could have simply left me behind (i always hated church anyway). Instead, my mother barged into the shower, violently scrubbed my body herself, dragged me out of the shower and  roughly dried and dressed me herself, and pretty much pushed and manhandled me all the way to the car. I think there have been other times like this but it’s hard to remember 

Blames ME for our sparse contact after her moving out. Apparently I need to go way out of my way to make all of the initiative in our relationship even though I’m agoraphobic and avoidant and can’t drive. Never mind that I HAVE made several efforts, but still I get blamed.

Sometimes seems to have given up on me actually doing anything with my life and already think of me as a failure

Angry at me for being unenthusiastic about her relationship with an abusive halfwit imbecile 

Thinks I should just get over the dissolution of our family by now

Constantly pressures me to drive/get a legit job"
"It's a shame that our relationship ended due to circumstance. There's really no way we could make this work though, our paths in life are just too different right now. Today I saw you though, and for a while it felt like things were normal. It has been 2 months since we broke up. I still think about you. Before I saw you today I was honestly mad at you. It seemed like you were rubbing your life in my face. That you didn't really care about me anymore, but I can see now that you still care. Honestly wish you were mad at me so I could justify not liking you but that's not how I want things to end up. I have to keep reminding myself that you were your own person before me and will be the same after me. But it's still so hard to be friends with you because I'm still in love with you. I still feel the hug on my body you gave to me today like sweet poison. Draw me in and lull me with those eyes. Kiss me and tell me it's going to be okay. I want to savor your love and be held by you. There were other women after we broke up, but they don't even come close to giving me my fix. You're the only one I want, but life has split us up. How is it that I've met the one but I can't be with her? Why did you invite me to your place when you said you needed space? What was that wink? Do you miss me? Have you forgotten why you broke up with me in the first place? I don't care, just hold me. Wrap me in your arms and let's forget about the world. The heart break is worth it."
"\- I am not special to her  
\- She does not contact me out of her own wish   
\- She stopped contacting with me for 1.5 week. It was hell for me.   
\- I thought in this quarantine; I will make a piece of heaven here with her. Living together. But alas. That was not the case.    
\- I completed one full cycle. Meaning, I fell for her. I allowed myself to let her in. I became vulnerable. Strength - Weakness. Strength - Vulnerable. In order to feel we need to risk getting hurt. We became too needy. We lost sight of ourselves. We suffered. We wrote poems about her. We noticed that we became too soft, too comfortable. We started Twitch to battle loneliness. We stood up.   
\- I was not enough for her to let go of her Australian boyfriend and risk choosing me."
"Dear Diary

Well, it was gonna happen sooner or later.  I now have a family member who's been infected with the Covid19 virus.  My uncle, who is 76, was taken from his supported living group home to the hospital for a high fever, and was diagnosed with it.

I feel like such a shit because I want him to not survive this.  It's not because he's a jerk.  No, he's as unjerkish as a person could be.  He used to be a very intelligent vibrant man, and Alzheimer's got him.  He runs around now like a little kid and honestly sometimes it's hard to distinguish him from my mentally handicapped daughter.  I hate seeing him like this, and I just want him to be free.  

Do you want to know why I don't believe in god at the end of the day?  My uncle is a deeply religious man, a faithful servant if you will.  Why would someone inflict this on their faithful?  Don't give me that bullshit answer of ""god moves in mysterious ways"". That's just a crappy way of saying ""I don't know why god would shit on us.""  

I just want him to be free.  One of the most brilliant people I've ever known is reduced to... what he's become.  It's not fair."
" Been  to my psychologist's office for a session. She's awesome - I send her  my work routine every week and she does her best to find us a time to  meet.

I'm a drug addict who is  recovering. I am a recovering. drug addict. Seeing someone relapse is  probably one of the most painful experiences I had to go through today.

Usually  she doesn't have to bash the truth in my face head-first but today I  guess, on this subject, I needed it. Usually I'm far clearer.

Apparently  I don't believe I deserve love. Because I've been so blessed with  literally every other aspect of my life, I don't believe I deserve any  more good. And I feel wounded, ashamed, a creature, an alien, when it  comes to the need for a relationship and love - and I reflect those  feelings upon the people I meet whom actually do have the potential to  be my partners. I see weakness is a fault to be ashamed of, when I am  weak myself in several ways.

I  didn't work out today because I'm a little sick, but by Saturday I  should be back on track. I wanna talk to my sponsor, but it's late. I  gotta go to sleep and wake up at like 5 am tomorrow for work. I love my  job.

I try to be honest, and I  want people to read what I write. Most likely we're all here for our own  self-centered reasons, and nobody is going to read this. I have this  fantasy though, that someone will, and that someone will relate.

Lemme tell you this though: My dick is on the small side of the scale.

I'm grateful as fuck. I am clean just for today; a year, six months, and ten days.

God, if you exist, and if you're on Reddit too, then please just keep me on the path I'm on right now.

Hugs to all, even yall who got them Coronavirus shits crawling up their bods."
"Today I didn't manage to study. I am afraid I might fail my exam and lose my chance at the scholarship. 
I don't even know what to say. Right now my life is pretty decent, I think this will be my best times and in the future it will get worse. 
I still am suicidal."
"My mother had two seizures today.

Almost six years ago her brain was bleeding. Last month, they found out it was leaking again. Last week, they did surgery to close it up.

I hadn't seen her since she was in the hospital. Here I am again, sitting in a hospital room next to my sleeping, drugged up mother.

There's a lot going on with the situation. She's going be alright, but they're not even sure what caused it.

I just want it all to be over. I'm tired of hospital visits and watching my mother struggle like this. She honestly deserves better. She's the toughest, wisest person I've ever met and she really deserves better."
"This past Wednesday, the worst thing ever in my entire fucking life happened. I returned home, after a day of walking, to discover one of our dogs dead in the backyard. She was a rat terrier chihuahua mix, and we have had rat problems for a while. She was always hunting for them. And there's this plastic drainage pipe we use during rainy seasons to keep water from flooding our basement. She had stuck her head into the pipe, all the way up to her shoulders.... And got stuck. It was a very tight fit, and she couldnt breathe or cry for help. I knew immediately something was wrong. I rushed inside to get my stepmom, who was busy working in her office. We rushed back outside,and started pulling her from the pipe. We had hoped she was only unconscious. As soon as we pulled her head free, and saw her lifeless eyes... We were overcome with shock and grief. My stepmom began screaming, and carried her inside and began cpr hoping it wasnt too late. But it was. I was outside crying for over an hour. And the two days since this happened, I have felt dead inside. I feel like this is a nightmare that I'm going to wake up from. I don't want to accept the reality that our sweet little girl is gone.

EDIT: tfw you don't even title your post on your own subreddit properly. 😖"
"Sometimes I do. Toxic, sweet soul poison."
"Long time lurker, first time poster here :D

 Things kinda just feel like they've been going downhill lately and I'm having mixed feelings about it, mostly ""meh"". I have no real reason to be why I am, like its been almost 2 months since I bought myself my first new car, I recently got a raise so that helps out with my payments. I've also started my 2nd semester of classes at my local community college, but I'm just not happy. Its almost as if when one great thing happens, two negative ones come running on up. Some pickled twig of a teenager decided to throw a water bottle at the car I mentioned before after he nearly ran into me and after I laid on my horn and flashed my highs at him for a bit. I've started to fall behind in my normal non-college (hs) classes to the point where I am nearly a month behind in most subjects. It also seems that every friendship I start ends up ending because of something I did, like either its I said something that needed to be said, or (the most recent situation that sparked this post) me ending up being too.... clingy (i guess you could put it like that) because I really enjoy talking and being around said person because they make me feel like this stuff that I'm going through feel temporary. Like it's gotten to the point where said person physically tries to get away from me. Idk, I'm sorry for the rant and the long post, if this belongs on another sub, let me know. Thanks to everyone here and the great community that you've built."
"I think you know what I mean. 

It’s a little overwhelming to confess that I’m an idiot. Not in a funny way and not in a sad way. In the most neutral and factual way, I’m a dumb person. 

Even in my college years, I still wonder why I get A’s. The class must have been easy or the professor must have felt bad for me. That’s always my thought process. I do my best to get the A’s and yet I still feel like I don’t deserve them in the end. Is it true or is that just a self esteem issue?. 

I’ve always known I wasn’t so bright. 

Ask me to do a math problem out the top of my head and watch me fail. 

Give me pop-quizes related on history and laugh  while I struggle. 

I always knew I wasn’t smart. 

You won’t ever get to show off where I’ve studied, because it’s a no-name university. And who cares about that, right?. 

You won’t get to casually mention my career, because I’m not in medicine or law and anything else is just not impressive enough, is this correct?. 

Have you ever asked yourself. Who cares?. Nobody really cares. Why do people insist on making different life achievements a competition?. Or is that just the stupid in me coping?. 

I know I don’t care. I don’t choose my goals based on what’ll make me look best. I just can’t achieve goals that are made for more intelligent people and that’s okay. So I set achievable ones that might just look really funny to the people who like to look down on others “beneath them”. 
You know what I hope for those people?. Peace and a good life. To never feel the weight of loved one as they look beneath their shoe and on to you and smirk as they’re doing it.  

I know I’m not smart and I never will be. I won’t get to answer all those math quizzes right and I can live with that. It’s not the end of the world. 
For my life, I just want to be stable and be fulfilled. Most of all, I wan’t peace. 

Life is very pretty when you stop judging people, especially for their intelligence. 

Everyone does what they can. 

Let’s let people be happy doing the things that may seem little and useless to some, but big for them. 

Good Night


"
"On July 22nd, in the year of our Lord two thousand and seventeenth, this reckless, fast-spinning insignificant blue speck of dusk in the endless universe made it’s 30th revolution around the Sun in regards to my existence.

In a lot of ways, not much has changed.

I’m about the same height as I have been for a while (though a disgruntled physician debated fervently with yours truly for 30 min, determined to convince me that I have managed somehow to acquire 2 more inches of my already superfluous height), I feel about as energetic as I did in my 20s, I don’t look much different (even got rid of that god awful excuse for a beard I carried around for a little while), my thoughts are about the same, my pleasures, annoyances, points of view...
Waking up on my 30th birthday felt like just another normal day.
Among all  the usual hub bub that surrounds one when their birthday arrives were the usual messages from my friends and loved ones, wishing me the usual happy birthdays, repetitive shout outs to the so called “dirty thirties,” and warm words of encouragement. Constant reminders of how enjoyable this part of my life will be. Jovial certainty that there is a bright future ahead of me.

Why did it all sound like dehydrated dog shit being thrown at a rusty gong?

The obvious reasons immediately came to mind. “You should be a lot further ahead in life than you are now, you’re still single with no children, you need to pursue goals to settle down for the long term, you don’t find any sort of fulfillment in your current activities, you should deal with your deep rooted anger and depression more...” Yada yada yada. Well, no shit Sherlock, I can give myself at least enough credit that in 30 years of life I can at least identify problems.

Congratulations.  Gold fucking star.

As I trudged through the humid New Orleans air and the thickening downpour of rain that flooded the streets with (...well...I hesitate to call it “water”), combined with a lovely scent of shame and bad decisions rising up from the sewers, the environment seemed to reflect how I felt about being 30. Same shit, different storm, and all I’m left with in the end is the repugnant smell and aftertaste of the past.

It is now December, 6 months later.

That horrible taste is still on my tongue. I still have my bad days with depression. I continue to have moments when a distasteful memory resurfaces and I feel like nothing will make me feel better unless I punch a baby in the face (with the sole intent of giving the precious little bastard crippling brain damage). I still sustain the absolutely ridiculous notion that my former partner isn’t every bit as horrible as they have proven themselves to be (which at this point, I feel I can firmly rationalize that away as pure self preservation). However, there are three very key factors in this grand equation that have changed:

1. I am doing better. Not great, still, but much better.

2. Hope for humanity is a child’s fantasy, not to be used in practical life situations.

3. Quite frankly, I just don’t give a flying fuck anymore.

Now, the first point is important. Progress is significant. I’m in a much better place than I was a year ago. My substance use has all but vanished. I feel sharp as a tack. I’m writing music every day. I work hard and earn good money. I’ve surrounded myself with a higher caliber of people. In the general, yet very shallow, kaleidoscope of how one should live life as an adult as others see fit, there are few disappointments.

The second point I’m less enthusiastic about. It is absolutely foolish given the type of person that I am to hold on to such idealistic self righteousness as “people are inherently good, people will do the right thing if only they are given a chance” rhetoric. It is dogmatic bullshit that only the clinically insane and the religious humans among our species buy into. People are selfish, people are self righteous, and they would rather win a fucking argument to stroke their pathetic ego because it’s the only thing that holds their insignificant existence together than to critically think about anything. It’s easier to feel than to think, and let’s face it folks, we don’t exactly live in a fucking society that discourages acting on feels. #deep

Nonetheless, there is a certain melancholy and a slightly tearful adieu associated with accepting that level of pessimism of others.

The third point...not giving a fuck...is fucking glorious.

Not being shackled down by the worry of hurting someone else’s feelings. The freedom to speak your mind without fear. To do as you see fit for your life. It’s absolutely exhilarating. And as such, that is what I embrace most about this new decade of life I’m embarking on. Not giving a fuck if what I have going on is inconvenient for others. Not being afraid to pursue my own answers, my own dreams, how I feel my life should be lived. Not concerned with what others may or may not disapprove of. To be all of who I am, for better or for worse, to correct wrongdoings as I see fit, and to stubbornly tell you to go fuck a rusty vacuum cleaner right in the rotary blades if I am determined that this is the best course of action for me.

To shoulder consequences on my own.

Fuck your approval, fuck the smile on your face, fuck everything you or anyone has to say. This is MY time now, and after wasting years and years of being on someone else’s time, agenda, and goals for me, I’ve had enough. Now, it’s me first, and everything and everyone else second.

So, to anyone who may have raised a vaguely curious eyebrow to what I have to say, these are my tips on how to be the best goddamn 30 year old you possibly can be. Feel free to embrace or turn red in your face in fury over the following. As I may have mentioned before...I don’t care.

1. Always have a back up plan for anything you do.

2. Repeat rule 1.

3. Say what you think, and be impeccable with your words. Also, keep your fucking word when you give it. Nothing ruins an adult’s reputation more than a broken promise.

4. Never put yourself in a situation where someone has true power over you. (I’m speaking in terms of mental and ESPECIALLY emotional power.)

5. Whenever a millennial or someone younger and more inexperienced than you are says something you disagree with, just nod and smile. (I once had a young idiotic prick tell me that since I’m over the age of 25 and that my brain has fully developed, there was no chance of me ever changing. I wasted a day of my life and a lot of anger trying to explain to this little shit that the brain is a biological computer, capable of storing information and learning until death, and that a fully developed brain doesn’t mean it’s just stuck there. Me arguing somehow logically convinced him that he's right.) Granted, there are some original ideas that come from our younger generation, and I am never one to discredit a good idea, but, for the most part, arguing is seriously not worth it.

6. If you are lacking in motivation (as I find myself to be more often than I’d like to admit), get in the habit of doing something productive and mentally stimulating every single day. You no longer can afford the luxury of having days where you do absolutely nothing.

7. Presentation matters. Invest some money in clothes, makeup, shaving cream...all the things that will make you walk out the door looking like a fucking adult.

8. Lay off the fucking weed. Seriously. If you’re still toking up every day getting roasted before work, and everything else that you do in life, STOP. Again, appearance is important, and at this age, everyone you’ve been around has smoked a lot of reefer, and yes, you look like an overage stoner who is irresponsible. (Oh, just a fun fact, did you know smoking weed before your brain has fully developed in some trials have shown to speed up the course of the genetic marker for schizophrenia, and can impede certain types of brain function in later years? Seriously fuck that guy for making that argument. What an idiot.)

9. Just...ease up on the substances in general. Indulging is perfectly okay, but it’s no longer okay to go out binge drinking the night before work, or do a bunch of acid and go do paperwork, etc. Again, you can’t get away with it anymore. People do see it, no matter how fucking good you think you are at hiding it.

10. If you’re single at this point, just act like you’ll never date again. Either something will fall on your lap or it won’t. No one likes that 30 year who’s so desperate that they’ll do anything for human affection.

11. Take time to come home to yourself everyday. Being alone is so important when you have the time to do so. If you haven’t gotten a good hold of who you are by 30, you really do need sometime to yourself.

12. It’s time to accept that you have flaws that are not going to go away. Instead of crumbling to a pile of dust anytime they surface and fuck something up, learn to accept them and use them the best way you possibly can.

13. Hold yourself to a higher standard than you did before. 

14. Appreciate yourself, and what, how, and why you think a certain way. Hold yourself accountable.

15. Learn to be okay with being wrong, and adjust accordingly.

16. Knock off the fucking gossip.

17. Know for a fact that it is not too late for change. Never ever give up.

Sincerely,

Some guy with an opinion

"For a while, I wasn't sure if falling in love with someone you've never met is completely possible. But I learned the hard way that it is.   
Growing up, my parents always told me ""don't talk to strangers"" and ""don't talk to people online."" As I grew older, I listened to this less and less, and the majority of my friends were made online. I met a girl on Iconator back in the day when people would spend hours on that website searching for the perfect icon for your AIM. I still talk to her, and we have been friends since 2007.   
Years go by, and I meet more people online. They're more friendly, understanding, and more interesting than a lot of the people I know in real life. It's weird how you can go from strangers to friends within a few seconds with the technology we have these days.   
Stumbling upon some new websites a few years back, I meet Zach. We instantly became good friends to the point where we'd talk every night until 3am, even when we both had to get up for school the next morning. I talked to him more than I talked to my friends that I've known my whole life in real life. Somehow, we ended up deciding on webcaming together, and I'm not entirely what website we used, but we spent hours on it just talking about whatever we wanted. Seeing his face had turned into a daily thing, and when I didn't see him, my day was awful. Somewhere along the line, I think I fell in love with him.   
I didn't know how it was possible, considering the fact that I had never met him face to face and because he lives over 1,500+ miles away from me. His smile had lit up each one of my days, and my life was so much darker without it. I learned that when I had made one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I was on vacation, and I had given my number to a cute boy. Long story short, we ended up dating and I didn't know how hard Zach was going to take it.   
Apparently, he liked me a lot more than I thought he did. Two years, and he still hadn't spoken to me. He moved on, got a girlfriend, deleted me on Facebook, and stopped talking to me altogether. The cute boy I had given my number to and I broke up, and he had still wouldn't even acknowledge my existence.    
It's crazy how fast you can go from strangers, to friends, to strangers so quickly. In fact, it kind of scared the living shit out of me. I honestly thought I'd never talk to one of my best friends again. Somewhere along the lines, he messaged me again and everything around me stopped. I felt like a rug was ripped out from under my feet. We both had been through so much and had grown up. I missed the way things had been before. I missed talking to my best friend. I missed the feeling of being happy.   
Last night, I saw him on FaceTime for the first time in three and a half years. I don't think I've felt this happy since I first met him. I've missed him so much, and I remember what being in love feels like.   
""I'll wait for you.""   
""For how long?""   
""Forever."""
"So here it goes. I've been feeling alone lately.So I am in my first year of college, I finally decided to go to one of my friend's parties (let's call him Steve). Got drunk and loose and I had a lot of fun. Met some cool people, but then I started talking to some girls and it made me realize I miss a physical relationship. I met up with an old friend from high school that I've had a crush on for a while. I thought we were clicking and she mentioned that she has a thing going with some other guy but they just aren't official yet. I went over to a friend's house last night and Steve swung by too. I'm the last guy in our friend group who is still a virgin and I'm 19. He kept bagging on me so I got in my car and went home. Then he kept trying to call me and apologize but I ignored his phone calls. No girl. Not getting along with my friend. I'm going to Florida with a friend, but he also invited his girlfriend (another close friend of mine) so I'll be playing the part of third wheel. I just don't know how to feel about all of this or what to do about it to change it."
"I dont think i am desperate. I mean, the desire to meet someone who falls for you.. is it too much to ask for?

Idk, these thoughts constantly floating in my mind. All my friends are either dating or got engaged. And here I am.

I am not bad looking. I work in a decent company with a decent pay. Academically inclined throughout. 

Still can't understand what am I doing wrong."
"It's rather therapeutic. Today has been very tough - I had nightmares, persistent suicidal feelings and anxiety so severe I couldn't stop shaking. I'm not sure why this happened but I've never felt more alone. 

On the bright side, I'm on volume 2 of the Life is Strange comic book series and I'm absolutely loving it. It is providing closure to the game series. 

I have chores to do tomorrow that I'm not happy about but I'm not going to cancel or delay them. .

🌻"
"I’ve been struggling to keep myself sane these days. Maybe I’ve just been single for too long. All I can think about is boys. I went to the dentist today and he had his mask on, so I can’t really see his face, but his eyes were sparkly. I bet I was in the most unflattering angle I could ever be in, when I was sitting on that chair and he was inspecting through my mouth, I probably look ugly as hell to him. These are the times when I really wish I could look pretty. He kept probing around my mouth and I started drooling, as one does when they have their mouth forced open for too long. Then he took the little cotton balls and wiped my mouth and cheek, ever so gently. When he was wiping my cheek it almost felt like he was putting on makeup on me, he’s so gentle, I indulged in that feeling for as long as I could. 

Then the job was done, I was gonna leave and the receptionist said goodbye to me. Then he just so happen to walk behind the reception desk also, and he kinda squatted down a little and said goodbye, we made eye contact, he looks so cute. I also saw his face sideways when he took off his mask and his medical clothing, he’s a bit buffed, just the way I like it, and he’s just... so cute. I didn’t even have a clear look of his full face but this is enough for me to daydream about for the rest of the day."
"I got another result back from one of my vitals tests when I was at the hospital. It's in regards to my EKG, my heart's electrical activity. The report said I have a ""heart block"", which sounds worse on paper, but they explained to me it wasn't as bad as it sounds, at least in my case. Without getting into the medical jargon, it means my heart's rhythm and beat are slower than usual. That would probably explain the fatigue and slowness I've been experiencing. They told me that exposure to ""environmental insults"" can cause this, and if that's the case, it should go away within the coming months.

Also, the scarring that occurred in my lungs wasn't from fibrosis, at least in the severe case. It *is* fibrosis, but not the deadly kind. It was most likely caused from a condition I had temporarily developed called GERD, which is when acid in the stomach reaches up to the upper part of the esophagus. Constant GERD can inflame the lungs, and apparently--this is something I didn't know--the first signs of its symptoms are from the lungs and not the stomach or esophagus.

The heart and lungs are like connected twins. Whenever something happens to one, it affects the other. I'm just hoping this isn't going to be chronic. Oh, and my vision is returning to normal, at least it's much better, anyway. The sensitivity to light has been getting much better, so I can rule out having cataracts at a young age!

My sense of taste and smell are returning to me, and no, it's not from the virus. I already got tested four times now and all the results have been negative. The only thing that's bothering me is my hearing. I have an inner ear infection (otitis media) and I've been applying an antibiotic, per my doctor's orders, to both of my ears. There's a problem, however. Both of my ear canals are extremely narrow, and just to make it even more of a pain in the ass, they're inverted. 

Yeah, I hit the worst genetic lottery in terms of ears and got inverted ear canals, if you can believe it. My hearing isn't completely hampered, but it's annoying that I have to struggle to listen to someone speaking from across a room. I don't think the eardrops are working, because they can't get into my canals properly. I'm gonna have to take antibiotic pills probably.

I don't get to see my new PCP until late January, unfortunately. It's funny: I can see the specialists, but not the family doctor. It doesn't matter too much, but I would like to see this guy sooner than later. I don't have a choice, though, and it looks like I'm stuck waiting in the queue like everyone else. 

My throat's gotten dramatically better, along with my vocal chords. I don't have to worry about that anymore it seems.

A friend in the family got the virus, speaking of all of this. He's been a friend for along time now, and I'm hoping nothing happens to him. He's got the usual fever and muscle weakness like most patients, but I'm extremely concerned about the shortness of breath, if he should get it. He doesn't smoke and has a generally healthy background, as far as I know, so I'm sure he'll pull through. It also helps that his wife is a nurse who's been practicing for over 30 years now!

This year needs to die already. Honestly, though, the only thing that'll change is the number on the calendar. 2021 won't necessarily be better, not until we can actually see what'll happen. Still, it'll be a relief to get this beginning of the new decade out of the way for good. I'm sure historians will have a heyday writing about all of this.

When the vaccine becomes available, I'll most likely be one of the first people to acquire it, considering I work in a hospital. Of course, clinicians who've been on the frontline dealing with this thing will and should get priority for this. Honestly, I'll take anything at this point so we can be rid of this mask mandate finally.

I'll have to wait for the coming months to see if there'll be any improvement in my health, or, you know, worsening of. One of the doctors I work with said that ""words have power"", and that I should constantly tell myself that I'm going to get better and that nothing is wrong with me. But, of course, they also said ignorance of your health is a bad thing, so I should get checked out at the first sign of something off. Doesn't that kind of cancel each other out? Whatever, I'm not the one with a M.D.

I got work tomorrow, and it's gonna suck. Have a goodnight, everybody. Happy Holidays!"
"So, it's currently 6:12 AM. I don't know what's going on, but my mom called me a few mins ago and told me  to turn off the alarm on our home. I did that, then my dad called me and asked me if the police were there. I heard a knock. Idk if it might be the police. My mom also called me again during writing this post. She said that the alarm went off long enough that the police might of had to come. She told me to just stay in my room. I'm scared. I'll update this if anything happens.

(6:40 AM) Update: My dad is back home now. And everything is fine I guess.

(7:06 PM) Edit: Also, I’ve been wanting to say that my dad has been coming into my room to talk to me. Yesterday he came into my room and asked me to help him write an apology letter to my brother(19) I helped him a little bit. My dad has also been asking me how my brother is. I’ve been acting like he’s been at the house when my sister and I hangout, when he actually isn’t. I know my brother doesn’t want my dad to know about his girlfriend. Today though, I started to nervously laugh and I couldn’t control it. I hope my dad still buys my lies."
"Wtf is wrong with me anyway. I lost my fucking diary from my teenage years. Objectively speaking, I only write diary when I’m in a bad mood. But still, I documented my feelings from when my father passed away to the first time I talk back to my mother yelling at me and all my frustration and sorrow. 

Lately my memory is not that good. It feels like I am deliberately throwing the thing away to avoid processing my feeling. It’s so bad. Wtf is wrong with me. What am I supposed to do now. How am I supposed to know how I felt at that time. I can’t remember clearly and relying on my current memory would be biased. 

I feel like my feelings at the time didn’t really matter just because the “evidence” are gone. I hate myself so much. Help."
"Writing a journal everyday sometimes feels like a chore, but honestly I power through it because I really want to remember these moments in the future. Today there wasn’t really much that happened, I went out and got ice cream, I watched some Star Trek Voyager with my family, and I really am grinding out on CSR2. But that’s pretty much all for today, hopefully tomorrow is going to be a more eventful day. 
-Love always,
J."
" So,  here I am. Sitting. Gazing upon a rusted iron garage roof that flanks    an overgrown lush backyard, with buttercups sprouting, begging for the    dawn of spring. A winter evening shall be met with the oasis of quiet    solitude, as my eyes droop from a well earned drink that I place    half-finished on my bedside table. However, the view is partly hidden by    a red curtain and unwashed window framing the view of a recently    repaired fence, hiding the new neighbor who is building a new house.    Such vibrant activity, now drifting to sleep. The sun hides away, and    tucks it self in a bed of grey clouds.

Breathing    slows down, but my mind remains as active as if I were fresh out of    bed. Where is my life going? Music playing in the background hides me    from the confronting silence.

There is work to do, but in this moment I am not concerned about that.

This  morning I was met with praise and celebration from my team in a group    project. This gave me a sense of assurance that disrupted the hours of    slavery to my craft, my studies and my goals. I smiled, and went about    my day with hope that was soon interrupted by a chaotic kitchen,  where   no wooden spoon could be found for my pasta. Things declined  from  there.  If I only I just made a sandwich. Things could have been   different.

The  shops were closed   after the prime minister put us into lock down again,  except this time   the novelty is gone. There is no spark. There is no  fire. The candle   has burned down to its final drop. There is just a  sense of peace and   serenity, with a tinge of longing to feel something  more extreme just   like in my teenage years, where each day was an  adventure and every   moment I spent with friends was magical, like a real  life movie.

I   hear my brother  mutter angrily whenever I pass him with his laptop  sat  at the dining  room table, as I grab a bowl of food or a light  snack.  The hunger makes  work difficult, but fighting too hard to make  things  better is tiring.  So I begin to accept the mediocrity.  Perfection is on  holiday anyway.

Now   I am  confronted by adulthood. The magic has worn, and my casual  clothes   screams to any onlooker I have stopped caring. Careless and  free from   all worry. Well, at least that is how it looks.

I  still cling to the dreams of an amazing life where I have everything I    could have ever wanted, because apathy is unacceptable. Making it my    reality is a battle, but I am willing to fight.

No    need to go all out on the first battle, this is more of a war. A war   to  live for a reason, as opposed to aimlessly going about existence   like  each day is just another day. Wake up, go to work, come home and   sleep  and repeat.

I will fight   for my  freedom and will not stop no matter who and how many people try   and tell  me this is just the way things are. Just accept imperfection   they say.  How about no! I will not. That will be a defeat and I know I   am a  winner!

Now I look back at   my  backyard. The darkness has enveloped the grass, but my eyes can   salvage a  faint view of the clothing line where a symphony of cars   driving home  play a discordant clashing cord to conclude tonight   performance.

But the show aint   over til the fat lady sings. An encore of shouting from  my brother and   mother gives the audience more than they asked for.

Sweet Dreams."
"It's been a week here at my grandma's and even though initially i liked all the authority in the kitchen and loved trying my hands on cooking, it has become hectic lately. Every day i have to cook all the meals and clean some stuff too, no matter how i feel. I can't be sulking, depressed or just not in the mood. Guess that's what being an adult is all about. The show must go on.

And even though I'm only doing the basic things and not really studying significantly, i am exhausted by the end of the day. And all i want to do is get some sleep. It was hard getting sleep first because I wasn't contented with the way my day was spent. I wanted to paint and read my novel and record a song may be but I'm lacking the energy.

Also how hard it is to remember everything! I almost forgot my roomie's bday but made some vid montage just in time.
I want to be happy. And i want to feel happy.
I just typed that twice.
*Nervous laughter*
I really want to be.

I don't want to be validated. I don't want anybody knowing how much I've had to do a few days. 
Sometimes i wonder how hard everybody out there has it and I'm just a small speck in a universe of pain and suffering and abominable exhaustion. But then I'd love to have someone listen to me. And really listen and empathize. I don't want to be pitied. This is why i don't open up mostly. I've lost a lot of good friends and it's become increasingly difficult to trust and become my vulnerable self.

But then the other day my boyfriend said you aren't happy all the time because it's supposed to be like that.
Happiness is fleeting. I've stopped expecting much out of day and am focussing more on getting my jobs done.
It's not easy to live an ordinary life.

You live mundane days and try to carry out all the duties and be there for them and still feel empty for that one mistake you did or a person you wronged and you believe you deserve it.
I don't remember how many days I've spent this way. May be they had it harder. May be they've suffered more.
And may be, God willing, they're better now.
I'm waiting for my sunshine to show up. To feel relieved of this rock off of my chest. Yet i just can't see when it'll be enough.
Who suffers more? The perpetrator or the victim? Is perpetrators' agonizing their wrongdoings justified? Or is it us faking it again?
I want to be kind to the people around me. But i don't have the will to even smile back to a stranger some days because i feel they can see what a terrible person i am."
"The sun is out. The day is beautiful. Here I am, no enjoying. I feel like shit. I feel like a loser. Everybody is having fun. And, right now I am not happy with myself. I am not. Everything, well not everything, a lot of things are out of order. Sleeping schedule, workout routine, diet. They are out of order. The big three. We broke up few days back. My flatmate, my friend is moving out. I am here. I am stale while everybody is moving. My thesis is still there, have not touched it. It was all in chaos, then COVID-19 added some more chaos. I am not doing well."
"I’m not totally sure what I hope to get out of posting this everywhere. I get long winded and grammatically... creative when I’m high, so I understand if this is too much for most people to read. I just feel so alone in this and I want to understand, and to feel understood, and I’m sick of keeping it all inside. I’m sick of nobody knowing. I’m sick of feeling like I’m crazy or just being dramatic, but my own words come across as wildly unhinged to me. I want to feel secure that it really was awful and it really wasn’t my fault. 

Anyway, this is the story of the most traumatic relationship I’ve had, besides maybe my mother. I’ll call him “W.” Worse things have definitely happened in my life, but W was involved with me in one way or another for more than a decade. I’m forgetful as all hell and I’ve already forgotten a lot of this story, but for some reason now I feel I don’t want to forget any more. I’m so angry all the time and i just want to scream about it, but there isn’t really anyone irl I can talk to about this. I’m tired of obsessing and fuming and hurting because of it. I had a promising therapist for a few months earlier this year but corona fucked things up and I haven’t been able to get back in contact with her yet.

When I was 13, W seduced me, although my understanding of what was happening was dubious at best. I expressed discomfort with what he was doing, gently pushing his hand away from my crotch or breasts for example, but he kept trying and I stopped resisting, because I was in love and couldn’t bear to lose him. I’d had an INTENSE crush on him since the age of 11- lengthy journal entries and bad poetry and lots of brooding. Anyway the relationship became extremely sex focused. He was only a year older than me, but I couldn’t help but feel that something about it wasn’t quite right. To this day I never told a single soul, not even therapists, except my mother, who seemed unconcerned (quelle surprise), though goodness knows my best friend at the time, J, asked many times for details about the relationship, and later its end. Some part of me knew that she would have recognized it was kind of messed up. I worried she would judge me. After all, he fingered me and had me touch his dick on the godDAMN SCHOOL BUS!!! AT AGE 13!!!! 

He never even found the clitoris back then for all the hours he spent touching me.

...Except for one memorable occasion on which he seemed to touch it by chance (ALSO ON THE FUCLINH SCHOOL BUS); I didn’t know what the clitoris even was or why it felt so strange. I found the sensation horrifying and panicked immediately, pushing him away

But he was hot and cold; he didn’t spend much time with me at school until we had already been dating for a couple months, and he tended to ignore me when around his friends. I found myself frequently wracked with anxiety trying to guess what his true feelings and intentions were. I began cutting around that time, also influenced by my mother’s emotional abuse and enmeshment, and my parents’ fighting.

W enjoyed making me jealous on purpose (which for me is a special kind of self loathing anguished hell- less anger, more despair); once on a school trip at night, as we were sitting side by side, he shone his flashlight on M’s ass. I was shocked and upset and he laughed at my reaction. Then I laughed it off too; of course, he was just doing it to mess with me. That’s fine then, right? M developed dramatically very early and there wasn’t a single boy at the school who wasn’t into her. It was a few years before I was able to understand that her position was actually worse than mine. Feeling ugly and invisible and worthless, I was extremely envious as well as disgusted by the guys’ behavior, but most of all I hated myself and my body and felt I could never be good enough. He couldn’t possibly have known this, though... could he?

He tried to “take a break” at least once, but when saw I didn’t understand what that meant, he dropped the subject like a coward.

He promised he would stay with me forever and said he loved me many times (i was thirteen, of course I believed it), then after our most intimate night (he tried to eat me out and had me play with him until he came. I did not understand what an orgasm or sperm were and the experience was surreal. I believe now that he wanted me to give him a bj, as at the time he seemed to be expecting something before settling for a hj. But back then I had never even heard that such an act existed and would never have thought of it). After I went home that night (he didn’t bother to accompany me home- it was just me and his mother making occasional awkward small talk to punctuate the heavy silence), he bizarrely stopped talking to me for a week, refusing the couple of calls I tried to make, then broke up with me over the phone emotionlessly, even perhaps a bit annoyed with my tears, a week before my birthday, never bothering to give me any inkling as to why. 

He didn’t say a word to me for 3 or 4 years. I had thought that maybe he felt bad when he realized I didn’t exactly understand what we had been doing, and that was why he abandoned me. But apparently that little detail never troubled him, as years later he  told me the reason was that he was questioning his sexuality at the time. Meanwhile, at almost 27 I still feel anxious and try to put it off every single time I’m about to have sex with my partner, especially when he goes down on me. There’s this panic that bubbles up that’s so difficult to get past.

I can pretty easily forgive everything up to this point; W was only 14, and has since told me that he experienced abuse as a child. But unfortunately it only got worse instead of better as we grew up.

He popped back up in high school as a casual Facebook friend I would talk to occasionally, and that was fine. Then the Summer of my 17th birthday, he became one of a horde of boys/men who descended on me after my breakup with CD (another abandonment without a single word of explanation) left me vulnerable and eager to have any man’s attention with no thought of the cost to myself.

We delayed sex a bit because he was nervous, but before too long we entered a FWB situation with the explicit understanding it would never be more. I thought that this was okay for a while. However, being completely open to and accepting of all male sexual attention proved to be traumatic. Being used for sex with an absence of any emotion or commitment did nothing to benefit me and completely destroyed my already pitiful self esteem, though it gave me a certain terrifying high in the moment. I saw a quote to this effect, which perfectly summarizes my feelings: “When a man initiates a FWB relationship, he is telling you to your face that you are good enough to fuck, but not good enough for a relationship.”

 These encounters with him and others allowed me to convince myself that I could have value if a man wanted me, because I could not find self worth within, but they ultimately made me feel even more worthless. This pattern of behavior continued until I was 24. I was desperate to feel worth something and it was the only way I could see to do so. I even had a profile on adultfriendfinder. I experienced countless noncensensual acts with my various ‘dates’, including spitting, slapping, choking, too-rough painful penetration. Getting left for dead in a parking lot after being violated on a “date,” shambling the couple of miles home to find a locked door at 2 am, and the humiliation of being questioned by J and her mother about what had happened to me. Two different men raped me anally during these years and I was also orally gangbanged. There may easily still be existing photos or videos of me nude/performing sex acts, and I have no way of knowing if those have been shared or uploaded anywhere. These were damaging, terrifying and horrible experiences, but somehow I kept seeking out vulnerable situations with strangers. I might have done almost anything just to feel for a moment like I was wanted (I suspect this risk seeking compulsion is directly linked to- if not a result of- my mother’s emotional abuse. It also may be linked to my unexplained and sudden abandonment, first by W and three years later by CD).

He would go for months or sometimes even a year or two without so much as a word, usually going silent for a long time after we had sex, then show up expecting sex for literally nothing again. Some friend.

He expressed strange and empathy-deficient far right stances on things from time to time (although he bragged he was highly empathetic- funniest joke I’ve ever heard). I don’t remember any specific statements but there was one on Facebook that i found so disturbing that I muted his profile and stopped talking to him for a while (though he probably didn’t even notice). I think it might have been something antifeminist? 

At that time I was ashamed to be associated with him, which is just as well, since he never showed any indication to anyone other than the two of us that we were involved. I ended up forgetting these red flags when I began to dream about love with him again. I forgot them so thoroughly that I can no longer recall anything specific he said, except that he asked me once if it was okay with me that he is conservative. Now that I am learning self respect I realize that I’d rather be single forever than date anyone remotely right leaning, but at the time I was so infatuated with my fantasy of our love that I dismissed it as unimportant. 

At some point during this time period we both attended a reunion party for our class. He completely failed to acknowledge my existence, or even just glance at me once.

I convinced myself I was okay with a fwb relationship and was unable to admit to myself that that couldn’t be more wrong. Each new time he came back into my life, it seemed my old, deeply rooted feelings, now seemingly firmly embedded in my subconscious (dating back to age 11) were reignited and I had never been heartbroken at all, the abandonment was a lie, that everything was undone, that it was meant to be. What a classic, beautiful love story, the childhood sweethearts reunited, true soulmates.  Pure delusion, born of my desperation to be loved. 

However, I denied these feelings to myself completely, knowing that if he knew I wanted more, he would abandon me as he has done many times. These emotions were somewhat dormant until Winter ‘16/‘17, but the hope never died completely at any point. I now know I somehow chose him to project my fantasies of being truly loved upon, and this place in my heart was not actually earned by him at any point. To this day I am tormented by dreams/nightmares of him most nights in a week, and I always feel broken and miserable when I wake up, even more so when we have actually reconciled and are involved again in the dream than when we’re hostile and angry. They are comparable to my PTSD car wreck dreams.

After another long “cold” period when I apparently wasn’t needed, W contacted me that Winter ‘16/‘17 with a simple offer of the kind he has extended so many times. This time he wanted to fuck in a hotel, and said he thought of me because I am one of his more “open minded” female friends. I should have realized then that I am interchangeable with other women to him. 

I had a wonderful time and was swept away. He even used the word “romantic” at one point. I felt on cloud 9. He only had to make the tiniest gesture like that to keep me hopelessly addicted. He made enough of them that I was giddy. I now know that this is called “breadcrumbing.” I was only being used for sex/ego, but it felt like a whirlwind romance to me, at least when I wasn’t consumed with heart wrenching anxiety. 

On that very same night, WHILE WE WERE IN BED TOGETHER, he spoke quite openly to me about his sex life with C. This broke my heart and made me want to fucking die, was pure agony, and yet still I thought that I was unreasonable to feel that way. I tried my best to show no indication that I was bothered- that wouldn’t be very “cool girl” of me, after all. While we were leaving the hotel, he cracked a joke about my MOTHER joining in next time. This was disturbing enough to make me sick, but I put that, too, out of my mind, because it did not fit the narrative I wanted to believe so badly. I think there were other upsetting off color comments that I have since forgotten.


 In his usual fashion, he didn’t talk to me at all after our encounter for months. But in March, Breath of the Wild came out, and remembering our many conversations about our shared love of Zelda games, I initiated contact to talk about the game. This was probably my biggest mistake. 

It turned out he was happy to have long, in depth conversations with me almost every day. He dropped countless romantic breadcrumbs and I began to hope I was somehow special to him. The high I got from these breadcrumbs was beyond intoxicating and I became quite dependent on it.

 But he also loved to talk to me about his sex life with other people, in detail, even showing me pictures sometimes (including pictures of him actually in the act with someone). Showing me her pictures, he told me C was “his princess.” (is it really possible he didn’t realize how that cut me down to the core? Knowing he had some sort of actual feelings for her while simply using me for sex was a new level of torture. Is it really possible he had no idea how miserable and worthless that made me feel? I felt beneath even the goose shit on the sidewalk. Do I really believe he didn’t know?) He would sometimes nonchalantly taunt me by rubbing the weight of other women he was fucking  (less than 100 lbs) in my face- I have had a troubled and even torturous relationship with food and my weight since adolescence and I am sure he knew so. He even had the gall to ask me for RELATIONSHIP ADVICE about these other women.

 Each time I felt utterly crushed and worthless, I cried for hours every single time, and I even ended up cutting myself extensively on my breasts, stomach and legs despite barely any self harm in years. My body dysmorphia was dialed up to eleven and I had detailed, visceral fantasies about sawing off huge parts of my body. It would never have occurred to me then that the problem was not me, but him.

This devolved into an insane mindfuck cycle of breadcrumbs, withdrawal, torment (in any order), which served to create a powerful trauma bond. The only thing that soothed that emotional pain was the breadcrumbing, and I became horribly dependent on those breadcrumbs of affection, hints that we could someday be more, even living for them. Meanwhile, my despair at the other parts of the mindfuck cycle was boundless and unbearable, and I became increasingly suicidal.

The one and only time I dared to hint that he was making me feel jealous, his response was a cheeky “maybe that’s the point.”

I thought it would be more evolved of me to force myself to accept him fucking other girls as I fuck other guys, to not wish for commitment but just enjoy what we had. I told myself my pain would go away as I got used to this, and my ideas about love were old fashioned, and I could surely be happy this way once I became accustomed to it. When this was difficult I blamed myself, feeling I was broken and regressive for being unable to separate sex from emotion.

 But though I wouldn’t admit it to myself because I was determined to believe that I was okay with our emotionally detached arrangement, the secret heart of me believed that if I was good enough to him, he would fall in love with me and want to have a real relationship. Though I did not admit it consciously, this was the driving force behind everything. So I told myself if I was bothered by him talking about fucking other girls the problem was with me, not him. My goal was to be his perfect dreamgirl. I would accept everything and be infinitely sweet and infinitely accommodating, doing anything and everything to support and pleasure him, showing myself beyond any doubt to be his true soulmate. And secretly even from myself, I dreamed of the day he would realize it. 

The stakes got higher. The breadcrumbing seemed to ramp up into full blown future faking, with just the right amount of ambiguity to give me hope while still allowing him to avoid accountability. He sometimes talked about how his ultimate taboo fantasy was settling down, impregnating his woman, white picket fence. How he was starting to think more about what really mattered in life. He referred to me as “his girl” on that kink website. He told me I had his “luv.” Many more examples. These things gave me hope and kept me invested in my efforts.

He several times hyped me up for our ‘appointments’ and then stood me up at the last minute, leaving me to cry in front of the pizza man in my beautiful dress, hair and makeup that I spent 2-3 hours on. The amount of pain on these occasions was quite intense. The feelings of being insignificant and not good enough would intensify x100

I began to feel a strong desire to tell him I loved him, but I also strongly felt that I could not do so because he would definitely abandon me. This conflict caused extreme distress for months

During this time, I continued acting out sexually with many different partners in increasingly extreme ways, even including sex for pay. It is a miracle I never got an std. I believe the pain of my relationship with W led me to seek more and more attention to make me feel I was good enough and worth something and cover up the hurt. I think I also wanted to prove that I was sexy and desirable. I had many traumatic experiences then as is par for the course when I act out sexually, most especially several more nonconsensual acts (getting me high then raping me with fingers after I said I didn’t want anything to happen yet, forcing me to eat his ass with no prior consent, choking me so hard I thought he was going to kill me, and others) that happened during meetings with guys from OLD. Other men asked to lick my cuts or help me cut. My main “sugar daddy” relationship was even more damaging to the point I don’t want to write about it. I now realize that putting myself in these situations was another form of self harm.

We sexted very often, engaging in elaborate bdsm fantasies. He revealed himself to be a “dom” and was always working to make me into the perfect “sub.” He was obsessed with his harem fantasy which broke my heart, but I participated as whole-heartedly as I could because I wanted him to love me. He heavily fetishized my timidity, people pleasing, anxiety, and “innocent” demeanor- every trauma symptom. He loved to embarrass or fluster me and reveled in it frequently.

Eventually I told him a little about my trauma with other men in high school and college, including my anal rapes. He expressed regret at not being there to protect me and love me properly. He told me that he felt a strong obligation to stay by my side and take care of me. I now believe this was only manipulation

In January 2018 he told me he loved me (after sex, naturally). I was so shocked that I couldn’t manage to say anything, even though I really wanted to. I was indescribably happy. I tried to say “me too” but am not sure whether I was able to communicate what I meant, as I was a stammering, incoherent mess. I thought our relationship would change and my dreams would come true. I finally fully allowed myself to hope and admitted to myself that I was in love with him. There was still a part of me that felt that something was off, but I pushed it away because I wanted to be happy and I thought this would be a new leaf for our relationship.

On this very same night, he gifted me a HUGE (already... opened??!! What the hell) butt plug that could be remotely controlled. Only a month or two after I confided in him about my anal trauma. I put this out of my mind and gave him the full benefit of the doubt; surely he simply hadn’t realized how this might be insensitive, right? I tried very hard to train myself to take it, with dismal results. Still, I felt it was important that I try to do so, and I kept trying and trying despite my misery. I had to be his perfect dreamgirl, and then he would love me.

He let me know he would be coming back to town again in March, and many times hyped up how excited he was for it and how wonderful it would be (daddy’s coming home, get ready, it’s gonna be this and that and the other... blah blah blah lots of elaborate fantasies he spun for me). I was elated anticipating the first time we would have together after two and a half months. Our first time together after he had confessed his love. I got a special pin from Etsy to give him, a beautiful LoZ heart container enamel pin about an inch tall that matched the one I had. I wondered and fantasized about how it might be different than before and worked hard steeling myself to finally say “I love you” back. 

And then at last, after all the weeks of talking up he did, he was in town for 7 full days and didn’t bother to see me once. He had all kinds of excuses about how he had to spend time with his family. But surely if he really loved me, he could have taken a couple hours out of just one day in his week to see me. I realized then that his words and actions didn’t match; in truth I was FAR from a priority. I suspected he might have even been prioritizing fucking other girls first- he briefly mentioned something that hinted at this- and simply didn’t make it to me in the rotation. Once again I was heartbroken and sick to my stomach and I could not bear to speak to him for weeks. 

At the end of this time, I told him I was ready to talk again, and he was most contrite, apologizing and being very loving (though squirrelly about the actual word love, preferring to spell it “luv” for example). I was ready to let him back in. I even thought maybe he was beginning to understand my feelings. And then he began to tell me all about an Indian girl (why was her race the first thing he mentioned about her? Now that I think about it, he had also been weirdly fetishistic about my own race a couple of times) that he met on tinder and couldn’t wait to fuck. I think he noticed how my mood changed after that. The next day he said he thought maybe the Indian girl was from a dream, but by then I realized nothing had changed, nor would it ever, and that was it. There was no reason to keep myself trapped in this emotional hell. I finally stopped making excuses for him and gaslighting myself. I distanced myself, and have politely declined to meet again each time he has asked since.

However, I find myself increasingly consumed with fury as time passes. I never knew I could be this angry. I fantasize about telling him exactly how I feel, harshly, at length, and making him feel like shit. However, I know it’s probably better not to contact him at all. But I feel a strong compulsion to make him understand the pain he inflicted on me and make him feel remorse. I want him to realize how fucked up everything he did is. I can’t stop thinking about it every time distractions fall away."
"I don't remember where to begin. I feel like I never had control over my life. 

I've let external factors influence me to the level where I don't know what I want, what I enjoy, etc.

I don't have the necessary tools to succeed dealing with people, and fitting into society, and I've stopped believing change is possible. I don't think I'll get a friend/girlfriend/family. Everything seems to be empty to me.

I keep blaming how I was raised. How no emphasis on my will or how I was feeling was valid. Everything was ""what will people say"". How I am conditioned with that, and I don't even know what I want.

I'm afraid I'm going to be the worst ""loser"" out of everyone I have interacted with. 

I'm afraid I'm never going to get out of this hole I've been in since I was born. I don't know what I did to be here, but I realize I've dug it for myself. No one gives an actual shit, no matter what people say.

I'm afraid I' going to make this beautiful opportunity of existence into something overly shitty and pathetic.

I'm truly fucked."
"I think I will always blame my mother for my mistake. 

When I 18, I wanted to be a teacher. But I didn’t even tried to get into a college for becoming a teacher. I chose Business major in a foreign funded school that is 10 times more expensive than the average college in my country. 

I didn’t see a future in become a teacher. I hated the education system and the pay seems to be awful. 

Now three years later, I’m about to graduate from university and feel completely loss. I have no motivation and probably no mental health either. Every living moment feels like pain. 

After three years, I don’t want to find a high paying job or even a job in the field. I just want to find a job like working at a fast food chain because they will almost always hire you. 

Sometimes I think about how I should have chosen what I wanted. It’s kinda bullshit because this is what I wanted. Maybe it’s just my anxiety that’s preventing me from putting in effort. But I don’t feel happy. At all. 

I have one semester left. And I want to move out of the house as soon as possible. This does not feel like home at all. I feel like I’m living rent free, so dependent, so worthless. 

In this household, having small dreams seem to be the wrong kind of thinking. I feel like I have been pushed my whole life to be stuck in a mold. But at the same time, I feel like I have been neglected to the point that I never had a chance to grow mentally. 

I remembered the day my mother found out I chose to be a teacher in my career form, she acted as if I just ruined her life. That all her efforts to give me food and a roof over my head and to raise me was in vain because I wanted to become a teacher. Her only reason: teachers don’t make much money. 

I remembered when I was younger, a long time ago, my mother once asked me how much money I wanted to make when I grow up. I answered enough money and she asked how much is enough? To live by? Or to live comfortably? It got me thinking but I brushed it off. Not knowing that it’s just her projecting her thoughts onto me, because we weren’t well off back then, so money was always on her mind. 

I remembered at a young age, my mother and father would always say things like they working hard, trying to buy houses so that they can give to us when we are older, because my grandma gave them a house when they got married. I didn’t think much back then. But I never felt like those houses would be mine. I was kinda afraid also, just thinking of receiving a house from them. I didn’t know what I was afraid of back then.

Now I’m older, not much wiser but significantly more pessimistic of the future. I’m scared, so scared. 

I remembered when I was younger, so long ago, I used to love my mother so much, crying of the thought of someday I might lose her because a classmate lost their mother. 

I remembered the moment I think to myself, I don’t love my mother anymore and I was so afraid of that thought, it also feels like such a long time ago also. Sometimes I would find myself having thoughts like I would finally be free when she die and I feel disgusting for having those kind of thoughts.

I remembered watching Human Centipede 2 and feeling so scared that it would become my future. 

I remembered always wanted to be independent, when I was a child. Never did I thought that one day, the thoughts of being independent would come from fear and not just motivation itself. 

Everyday I think about how life would have been so much different if my dad didn’t die. I would have followed my dream because I know my father would try to convince my mother for me. And I would have the courage to do so because thoughts of financial insecurities would not be planted in my mother. 

Maybe I’m just having these thoughts because I’m overwhelmed with assignments. But I have been having these thoughts for so long now. I’m so scared. And so tired. I just want to cry every time I think of the future. I feel trapped. I have been feeling trapped for long now. And the worst part is that I don’t think I’m strong enough to break free. 

All I hope right now is to still have a roof over my head when I choose a job that is not what my mother want me to have. Not just a roof, I am more afraid of her words than anything. I talked back so many times in the past and now. But I know, it’s just to hide how afraid I am. There’s no escape and I’m so helpless."
"I'm feeling a little bit out of control. A little bit crazy. Like I might go poke the bear just to see if he's lazy.  I wanna be disruptive.  I wanna fucking shout.  I am not alright!  I wanna fight someone. Throw about.  I'm feeling kinda reckless. Like I wanna take my progress and throw it all away.  See what happens when I let go. Say, ""Fuck it."", and watch it fall away.

Reckless me wants it.  Reckless she, wants to see the world burn just to watch the color of the flames turn.  


Holy Father heal me!  Heal the she that wants travesty.  What is wrong with her?  She wants to see it all upside down.  See everything burn to the fucking ground.  No one saved her. She felt it all.  She felt her world burn, she never became No One at all.  She lives forgotten, silenced, subdued.  Raging muffled, unseen, buried too.  


She is pure rage and desire.   She lives in the orgasm, she glories in the red.  Mindless numbing ecstasy is her bed.  She is nothing, stripped of all. She has no power after all.  


I can't explain this destructive energy.  She living vibrantly inside me.  She wants to tear down all I've worked for.  She wants to live at my core.  She wants to feel alive again. For me to glorify her, forget the pen.   


She craves that burning pleasure. That which washes away all sense or logical measure.  She craves the chaos, the rage, the slow burn, struggling against the cage.  She wants nothing more than to be free. She won't be caged or chained. She screams. 


Holy Father shut her up!  Kill her! Smite her!  Fill my cup.   There is no room for her in me.  You fill me up, You set me free.  She is No One.  Silent rage. May she evaporate.  There is no cage.  Only God, may He be, the only One, living inside me.  


Holy Father lift me up.  Heal what's broken inside.  Quench the anger bright and thriving inside of me.  I've been blind to it of late. Unknowing my own hate. God help me let her go. I'm so afraid, of what I don't know."
"2/19/20 Looking for reasons as to why my girlfriend likes me, still can’t find answers

Even though the entirety of my past seems to suggest one result occurring, namely failure, an opposite trend seems to have emerged.

I’m relatively successful with women even though my past and all available data points to that being highly unlikely. Being about average in all stats, including intelligence, height, looks, and charisma, only truly standing out in a stat no one has really seen and isn’t factored into attraction anyway (penis size), I have to wonder if their is a data point about me I’m not considering.

My current girlfriend has had a crush on me for years without my knowledge, going as far as to tell her friends to help her get me, and even supposedly cried because she thought that I had no interest her. It preoccupies me as to why this would even be the case with me. She’ll never know this but I think she could do a lot better than me and that her “love” (I use that term loosely as not to be arrogant) is misplaced in a view of me that’s simply not reality. 

I do have somewhat of a craft for making people laugh, as is noted by many of my friends, but it’s not that fantastic. 

I thought maybe I was more handsome then I was lead to believe, so I asked a female friend how good looking her friends thought I was. Overwhelmingly was voted to either be average and below average, even ugly by a few. Unable to look at myself in the mirror for the rest of the day I tried to find other answers. 

Maybe I was just some sort of porn fetish for her. Overwhelmingly people from her country do not look at black porn, nor do they consume black media so that can’t be it. 

One of her gay male friends then got into a conversation with me, and the way she talked about me in private before we were even dating just confused me more than it revealed anything. 


She often called me a dork, said I was distracting, always complained about mistakes I made, always wanted to know where I was to avoid the area, called me a big kid, and she only ever said that I was funny. 

This information was somehow compiled into her liking me and admitting it to everyone before sending them to get me to date her. I’m sure she doesn’t even know why she “loves” me. I’m definitely not sure. This is totally new to me.

I hope that it continues. I don’t even know what’s causing it."
"So, my sister had another one of her ""explosions."" 

It was around 4:00 PM when I hear my sister yell ""I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE DAY YOU DIE!"" She was obviously yelling at my dad. She then goes back to her room, starts blasting music, and screaming along to the lyrics.

I'm just so tired of this. I feel like I'm suffocating when I think about having to live like this for the next 6 years. 

I also recorded a part of her screaming, so I can show it to my new therapist, so they can see what I have to live with."
"Sometimes I get suicidal and hate everything. Most of it is guilt, I've done things that are despicable. I've had motives that were thorns to goodness. These days I hate myself for it, but it's time to move on. I know what I did, I know who I was, I accept it. I don't want to die, I want to live. I want to live each moment in love. I burnt down much of what was, but there are still things in my life. For that, I am thankful."
"As a day, a year and a decade come to a close, I can’t help but think about what has happened over the last ten years. 

Moments and people that made me feel incredible.

But so many other occasions that were filled with pain and hurt, by the ones that I’d never thought would do that. 

Years in retrospect have gone by extremely fast, yet in the moment dragged on. 

I have hopes for the next year, and maybe the next decade. It’s too early to think long term, because I’ve always gotten burned that way. 

There’s some people I’d like to thank, and others I’d prefer who’d never come across my mind again.

My jumble of thoughts ends here for now. 

Talk to you next year, next decade."
"Dear Teddy,

I can't sleep. I'm curled in bed, my new teddy wrapped under one arm, and pillows all around me. I'm exhausted I can feel it in my body but I'm restless and I can't sleep.

It's a weird empty feeling. Maybe I deserve this for being a brat all day. Maybe I need to release some stress by other means. But really I just want a bed time story read to me and to be cuddled. I guess I'll count sheep until the thoughts in my head match the empty feelings inside.

Goodnight.

-Aces-"
"Dear Teddy,

(*my diary is addressed to my old teddy bear*)

See, I told you I'd be back!

I'm somewhere in between I should really be sleeping and well my tummy is full of cookies and I might want to watch a few more episodes on Netflix. It's been the kind of break where I've forgotten all the days of the week and even my work responsibilities  (I'll worry about work later though).

I haven't washed my hair in two days and didn't brush it all today. This unkempt look is so enjoyable- if no one else sees me. Speaking of which, I ran into an old friend at the grocery store while looking like a monster! 

The thoughts in my head:
*Should have brushed my hair! Just say ""Hi"" and quickly run. Actually, it was more like ""RUN"". Perhaps even slightly wishing my invisibility superpower would kick in*

I said ""Hi"" and continued walking quickly. He followed to catch up. You know, Teddy, it was actually enjoyable. We chatted for like ten minutes in aisle 10. We did quick checks on our old friends and how we've grown up already. Reflected on our success and failures and our future plans. He's headed into a promotion in two months. It's very exciting and I'm so completely happy for him! It's always so good to hear about the successes of people from highschool. You know there is so much people can talk about in ten minutes. Our chat ended with a hug and it was nice to not have my anxiety and appearance be such a factor in avoiding a friendly chat with an old time friend.

That's all for today. My tummy hurts, probably not that great of an idea to have had cookies before bed. 

Goodnight Teddy.

XOXO
-Aces-"
"I get the entire oncoming week off. Thank God. The boss was kind enough to let us all go and enjoy Christmas (and other holidays) with our family. Still, I will be on-call in case anything should happen at the lab that needs my or anyone else's immediate attention.

This is kind of an early entry for me, but I wanted to write it in now just so I wouldn't forget later. I might as well, considering I have nothing to do on this sleepy Sunday night. 

It's my brother's and sister's birthday today. I gave them their presents and wished them all the best. My brother is especially attached to me. He loves me and aspires to become like me. He doesn't want to become a scientist, no, but he said I'm a ""wicked smart and successful guy"". Yeah, right. I barely made it this far. If only he knew the full story of me getting to this point in my life.

There isn't much else I want to talk about. There was the whole brouhaha going on down in Washington right now, but I really don't want to talk about it because I'm getting sick of it. In any case, we'll see how it plays out.

Speaking of getting sick, I'm still pretty sick myself. I had a viral infection that got me laryngitis, a nasty case of it. I'm okay now but the remnants of it are still lingering. 

So, yeah. Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and goodnight to everyone!"
"Dear Diary

So I've been thinking a lot about the Bad Place recently.  No, not that bad place, but the one that exists in the world of *The Good Place*.  A show I totally adore and am anxiously waiting for the last couple of episodes to drop and see how this story ends.  

Spoilers ahead.  Stop reading if you don't wanna know what's going on with this story.

No, really.  Stop reading if you don't want to be spoiled.

Okay, I'm serious.

Last chance.

So in the story, in the first season, they think they're in the good place.  But when you pay attention you see that they're really being tortured in the bad place. But instead of your fire and brimstone torture. the demons are using the humans to torture each other.  And that makes sense, because we are really good at torturing people.  I'm not talking about the supposed study where they partitioned off two groups, one to be inmates and one to be guards, and the guards were brutal to them.  No, it's just really easy for us to torture our fellow humans on our paths of life.  I am consistently amazed at how shitty people can be to each other.  I am also consistently amazed at how good people can be with each other.  I'm not sure where the scale rests, but I like to think it tips closer to the being good to each other than the opposite.  But I digress.

So, yeah. I think about the bad place, and the eternal damnation that comes with it.  I don't see the point of eternal torture.  I *really* don't understand how your actions for a few decades can dictate eternity.  It would be like determining what career a baby is gonna have in it's first half nanosecond of life.  (I could do a whole nother entry on that, being born with with 'wrong' skin color which essentially dictates the same)   

I'm pretty smart, and I pick up things and make intuitive leaps fairly easy... but that one boggles me. 

I mean, at some point, you're gonna say ""The bear with four heads?  What else you got?""  ""Oh, boiling me in cow's urine again?  Okay, I'm bored.""  You get used to things.  Things get predictable, and with that predictability you just seem to be able to handle things.  Sure, being boiled in cow's urine sucks, but hey!  Been there done that.  T-shirt and all that.  

And that's where I am today.  The depression has been going in earnest for 11 months now.  And ongoing probably since birth.  So I may be sitting here thinking about dropping the 'N' in NSSI and I may wonder why I have to deal with this mess that is my life, but I'm also thinking yeah, it's just another day, a week before xmas (don't get me started on that) and oh yeah, I'm actually feeling not that bad.  

What else you got, depression?  Cuz while all this crap is going on, it's still just a Tuesday for me."
"It's been 65 days since I had confirmation of my husband's affair. I feel like it's just floating by. Sometimes days at a time stretch on like they take an eternity. Then I find myself 65 days past, and wonder where the time went. I'm just riding the waves at this point, waiting for the water to calm. 

My counselor tells me it's okay to not be okay with things yet. It's so early. ""Don't you think it's a little too early to be talking forgiveness?"" Yes, I suppose. Given that his affair was 1 1/2 years long, to be given forgiveness at 2 months probably is too early. But the toll it's taking on me is high. I can't stand staying at this level of uncertainty for much longer, I feel like I'm going to burst. I'm just looking for a few good days of some peace for a change. 

Striking a balance between protecting myself and my marriage is so hard. This is the hardest thing I've ever dealt with in my life. This is a heavy existence I'm living at the moment. I just want a moment to breathe. When will I get that?"
"It's grey out this morning. Thick overcast and wet, the roads look melancholy and asleep; the scenery is boring and underwhelming. Yet, I know there is a world of vibrant color hiding behind the facade, waiting to sparkle to life when the sun peaks through.

Just like with people.

The 'ordinary' and 'average' people, a homogenous grey crowd that passes by, zombified, the polar opposite of the 'fun' and 'extraordinary' vibrant people on Instagram - this facade is bullshit.

Because a stranger passes by and for once, I take a real look into their eyes - there is color and immense energy behind it."
"I've switched to using fountain and dip pens almost exclusively, and now I understand why they were so precious to people in the past. They are beautiful writing instruments, and using converters instead of cartridges means a whole new level of flexibility in terms of ink. I've two right now, a third on the way and a list of others that I want. Plus inks.

It is way easier on the hands.

And dip pens? I've been having issues with the ink I bought so I made my own from coffee. I need to get very cheap coffee and make some more. Grounds work well, just have to put through a sieve. I love the sepia color. So nice to work with. I just need to get a way to make it a tad thicker, and learn how to use dip pens better. My handwriting is not among the beautiful."
"***1/1/19***

Lachlan died. I can’t process it right now. All I know is that I need to write about it. I don’t know how to feel.

***4/1/19***

I  don’t feel anything right now, I think I have cried all my emotions out  now. It hasn’t really sunk in that he’s gone but it doesn’t feel like  he’s here either. I feel deflated, no energy or motivation. I don’t want  to do anything. His funeral is coming up either Thursday or Friday. Jas  is going to come with me which is nice, ill need her there. I don’t  know what to expect at this funeral. I’m nowhere near ready for it.

I  wonder where his soul is right now. I have always felt scared of the  thought of death and where you go after you die, but I don’t feel scared  anymore. Because wherever that is or whatever happens, Lachlan has done  it. If he is brave enough too then so am I. When I die I hope to meet  with his soul again. It’s not over with us yet, it can’t be.

***12/1/19***

Lachlan  I’m angry, so fucking angry at you. You stepped out in front of that  ambulance with your arms up. Fuck you Lachlan. You had to leave all of  us here without you. You should’ve seen how many people came to your  funeral, you touched so many people. I’m listening to the song that was  played at your funeral “It's called; Freefall” by Rainbow Kitten  Surprise. When this played we all stood up in remembrance for you. My  stomach felt like it had been punched, it hurt. As I stood there looking  around at everyone it felt like it finally sunk in that you were  forever gone from this world. I don’t know who I hate more, you or  myself. I should’ve told you that I loved you. I should’ve told you that  you changed my life more than you ever could have known. You inspire  me, you make me want to go out and live my life as full as I ever could.  You make me want to get out of my comfort zone, to meet new people and  connect with them on a deeper level. Life is too short not to, you  taught me that.

I know ill love  again, just never in the way I loved you. I haven’t figured out whether  that is a good or bad thing. I’d like to think that’s it good. Nothing  can ever replace what we had, how you made me feel, nothing could. You  certainly are one of a kind. Fuck am I lucky to have had you in my life,  so fucking lucky. Thank you for being yourself and not caring what  people thought of you. You are amazing, I really should’ve told you that  more. I hung out with your mates for two days, I really like them. Hope  I can hang out with them more, obviously it would be even better if you  could hang out with us too.

I  hope to meet you in another life. I wouldn’t waste a second chance with  you, not again, you will be forever young Lachlan. You will live in my  memories til my mind is no longer. Be safe Lachlan."
"Bad news, unfortunately. I went in for an onsite interview and didn't get the job. Bah, I don't want to go into details, but it's mostly because I didn't have the experience they were looking for. Me being unhappy when they told me they didn't want to continue the interview and they didn't want their scientists to ""waste their time"" on me, was an understatement, to say the least. They asked me about my previous spat with my last job and, well, unfortunately the interview sussed me out that I wasn't happy there because of the toxic work environment. You're never supposed to give so much detail about your past workplace to the interviewer unless it's in a positive light. The reason is because, as I've said before, it paints a bad picture of *you*, not your previous employer. Basically they thought I was lying to them, which isn't true.

They probably thought I was a fire-starter and that I couldn't be trusted. Ugh, this is such a pain in the ass. But, fortunately, something good did come out of it. The head of human resources told me she would help me in making connections for possible positions outside of their company. So, all in all, it wasn't a total loss for me.

I'm so exasperated in this job hunting bullshit. I was screaming and smacking my hands on the steering wheel of my car when I got out the building. After all the applications, this was the only job in a *long* time that I received an onsite interview...and now that opportunity is gone forever. 

I'm so angry at myself and the world right now. I'm just gonna take a break from this job hunting shit and maybe look into other careers. Maybe, I don't know. I feel lost right now and I'm afraid of going anywhere at this point. I'm so sick of this ballroom dancing of making connections, talking with people and then having them give me a runaround with no promises for landing a secure position. One guy told me to ""just go back to school for a better education."" With what money, asshole?

I've been doing nothing but picking and scratching at my skin all day in frustration. I want to scream and tear something right now."
"My sister got married yesterday. 

Finally, ten years of looking for a guy for her and it's done. The whole event was tiring and emotionally draining. I stayed awake for nearly two days going through the ceremonies and managing everything that was my responsibility. By the end of it, I was sleeping while standing on my two legs. Then I had to travel back and now I have to travel again tomorrow to attend a post wedding event thrown by the groom's side. I think once this is over, I will sit down with a bottle of whiskey and drown my sorrows. 

I know my sister has a new family now and that's the way of the world. Sisters and daughters go to other families, but I miss her already. So much. She's a piece of my heart and she's been a partner in crime through so much bullshit we went through. I feel like someone has chopped off a part of my soul here. 

But she is happy in her new family and her new home. The guy she got married to is too nice and that's my only consolation. I hope he loves and cares for her even more than I did. 

&#x200B;

I can't help but be sad about it though. Maybe I'll feel better in a year or ten."
"Loneliness becomes sentient, something to sit with. 

I'm oversharing to be heard. What does an inmate 25 to life care Mary Oliver died? In my latest letter, line-drawn birds in flight across the page. ""Know I'm here if you need"" inked in blue. 'If you need' crossed out... Know I'm here. I tell him too much, he has leverage over me now. I've given him everything he needs to hurt me—what does an address matter. I live on the page, he's already at my front door. 

Why do I keep turning to Facebook? Late night post poorly disguised yelling into the void, really. No one gives a fuck, but I'm numb. I'm scared and very alone, and this is left to me. So this is okay, I think. Releases don't need validation.

Boogie's new album is out. These days I hardly sleep nights, so what else is there to do but listen? I feel it, feel similarly. It's nice.

"Today I put my hair up in a messy mom bun. I could not find a pencil, pen, chop stick, skewer, allen wrench, paint brush, hair stick, etc.  


But I find in the junk drawer an old broken tooth brush, the head snapped off.  The handle is dual tones purple. Clear dark plastic purple and rubbery dusty purple streaked handle, nearly resembling a hair stick.  It even has some nice subtle curves to it.

I put my hair up with a broken tooth brush today. 

I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it either.

Edit one sentence and typos"
"Dear you, 

I received surprisingly good news from someone who I'll admit I was completely surprise it was coming from them. If it was anybody else I would be happy but definitely not surprised. Anyways it was good news for her and our group of friends but before I could finish enjoying the good news I received terrible news. A friend is missing. They have not been seen in weeks. A friend I haven't seen in a while but still a friend who I will never wish for something like this to happen to them. I don't know what to do or what to think. I hope they are ok and get home safe. I feel useless and scared. You always hear it in the news but it is completely different when it's someone you know. I want to fight but who? I don't know. "
"I don't understand why it ended. Was it my fault for not going to your party in 5th grade? You know how much I struggled as a shy, quiet, and sweaty kid. I guess I thought you'd understand... 5th grade, we were officially best friends. I never knew what that was like, so I was more than thrilled that somebody wanted to consider ME their best friend. At the end of the year, my theory is that your stupid party threw us off, and we never got back on track. In 6th grade, sure we still talked, but I'd never see you the same again, considering how you decided to simply throw me away. When I asked if we were still friends, you replied something about how if I didn't want to be your friend, I didn't have to be. You kept walking with your new popular friends, as I stayed back, and vowed to never associate myself with you ever again. I felt sick to my stomach. I could never truly get away from you, as we both had the same main group of friends. I hated every second of having to pretend to like you. Thankfully, our other friends made life a little more bearable, especially when you weren't around. Of course the one day everyone turned on you, I was there. Once again, I allowed you to step on me. Thankfully, our friends got over their grudges, and came back to you. I never felt comfortable with you, and the thought that you might not remember ever hurting me, makes me feel so gross. I'm thankful that we went to separate high schools, but I still often think about you and what could've been. I wish you never thought you were better than me. It's been awhile since I've last heard of you, but I still hope you're doing alright... Maybe some day we can have some closure..."
"Hi everyone! Hope you're all doing alright.

To be honest this is my first time ever using Reddit but I plan to use this page to help get things off of my chest. Hope we can all get along. ♡"
"Listen, It’s like bug heaven in the house.  The ants have formed a whole group just to ruin my life.  Any where I turn they’re there. No amount of that boric acid is stopping them. I’m not sure where to go from here. I need a good Lon frost to come and immobilize them. It’s like the damn militia. 

Hi, to anyone out there reading.  I know I seem finicky and crazy. But I’m a nice person. Hopefully that’s all that matters 

My new glasses are taking a bit to get used to. I guess I’m used to my eyes working hard. Just like every other part of my life in general.  

I’ve got that Benny blanco song on repeat. Going skydiving with E tomorrow. I can’t believe he planned that. Its right up my alley.  I still have my shaved my head yet. I think I will in oct to celebrate. 

How is life this bearable? I thought when I finally stopped liking K, that the world would collapse. I guess seeing how someone truly is can change that. He’s nothing like the guy I liked all those years. He’s cold and mean and rude. I kept trying to see something good in him. That’s my fault. I’ve accepted my role in everything. I didn’t have to let him do this. He needs a weak woman. One he can manipulate.  I played that role but now I hate the both of us for allowing that to happen. 

I promise to never again down play my strengths. Any man that’s secure with himself wouldn’t want me to do that anyway. D commented about how happy I am lately. That’s all I want is peace. 

Speaking of E, what does a smart, kind, no child, financially secure, gorgeous, secure person want with me?  That’s how my mind has turned. He must want something, RIGHT? My therapist tells me it’ll take a while for me to get used to being treated like a human again. And not an animal. I’ll give it time. 

House hunting online is soooo hard. 
Hopefully going to crab carrot cake today. Seriously.

"I have to call myself out on something. I think a big part of me was hoping that my spouse would end up wanting to be *a woman* because then I wouldn't have to be queer. Like part of me had it in my head that us being gay was just a phase, just transitional, and eventually s/he'd come through also and we'd both be finished and she'd be The Woman and I'd be The Man and we'd be normal again. 

And that's nothing to do with my actual attraction because yes I like women but I also *love* men. It's internalized homophobia, plain and simple. I love men, but being a man with a wife who is a woman is simpler and safer than being a man with a spouse who's sometimes a man and sometimes kind of a woman. 

The weird thing about growing up gay and trans is that I internalized homophobia without consciously realizing I was a guy (just knowing I wanted to be) and so it not making any kind of logical sense. I was ""a girl"" and so I was ""supposed to"" like and date boys, but I always felt really ashamed and embarrassed about it. Like I always had this sense I would get in trouble somehow for dating boys, or that by liking boys I was doing something taboo. 

And even now as an adult. Before I came out to myself I used to fantasize about me and my spouse being ""gender-swapped"" and would always paint us that way, with me as ""the guy"" and him as ""the girl"" and so when I actually transitioned it just felt sort of inevitable that he would eventually as well. Not that this was entirely coming from me-- she *has* said all the things that made me think she was transfeminine (and she is, kind of, inasmuch as an AMAB genderfluid person can be said to be transfeminine). But I just had this sense of like ""Ok ok ok keep going until we're normal again."" 

Because being gay *is* hard. For me (not speaking about anyone else's experience) it's not as hard as being trans, but it is hard. I feel awkward revealing that I have a husband when I've passed as male. It's all tied in together also, because I worry that people will hear ""husband"" and think ""oh that's a woman"" instead of ""oh he's gay."" 

But what I'm coming back to now is knowing well, y'know, I am a MLM if not 100% gay and my spouse feels comforted and validated by me saying I prefer men.  "
"I waited weeks for today just so we could get to spend some time together. It was everything I was hoping for. But I need more of you. My heart is hurting like crazy longing for you already, and I don't know when I'll get to see you again. I feel like I've been broken into a million pieces, and don't know what to do anymore. I need to see you again soon."
"I won't let you get to me. I am taking the high road. I have been journalling most of our fights in a notebook because I want to remember the details. 

After all that is said and done, why do I still feel sad? Why do I feel like my heart is broken even though I haven't loved in you in forever? Maybe because deep down I wanted to believe that you weren't so bad of a person. Maybe I believed all of the apologizes and the tears you shed. You fooled me. You keep fooling me because I am a helpless idiot who wanted nothing more than this relationship to work.

But you need to understand that all of this did not end because of me. You did not value me. I was just there. You thought because you had me that you no longer had to work to maintain me and this relationship. I expressed over and over how I needed you to show me that you loved me. I needed you to care for my feelings. I needed you to keep every promise that you made. But you did none of these. You value yourself more than anything. I know you will be sad whenever the thought of me not being there settles on you. Just like I know that you will keep busy to fill the void and ignore was is going on. But I know, for  fact, one day you will cry like a helpless fool. I know you will try to guilt me into feeling something for you once again. But you must understand, that you brought this upon yourself. I have been patient, and tolerant, understand, forgiving, and everything else that you needed. But you didn't care. You did your wrong. You apologized. You vowed to never do it again. Yet here we are. 

I don't care if I do lose you as friend. I don't care if you never come around to see the boys. I don't care if you finally get your shit together and start taking better of yourself. I don't care if you stop supporting me. I don't care if you never talk to me again. I now care about you the same way that you care about me. More than anything, I truly wish you the best. I don't wish anything ill towards you. I just want you to let me go. 

I know this is what I want. I guess I am typing this so that maybe I will convince myself not to fall into depression. I need to better myself. I need to focus on me. I can't let you keep having this hold on my life. "
"With the earnest effort to have this sub grow as a supportive community I felt it proper to begin with my own thoughts this early east coast US morning.

Of late I have been thinking of a woman I knew when she was a girl and when I was a boy. We were neighbors growing up and were hanging out together from 14 to 19. In those years we were both nearly naive in the subtleties of love.  

She was a creative person and did cool things like taking aluminum foil and molding it to her little brothers hand, leg and other arm, so those pieces could be secured to her bedroom ceiling as if her brother was falling through her ceiling in a metal mesh.  Pretty great stuff.

I have always been the more analytical one but truly enjoy the creative thought process and results. 

Well, we had gone to Senior prom together and as we grew up had a few times when either one of us were near to expressing love for the other.  Prom night was similar, but it didn't happen.  I think when you find someone you really love, and I mean REALLY love, not ""like"", it is awesome, except its hard because its not as easy as just saying hey, I want to hang out.

After school we hung out and played card games and had some beers almost nightly. Still, we never said those words.  Eventually I dated a woman and married her. This sweetheart of mine found a boyfriend.  We still hung out for a while after I married, but my wife became jealous as I do not lie and she knew she was my teen sweetheart, though it was never confirmed.  Long story short, my wife did not like me having my girl friend. I guess I can't blame her.

Anyway, a few years pass and marriage was good times overall, but that passed and we divorced.  I had lost touch with my girl friend.  A couple more years pass and I received a message from her. She and I reconnected, but we had taken different paths. 

Hers was risky party drugs and a lot of random sex.  Mine was some beer from time to time and marriage.  Well, she got sick.  Hep B. Meds take care of it so she feels ok and it keep it from killing her, but she has issues to work out now and like when we were teens, we cannot be together.  The difference is now we are able to express our love for each other.  It does feel something of two ships passing, but its also a good feeling.  

What I can advise is if you happen to have someone in your life who you really care about and love, and they seem to also feel that way, be bold and tell them.  It might actually be the one, as my girl friend is and was. One day perhaps we can be together."
"So, yesterday I woke up to the sound of my mom screaming at my dad. I planned to tell my mental health counselor, but I didn’t for some reason. I had woken up to that sound so many times, and now I’m just tired of it.

I’m still depressed, and my parents are only making it worse. I don’t know how my mom doesn’t realize that if you make a toxic environment for a child, they cannot function normally.

I’m really hoping and wishing that I will soon be able to live with my brother and sister. I would have moved in with my other brother but a few days ago his wife’s dad passed away, so I want to give her time to grieve.

Also, I asked my mom why she couldn’t just divorce my dad already and her reasoning is that he would make our lives a living hell, and that child custody is complicated. She also told me to never tell my dad that I hate him for the same reason, that he would make my life a living hell, as if he wasn’t already.

She also talked to me about how dysfunctional our family is, but to sum it up in a few words she told me to just deal with it.

When will this ever end? 

I need to get out of this house as soon as I can."
""
""
I'm physically very ill. I'm afraid of the procedure in a week and I really just wish I could get a hug. Or a distraction. I keep having panic attacks and random crying episodes. It has never been this bad haha.
"I was feeling motivated again today. It felt nice. 

It hit how different I talk to myself about myself when I feel like this. So forgiving to my past self for all that I’ve done. So warm that it engulfs me like a warm blanket fresh out of the drier. It feels so good. 

But like I’ve said before, as soon as it comes back it’s gone again. Slipping right through my fingers. It can be a matter of seconds from when I’m feeling that warmth to that bitter cold. It makes me feel like I’m crazy. That I can’t even trust myself to how I truly feel about myself. 

I’ve noticed too how it always starts. The sentence “it doesn’t matter anyway, I’ll never get to where I want to be.” Never get the body type I imagine myself as, never get into the schools that I dream of, never have the friends I think I wish for. None of it. 

I’ve also noticed i wish a lot. Like every day. Every other sentence in my head I’m wishing of a new, different, brighter life. 

My hope is that at least one or two of those wishes come true."
"Every night I bury myself
So that every morning I wake up new.

Every night I scream to my mother that I can feel the soil falling over my head. Sometimes it’s with the quirky somber wit of Morrissey and other times it’s with the loud screeching of Jeff Buckley.

But every night I swallow, choke and gag on the soil filling my lungs.

Every night I let pebbles and rocks fill my voids until I can no longer breathe. 

So tomorrow I can raise my hand through the soil like a born again zombie.

But instead of dead I arise new, soft and fresh. 

Ready to be alive for another day and bury the worst parts of my day so I can rise from the dirt again tomorrow. 

It’s my own morbid spa. My metaphorical skin has never looked better."
Fuck that. I cannot do anything. I am eating shit... masturbating too much... drinking too much... Cannot go to gym. Cannot meet people. Fuck that. I really really hope it is over soon.

"I might as well get this entry through before I gotta get up for work tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow's Monday, and even though last year we had at least a week off after Christmas, that was, you know, last year.

Christmas this year sucked. Just plain sucked. I can't complain too much because my family's still safe and sound, and nobody save for a few friends in the family have gotten the virus. Let's hope it stays that way, and let's hope those guys who do have it make a speedy recovery.

It's funny how my only gold standard for 2020 is simply being alive. Maybe I shouldn't be whining about it, considering there've been too many deaths around the world from this thing. I should be thankful I'm still standing.

I really need to take better care of myself. I think it goes without saying, but with so many people still cooped up within their homes and the aftermath of it, the health effects have been profound. My own health hasn't been the best, honestly, as much as I hate to admit. I should make that my New Year's resolution, even more than finding a better paying job.

I've heard of this new variant from the virus. It was supposedly first identified in the U.K. and now they've found it in Japan. From what the experts have been saying, apparently the virus has mutated and that this variant is already among the general population around the world. At least, that's what I understand from it. This type of expertise is out of my league, so I'll leave it to the professionals to figure it out.

The last thing we need is another strain of this thing breaking out, and I'm slated to get the vaccine for the current one so, please, no. We don't want another public healthcare crisis.

One happy thing I want to say is that my family was thankful for the gifts I got them. My mother and father, and my brother and sister. I'm worried for all of them.

I'm gonna end it here before I start moping into other topics. Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, or whatever you're into. And, to all a goodnight."
"What's painful is that I don't know where my words went...

And I'm supposed to be good with words. 

My words have all deflated from my mouth. Like a swift punch to my gut emptied the air from my lungs. Instead, it feels as though my lungs are filled with cement. I cannot speak. Or breathe.

All I can manage to do is spit out gravel and dust in the shape of painful syllables or short sentences. 

""I'm sorry.""

I scratch at my throat, desperate to squeeze something out. But there is nothing.

I'm supposed to be good with words. 
But standing here in front of you I seem to have lost them."
"12.22.18

I do not feel good
I am not happy

My weeks blur together and I accomplish assignment after assignment and shift after shift but I can’t keep my brain from telling me that I am not full.

I am not happy
I do not feel good

And why? Because every door to every lover I wasn’t looking for feels slammed on my face. Slammed right onto my hands and toes with a passing sentiment of “I want you to be happy.” 

And each lover expects me to keep trudging down the hall way. Trudging along with battered feet and broken hands. Leaving me to carry the cumulative weight they left behind in order to move on and be happier with themselves. This cumulative weight added to my own already heavy baggage that I have already been carrying, because they could not take the time to relieve some of my load.

They send me off, assuming I had wanted to open their door in the first place. Assuming I did not have somewhere else to be or that I was not simply side tracked. Assuming that my only purpose was to find their door unlocked, open it so they could take only what they needed and then have it promptly slammed in my face and locked.

I do not feel good. 
I am not happy. 

But with all the weight on my shoulders I keep going. 

Because I’ve got better things to do than let emotionally unavailable lovers slam doors in my face. 

Even though I am not happy

And I do not feel good

I know I am more than this."
"I went to the hospital recently for another checkup. The doctors there took a chest X-ray of me, because of the symptoms I was complaining about. They told me it was extremely unlikely it was due to the cigarette smoke. Anyway, the results came back and everything was perfectly healthy. Everything, except one thing: mild scarring. They said it's nothing to be concerned about, and that due to my age and health, it's not going to be hindering me.

Still, it is a slight worry. When I hear about pulmonary fibrosis, I usually think of patients who've been abusing drugs and smoking cigarettes for years. I didn't think it would happen to me, albeit ever so mildly. Otherwise, I feel better. I can breathe just fine, so there's no need to worry about being put on an oxygenator or anything like that.

Damn, now this worries me greatly. A vaccine is underway to be distributed soon, but with this virus still floating around and it targeting, primarily, the respiratory system, I hope nothing bad will happen to me.

Bah! I worry too damn much! In fact, the chief ENT who did a follow-up after the ""junior"" ENT checked up on me said, jokingly (half-jokingly, actually), that unless I've recently been exposed to gamma radiation or I'm sucking down on asbestos pipes, I have nothing to worry about. Seriously, those were his exact words.

Scars never heal, even in the lungs, so I'm shit out of luck there. I'm not sure what ""mild"" is for the radiologist, but the report said it didn't require a follow-up so I think I'm good. I could always go for a second opinion at another hospital, but honestly, I'm too damn tired at this point. I just want to get back to work and have things go normally.

There's also the issue of insurance. Thankfully, my insurance covered everything fully, but if I keep going back and forth for these procedures, it's going to eventually run me up. Then, as every American's nightmare is, I'll have to pay out of pocket. And I'm not talking about small co-payments, I mean I'll have to pay the whole damn bill. No thank you.

The doctors tell me the scarring was most likely from years of me having these cough fits. I've never smoked a cigarette in my entire life, nor have I been exposed to any industrial chemicals that could such damage, let alone harmful radiation. I don't know anymore. I just hope it stays this way and doesn't get any worse. The last thing I need is to be hooked up on a ventilator.

I'm gonna talk to the physician next to our lab. He's a pulmonologist, a lung doctor, who's got over 30 years of experience under his belt. If anyone knows about this kind of stuff, it's that guy.

I'll try to relax for the weekend. I'll be okay."
"I'm sick and tired of various presidential candidates in the US imploring me for a $25 donation to their campaign. I do understand that getting elected is expensive and that the other side has all this so-called dark money and what-nots, but it isn't relevant to this entry. 

Indeed, I will argue the politicians who have the most impact are those who aren't asking for my money as often, if at all. For whom getting a 30% turnout is a big deal -- by contrast the presidential turnout has hovered a bit over 60%. Yes, these are our mayors, city council members, and the other local officials, mainly faceless who execute whatever dictats come from higher levels of government. 

People tell me that Trump was elected in 2016 by those who had voted for Obama but didn't vote for Clinton.  I'm not going to speculate whether it was a judoka in Moscow who is to blame for this or sexism. That is out-of-scope, to borrow a software phrase. 

NAFTA didn't ship the industrial jobs to Mexico. It's your local officials that failed to create incentives that would have kept the jobs in town. Yes, NAFTA made it cheaper to do business in Mexico and Canada. But, the race-to-the-bottom could have been avoided had, say, the governor of Michigan announced a tariff on imported [brake parts](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mexico-jobs-20161212-story.html) not manufactured in the state of the discount in prevailing wages, which would have negated the sort of wage difference. 

Indeed, the state could make it cheaper to manufacture **in state** through the power of the purse, by just levying taxes on goods from out of state equivalent to the wage differential and relying on the strength of the market to keep manufacturing from leaving. Fundamentally, if you want to alleviate the effects of a free-trade agreement, elect local officials who won't ship your state's businesses out. 

Why didn't this happen? Because the working class doesn't vote. ""But, /u/cruyff8"", I hear you say, ""the media said the workers elected Donald Trump"". Yes, I know they have that rhetoric. The data simply doesn't bear that out, though.

It wasn't the working class who elected Donald Trump. It wasn't [some bloke sitting in his underpants in Macedonia](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo) either. What it was is that a low turnout, as a result of how difficult voting has become in the US, coupled with the sheer amount of time it takes to fill out a ballot -- my wife has a doctorate and it takes her at least 3 hours to completely mark up her ballot -- makes it so that all but those with the most idle time to vote, actually do vote. In other words, not the working class.

Both parties realize this. Their candidate's victory does not depend on the working class. This is why Trump doesn't care about calling upon mask-less protesters to [liberate Michigan](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/biden-blames-trumps-liberate-michigan-tweet-for-plot-to-kidnap-michigan-governor/ar-BB1a6WTm). These are not voters. They are pawns. If they were voters, parties would be more receptive to their needs, as there are more working class Americans than the upper class. 

Progress takes place when the middle classes form the bulk of the voting population. The Great Society? New Deal? All passed before Nixon's [Southern Strategy](https://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-southern-strategy.htm), which was less about persuading and more about suppressing turnout in, not only southern, but all states in the Union. This is when my mother-in-law started having to spend hours filling out her ballot, sealing it and dropping it off. 

In all likelihood, Joe Biden [will win](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/) on November 3. But that's not enough, we need to elect working class heroes throughout state, county, and local governments as well. Because, even if Trump wins, it is they who will be able to alleviate some of his disastrous policies."
"  

They say, “first love never dies.” I’d have to say it’s true to me, too. I still can’t forget about him although I haven’t seen him for over six years. I might not remember exactly how he looks and what kind of person he is, but there is always a day or two in a year that I’d catch myself unconsciously thinking of him. For the very first time in a long while, I openly talked about him today.

Unlike others whose first love experience may be comparable to a thrilling rollercoaster ride, mine was a lonesome trip back home— uneventful.

“If you love a flower, don’t pick it up. Because if you pick it up, it dies and it ceases to be what you love. So if you love a flower, let it be. Love is not about possession.” I lived by these words of Osho. My first love did not know me and neither did I. I convinced myself that I was already contented with admiring him from afar just as how I'd be satisfied with keeping a memory of a panoramic view in my head rather than take a picture of it for keepsakes.

I met my first love back in college. It was on June 7, 2010, when I first saw him. I couldn’t say if it was love at first sight or just my penchant for memorizing significant dates in my life which made me remember the exact date of our first meeting. After all, that day itself is truly memorable. It was the first day of college, and a mixture of unfamiliar emotions overwhelmed me at that time.

It was freshmen night and we all gathered at the university grandstand to witness some dance numbers, games, and band performances. I was just standing alone taking in my new environment and observing new people when he caught my attention. Was it his height that got me? Was it his looks? Maybe, both. I saw him talking to a bunch of other freshmen and they seemed to be getting to know each other. Good for them, they have the guts to socialize and make new friends—the things I couldn’t effortlessly do even until now. 

For four years, I’d been having a crush on him. There was never a day that I did not think of him. He was always hovering in my head. Looking back, almost all of my journal entries were about my chance encounters of him like how I naively befriended my classmate just to know his name and how glimpses of him would make my day complete.

During our third year in college, I was brokenhearted when I found out that he got himself a girlfriend. I couldn’t recall if I cried but I’m pretty sure that I felt depressed for days and weeks. I remember pouring all my thoughts out in my diary (now, I’m dying to read it and cringe). However, his being in a relationship did not stop my infatuation. I continued liking him from afar, and I was contented (or maybe I thought I was).

Sadly, they broke up a few months after our graduation. He went to law school where he found his new love which unfortunately lasted for a few years. Like his previous relationship, I sincerely wanted him to end up with his “second” girlfriend already because she was a real catch.

Even up to now, I could say that I still have a tiny bit of crush on him. I occasionally visit his social media accounts. Tonight, I found out that he created new Instagram and Facebook accounts for a fresh start in career and love.

I am happy with what he has become. Every now and then, I may have the urge to pick up the flower I love but I always keep Osho’s wise words in mind and in action. And yes, these words may make me live alone for the rest of my life."
"It’s December. Holidays have been rough for me the last six years because I always end up alone. Last year was the first Christmas I had in a long time where I felt some happiness and importance. I’m afraid I won’t feel happy this year.

I won’t lie, it’s hard right now. The more I try to hide that from people, the worse I end up feeling when it slips out. I feel like I don’t deserve anything, I am just a hollow body full of regrets and melancholy.

Something I deeply want is to wake up on Christmas morning with excitement again. I want a living tree, adorned with sentimental ornaments collected throughout the years and presents underneath. Sunlight peaking through the window and falling upon the room. Christmas music humming in the background. Someone who loves me.

I want this month to end now."
"Dear diary,
Reddit always tells write an interesting title.
The title can be titled only when I give shape to my thoughts going on now in my mind.
Though I am thankful for the life God has given me, I yearn that my son be given a girlfriend.
The world is full of love stories (and break up stories too)
My son is almost thirty and why he has not clicked with a girl friend?
He goes out and definitely meets girls why why he is spending more time with us?
We have been given the responsibility of searching a bride for him.
This is not happening. (The small success is four girls were interviewed and none of them clicked) The parents we talk and the girl and the boy talk.
Damn it the cupidity is not happening.
I have lost faith in these matrimonial sites. 
Some way - should be there.
God show me.
God don’t show me.
Show to my boy.
What is life without a girlfriend or spouse?
Diary when I come to write here next, you should have shown a love life for him.
Hopefully I remain 
Balu."
"I find it hard to share how I feel lately. I think that’s why I get so frustrated easily, because I am too confused and it stresses me out. Time keeps passing me by and I grasp at straws trying to figure out what I want and need to do. If only I could just do this, act this way, feel this way... Except I just can’t seem to manage that. How do I make myself change? I don’t even know what I want still. I think about the future and the possibilities, what would be good for me, but I guess it’s hard to work for that future when I honestly still don’t even want a future... Most of my mistakes seem to be self sabotage. I still struggle to believe I deserve anything good, that I deserve to be alive, that I deserve to be happy. I still struggle with making myself want to be alive."
"Time is starting to lose its effect on me. What I mean by that is, I don't feel like the calendar is a big deal anymore. I feel as if time is such an arbitrary thing. I had the day off today, and now it's gone, and I'll have to get back to work tomorrow. It feels as if everything is going faster and faster. I want it to slow down. I want more time.

Maybe I'm getting mopey with my philosophical insights, if you can even call them that, but I feel somewhat detached. I don't know how to describe it. I guess I've become so accustomed to my job and this new lifestyle, it's become almost robotic. 

Do you ever feel like the days just keep repeating themselves? The same people, the same faces, the same cars with the same license plates, and the same folks going at the same time at the same places. Society refers to this phenomenon as ""familiar strangers"", because, of course, everybody has a routine, no matter how mundane it may be. It's an odd feeling. I hate it.

I've been thinking about my future. I don't know what I'll do after this. I mean, I do *have* a plan, but I don't feel comfortable leaving this environment. Hah, but see, that's just the thing. I say all of that, and yet I know that I want to leave. I've been harping on how about how the pay sucks, etc., etc. in all of my entries for the umpteenth time. It's gotten to the point where it's nauseating and pretentious to read about.

Then again, this is my diary, so who the hell cares? To anyone who's reading this, or has bothered reading this, you must be either incredibly bored or incredibly fascinated by this stranger who's typing away almost nonsensical thoughts through this medium.

I don't even feel like sleeping. I feel like I could stay awake forever. And, before anyone asks, no, I'm not on drugs.

Maybe I need a vacation, but I feel like this routine has become part of me now that if I were to take a break, it would throw everything off. Is this what it's like to be ""married to your job""? Only time will tell, I suppose.

Have a safe day."
"So, tomorrow is my 14th birthday, and I'm not all that excited. The reason being that I would probably have to spend it with my sister, and I still haven't forgiven her for everything that she has done to me and my family. I will only forgive her once she shows signs of actual progress with her anger issues, but that most likely won't be happening anytime soon.

Oh, the reason that I would have to spend my birthday with my sister is because she destroyed her relationship with all 3 of my brothers. I was actually thinking that I would have fun on my birthday. My brothers would come over and we would play smash and Mario party and have a great time. But no. Our family can't be together and happy because of 2 God damned people. My sister and my dad.

When I asked my sister if my brothers would be coming over she said ""I don't know. You know that we aren't friends right? But you can plan something with them.""

That statement honestly broke my heart. I just want my family to be to be together and happy. But that will never happen.

Also, I see absolutely no reason why my sister wouldn't be friends with one of my brothers, who let her stay in his home for idk how many weeks/months rent free. That was an extremely generous act, and now she just kicks him to the curb. It's absolutely disgusting.

And about my other brother, she claims he ""assaulted"" her. She was the one that escalated the situation anyway.

Another thing to add is that a few days ago I heard my sister talking to my mom about therapy prices. I haven't heard anything about it since. I kinda find it funny though. When she went to see my therapist for one appointment a few months ago, she hated it. I highly doubt the therapy is for her or that she's actually going to change.

But yeah, I just wish that I can have a birthday where my family is together and happy."
"Dear R 

""Hi. How are you?"" , I would have said if we were still talking. I would have asked you multiple times a day. And multiple intrusive questions. You too would have, isn't it? 

You are very sweet. I wish you meet many people who tell you so. So sweet that I would __________ , I would drink spoiled milk if you cheered for me, that it worries me how many people have hurt you. When people get undeserving and unearned things, they don't know what ( /how ) to do. 

If we still talked I would have debated if I should rant to you or not, and then wouldn't have. I used to think that if I rant I would give a negative vibe, and then you wouldn't like me much. My opinion on this is still the same. But , in retrospect I know I should have. It would have only been better if you would have thought I was a negative person with negative thoughts who only had things to rant about. Even if you hadn't thought so, it would have been better. Actually I do have things to rant about now but I don't know how or what to say...is it even worthwhile to say it. And it's like I am having a block that I don't want to force atm when I am trying to think it or write it. 

Is blue your favourite colour. I like blue too. The shade of the sky. Sometimes dark shades too. But some shades are aweful. With all colours. Do you like the deep ocean? Or are you scared of it? It must be scary. So dark and below and among creatures with various unknown abilities. I want to be lost in a place like that. Or nowhere. Is there a place nowhere? There's Neverland , kingdom of far far away. I hope there's no place called Nowhere because I want to get lost nowhere. Should I tell you my parents are fighting again? There never stop. I know they never will. But I wonder if they want to not fight. Will they miss it , and feel a vacuum if ever by miracle they stop.. Like after some weeks of intensive preparation of exams, you feel a weird vacuum when it's over. I think it's better if they don't want to stop. Because it would be really difficult to keep on fighting so bad and , while inside you just want it to stop. 

I know what I would want with one of my 3 wishes - it would be my mother gets dementia. I am sorry that I didn't even think of you when I was thinking of the wishes. 

Do you know I realised I am not as good as I used to think I was? I don't see many people who are even satisfactorily good. Why do I have these standards of perfection. I don't want my OCD to be as bad as my mother's; it's not good. I wonder if I only think of myself, and not about others. I look at my father and see the so many things he's adamant about and thus distressed about, and want to tell him to stop and look and think logically. And, but there are so many things I myself am adamant about...in an illogical way. 

I would not have known you if the things he regrets didn't happen. In regrets we forget that there are scores of other alternate possibilities which could have been both better or worse or well, it depends how deep in what shit one is. Sometimes logic is so detached from what we think, how we feel and what the norms are ; and yet the consequences can be explained logically. Is it science or random guessing. 

Well all I wanted to say is- I don't want to be here or anywhere. I don't want to know I exist. I don't want to feel, see, understand or need anything. I just don't want to be. 

It's been a long time and I am with no shame only talking about myself. I have no idea where you are. I will say the same things I want to say to you. With my second wish, I would want you to get Nobel Prize. Lol jk. I would want you to have every happiness and peace. 

I wish you are doing well."
"Have you ever felt a love so much towards someone that you might explode? So many feelings for a person because they mean so much to you that you don't know what to do if they disappeared? I wonder if its some type of disease. A medical condition. I've been diagnosed. Ever since I was little I knew I had a problem. I'd pour my heart and soul into everything and everyone that I was close to. I noticed it wasn't normal. But it didn't stop me. I thought everyone was the same too, but I learned that quickly. It seemed the more I poured into every one, the less I got in return. Why couldn't they see? I thought for most of my childhood maybe they just don't notice. They can't see. But now in my early adulthood, I have discovered I was wrong. They do notice. They just don't seem to care. 

People like to be built up I've learned. They enjoy being praised. But what happens when the person that does all the praising has nothing left to give? When the person that builds them up constantly, feels so torn down. First hand, I've learned that they don't care. They see you. They hear you. But they do nothing to help. Years of your time and energy, completely wasted. 

They don't care. They take everything out of you, and then they abandon you. After everything you've done for them. Have they forgotten about you? Do they still think of you? The girl who gave up everything. The girl who exhausted herself. The girl who was dying on the inside. She did everything. She continued to do everything. Just to make people happy. Just to make them feel loved. Just so they wouldn't feel like she always does. 

And yet. They always leave. 

The first friend she had. They had known each other since birth. They did everything together. Grew up together. Sleepovers. Birthdays. Homeschool field trips. Played in the creek together. Practically inseparable. Learned how to grow up together. Learned about family together. Lost family together. Learned about each other. Learned about boys. She found her first boy. And then. She grew up. In the blink of an eye. She became cold. She became hurtful. She became a ghost. And everything the girl knew from birth was now gone. The first friend didn't want her anymore. She wasn’t good enough. 

Her first friend had found a boy. So maybe she would do the same. And she did. A smiley one from another school. He played sports. He was kind. Their friendship began. They found a lot in common. They talked about everything under the sun. Books. Movies. Sports. Shows. Each other. They had nicknames. They talked non stop every day for years. And then suddenly he stopped. He left. Without any explanation. He was gone. The first boy didn't want her anymore. She wasn’t good enough. 

Years later, She fell in love. The boy on the bus. The new kid. The one with his green hood up. No one talked to him. He sat alone. She knew she had to get to know him. And so she did. And soon after, they were always with each other. She met his family. He met her family. They went on adventures together. Every single week they would find somewhere new. But it seemed that when the girl liked the boy, he didn't feel the same. Or when the boy liked the girl, she didn't feel the same. But one day, they both felt the same. And they fell hard for one another. They started planning their future. And one day in the middle of everything. He vanished. He blocked her number. He blocked her Facebook. He blocked her entire family. He was never seen or heard from again. Two days later she found out he had been engaged. For years. And that he had just been married. Just like that. The second boy had wanted someone else. She hadn’t been good enough. 

The third boy.. was a little older. She had thought about previously, maybe someone older was the way to go. They'd be more mature. More knowledgable. She had met him online. They talked every single day for two years straight. He was smart and handsome. He was kind. He was so mature. He showered her with praises. And gifts. They videoed all the time. She introduced him to her friends. He introduced her to his coworkers. Just as she had started to think maybe he was different. Maybe this was it. Maybe this was the one who would finally see her. They made plans to meet. And he stopped all contact. He ghosted her. He simply.. disappeared. She found out later that he was married for years with three children. The whole time. And she had no idea. The third boy had never wanted her to begin with. She never was good enough. 

She told herself she was done with boys. With all men. She found friendship online instead. A website to write stories. You share them with people. They share stuff back. She met a girl almost ten years ago. And through their writing blossomed an amazing friendship. They became so close. They never went an hour without talking. They video chatted nonstop. Always talking about their writing and their ideas. The girl flew out to Calfornia to meet her for the first time. They went on vacations together. Everyone knew that they were the best of friends. You couldn't have one without the other. The girl was finally happy again. She had finally found someone who cares. Who knew everything about her. Who she could tell everything to. She cried with her. She laughed with her. They grew together. They were so happy. Through the years they grew closer and closer. It was the happiest the girl had ever been. Together they had decided the girl would pack up and move to California to be closer to her best friend, and to start living her life. 

And so she did. She moved. She forgot all of her past troubles. She was only thinking about how fantastic the future was now going to be surrounded by so much happiness and love. Through her best friend, she met more friends. More people to be happy with. And then she met the boy. The boy who would be her permanent happiness. And through him, she was slowly healed from everything in her past. All the hurt. But her best friend didn't like that. Her best friend wanted to be the only one to heal the girl. And with that, her best friend suddenly became exactly like her past friends. Her past relationships. She became hurtful. She became rude. She became someone the girl had never met before. And then she too became a ghost. 

Her best friend. Her world. The girl who knew everything about her. Who she couldn't go an hour without talking to. Her joy. The girl she would go to when she was sad. Or angry. Or even filled with happiness. She was now gone. And now the girl was alone. The best friend had taken everyone with her when she left. The girl now only had her boy.

Her boy became her happiness. He slowly broke down the walls she had spent years building. He became her world. He is still her world. And she is filled with so much love for him she could implode. She was finally good enough. 

But somehow.

Still.

She waits for it to be over. Because it's all she's ever known. She's never remained happy. It's only a matter of time before she will find herself alone again. It's her only thought process now. With everyone she's close to. It's all going to happen again. And it's all her fault. Everything has to be her fault.. right? Because there's no way she can be abandoned so often by so many people and it's all them.. right? It's her. It's always been her. There's something wrong with her. There always has been. A mental disorder. A disease. A medical condition. No one seems to care that she cares too much."
"This isn’t to start a debate. Only to share a story from my thoughts that will never be told.

Also excuse my formatting as I am on mobile.

You don’t want to be a Police Officer in today’s society. It’s that simple, you don’t. Just because I put on a uniform it means I am a murderer, a racist, a bigot, and overall a bad human being. But from my experiences, cops are among the most honorable people I have met. They ask for little in return for what they do. I know this because I am the same way. We don’t talk about the wounds that may never heal, the wounds I have from the things I’ve seen.

Everyone is talking about how every Police Officer is bad because of the actions of 4 men. Well let me tell about my actions as a Police Officer the day George Floyd was killed.

We were sitting at the PD, just joking around and waiting for the mid shift guys to go 10-7 (out of service). The dispatcher comes over the radio and says “1839, for a priority medical on 1st Street.” I look at my partners who are about to get off and key up for the what might have been the first call of the night. “1839, go ahead”, I say, as I’m thinking about the words that I’m going to hear next. The dispatcher comes back over the air and says, “1839, 1825 to back, for a priority medical, 123 1st Street, possible overdose, 24 year old male, not conscious, aganal breathing. Unknown drinking and drugs.” As I’m gathering my radio and flashlight I reply with haste, “1839, all squads copy, show us en route.” 

We run to our cars as we know every second counts. Driving there, I was in a line of police cars, 3 out of 4. As we race through the night, I can see the red and blue lights illuminate the trees as I hear the roar of the engine while I drive down the road. I try to calm my nerves and my pounding heart and go through in my mind what my plan is when I show up on scene. We are screaming down an empty road as I hear dispatch come over the radio again. “1800 squads en route to the medical, patient is still not conscious, and is no longer breathing. CPR instructions are being given.” 

I focus back in on my partner ahead of me who has stepped on his accelerator and is starting to pull away from me. I do the same and we continue forward. All the while I’m going over in my head what needs to be done. “Okay...okay...okay...CPR...30 chest compressions and 2 rescue breaths..wait I have to open the airway first and stabilize the neck.” I think to myself all while driving down the road, lights and sirens, trying to juggle; focusing on my partner ahead, watching the road and ensuring my path is clear, watching intersections because I don’t want anyone to pull out in front of me, thinking about what I’m going to do when I get there, and I’m also putting on my latex gloves.

As I pull up, I see a man lying in the middle road. A woman is running toward us, but I don’t remember her screaming, hell, I don’t remember hearing my siren during my code run (lights and siren activated). I see my one of my partners running up and he starts CPR. I see my other partner run to the trunk of his squad and start to ready the medical bag. I run past my partner readying the medical bag and I get down on my knees beside our patients head and look into the eyes of a dead man. 

I open his airway as I can see my partner pushing down on this mans chest. I check for breathing, there is none. I check for a pulse, there isn’t one. I look down at this man, who isn’t a day older than me. His mouth is barely open, his eyes are closed and he is covered in sweat. My other partner comes running over and begins to prepare the BVM (Bag Valve Mask) to delivery oxygen to our patient. 

My partner says, “DarksideSix28, I’m getting tired, I need you to take over!” Now me, 24 years old, I have never performed CPR on someone until tonight. I get up without hesitation, run around to my partner, and tap him on the back and say “I got this partner, take a break.” I look down on this mans lifeless face and begin to perform CPR on him, in hopes my efforts may bring him back to life. As I push down, I can hear him grunting and I can feel the already broken bones in his chest. I think back to my training and I count out loud, “1, 2, 3...”. My partner gives the rescue breaths and I begin the process again. After a few rounds I start to get tired and my supervisor taps in to give me a break. 

“He needs Narcan! It’s in the bag!” I hear and I reach into the bag and pull out Narcan, which is essentially a syringe which goes into the nostril to stop the overdose. Now I’ve never used it before, I’ve only read about it in a book. I thought it would be like the button you press when priming a small engine with gasoline. It was not.

I shove the end of the syringe into his nostril and press, but it’s not like I thought. It was a button. I continue to press, and press, and press but i feel like it’s not working. I feel this thought come over me as I feel as though I’m doing more harm than good. I exclaim “it’s not F——— working!” As my supervisor says, “it is! You’re doing good! Resume CPR!” I feel myself getting overwhelmed and start my breathing procedures to keep myself calm (as calm as you can be in that situation).

After about 5 minutes, the medics arrive and I let them take over, I stand by feeling absolutely helpless as they work on this dead man, in the middle of 1st Street, in “My City” at 0030 on a Monday morning, May 25th, 2020. 

We ended up having to force a tube down his throat because his airway closed. The medics gave him an IV of Narcan and he came back to life. 

He then started to play on his phone and acted like nothing was wrong, like nothing had just happened. I remember the feeling of shock as he was wheeled into the ambulance. I thought to myself, “you were dead not even 5 minutes ago. I looked over you and felt your lifeless body under my palms.” 

In the end, my partners and I brought him back from the land of dead. We saved his life that night. Had we not been there, or had we not responded to the call, he would have died on the street at 123 1st Street, at 0030 on a Monday in “My City”. 

Now with the climate, I mention this at the end. All 4 of us Police Officers, are white. This man was African American and not even 12 hours later George Floyd lost his life. Race didn’t play a card in what I did, it didn’t even cross my mind. I saw a man who needed my help and I acted. 

The many say that ALL cops are racist, but than night I risked my life and safety to save a man who I’ve never met and will probably never see again, a man who was a different race. In the end that doesn’t matter, because to the many, I’m a racist because I put on a uniform. I don’t do it for recognition or accolades. I do it because I am a servant of the people and it’s my job."

Me happy. Me proud."
"Hello!

*Sorry for my bad English, I am still studying it. Also, I may be losing the thread of my story because of this.*

There is become harder and harder for me to write about my daily stuff because for now, every day is like the day before. The main purpose I am writing is to improve my English skills. Instead of writing about what I did this week, I have to dive deep into my feelings and dig out of them my attitudes towards the situation in the world.

After a month of sitting in my flat in the middle of Russia, I began to realize that I am a really lucky guy in contrast to most people. I even want to count the lucky counts. Some of them are very mundane, but anyway.

I paid out my mortgage the month before quarantine in my city was declared. If I had lost my job, the problem with payments wouldn’t have bothered me. But I didn’t lose my job. Even my salary has not decreased, despite the fact that I am not actually working for now. So I've got plenty of time, and it happened at the exact moment when my English level becomes well enough to read and watch educational videos without Russian subtitles and checking vocabulary every 5 minutes.

I think it is the first time in my life when I am using my free time really effectively. I started reading Reddit since the previous week. Also, I’ve discovered Quora. I registered at EDX and, OMG, how many useful courses are there! I spent all previous week reading recommendations and scrolling lists of free courses without the ability to choose one or two of them! Of course, we have a lot of resources and free educational courses in Russian. But there are big differences between quality, quantity, and in the ease of finding.

I had tried studying English since I was 20 (I also studied it at school). But only after 9 years I've reached any meaningful level. And I am wondering what if I did it then! How much could I learn… I don’t know if it’s appropriate but I would say that if you guys have the ability of understanding English (of course you have!) and for now you don’t have any real problems related to this situation (I certainly hope so) you definitely should spend this time wisely.

I’m sure you have heard this for every time from your favorite bloggers, friends, teachers. But as a person who just find and opened a new big world of opportunities a would repeat it. You have many more opportunities than many people in the world. For example, a couple of days ago I compare a quantity of work offers at the field I am interested in between LinkedIn and one of the most popular job search sites in Russia. It was about sports management related jobs. So I found several hundred offers at LinkedIn and only two (!) on the Russian site. One of them was a salesman at a sneaker store and the second is a statistics related to freelance work I already had!

I don’t want to say that my country is bad or something about it. Of course, we have a lot of opportunities (at least in my field) if you dig deep. I just tried to describe my experience and mind-blowing feelings when I saw the difference between opportunities and ease of getting useful information. I understand that our world has changed and nobody can tell what will happen next month. But one thing I know for sure, there may not be a better time than now to change yourself. Especially in this horrible moment.

So look around, maybe you're the luckiest person."
"I bought the game yesterday, on a whim, really. You'd been looking forward for weeks now, and I figured if you found it so much fun, maybe I would too. And with the whole quarantine going on, it's something to get me through the day. The game is surprisingly fun and addicting, but playing it gave me an excuse to talk to you again. I wonder if it's weakness (did I really spend 60 dollars to give me a reason to talk to you?) or if I'm doing this for me (come on, you need something to do while on lockdown). At every reply you give me, I'm asking myself if you really want to talk to me. Do you secretely hate me? Am I not understanding hints you're throwing? Am I imagining things? If you were just another stranger from the internet, just another human being, I wouldn't care less about your existence. But you are too much to my liking, too interesting, too peculiar to just ignore, to let go. All the time and emotions I have invested in trying to figure out where we can go might just be worth it one day. But the road I'm paving hurts. And I don't know for how long this can go on, how long I can withstand it. You're worth it, in theory, but I can see us ending in so many different ways, many not so positive. It makes it hard, but I'll try, because I see potential for something really good, and I cling to it. I really want us to work. I really want you as my friend. Even though sometimes you're impossible. I guess I am too."
"Sometimes, I don’t feel like I deserve my family. I grew up with my mom and dad living in separate households, with them never really telling me exactly what made them live apart, but knowing they would never be under the same roof again. So my mom was the one who worked her ass off, shouldered not only the responsibility of caring for me but also whatever resentment she had for my father, which never really went away. She met another man 20 years and have had two children since then. I have never felt like anything less than a son to my stepfather or my step-grandparents. My step-grandparents house is my second home and have done more for me than I could have ever asked for. For what it’s worth, I grew up okay, went through school, out on my own doing okay. So I don’t know why I feel like shit and like I can’t confide in my family, the way other sons and daughters do. I’m in my mid 20s and I still don’t feel like there is much I know or even care to know about my family, on all sides. I see my friends with their cousins, aunts, uncles and they all seem to know each other so well. And I’m happy for them, but it also just makes me feel fucking lonely sometimes. 

I’m trying to take it into my own hands and visit family members more, because I know that we’re getting older and my mom isn’t exactly transparent about her health. My moms health has been deteriorating the last couple of years and we’ve had some close scares. I just get so upset with myself and having to walk into the hospital because I went to school for health sciences and feel like I could’ve done more for her. Like she shouldn’t have gotten to the point of having to be hospitalized if only I cared more and talked to her about what she’s eating or drinking or what she’s doing wrong and how to fix it. Because I should know better. 

My step-dad has been taking care of my mother for the time being, with me living out of state. For the last couple of months, they’ve all been staying with my step-grandparents helping take care of her. I try to call and offer advice, but it can only go so far. I feel like I need to be more present in their lives. I feel like I should be the one shouldering a lot of this responsibility for them but I’m not there to do so. 

I just feel like I’m so distant to the people I’m supposed to be closed to."
"My presentation is on Wednesday, and I'm eager to show it to the team. Again, it's not my paper, and I'm sure they'll enjoy it. The paper was written by two physicians and a scientist (PhD) who are interested in cardiovascular health, which is something not too dissimilar on what we're investigating.

The presentation should be a minimum of 20 minutes and a maximum of 30 minutes. I don't want to bore them with all the technical details, but I need to give them the background as to what these investigators were looking into. It shouldn't take me too long, but I should expect questions along the way. That is, if everyone will stay awake for it. Yeah, it's during our lab meeting at 8 in the morning, so everyone is not in a cheery mood. I put as much life as I could into this presentation, but I also need to have an engaging voice, lest everyone falls asleep.

Like I said, it isn't my paper, so I don't think they're going to be too attached to the research done by these other eggheads. Otherwise, I've got a long week ahead of me.

Our scientist who lost almost everything in that freezer fiasco is still sick. Apparently, from what I understand, she opened the freezer door on the day she found out--we found out--all the samples were ruined. But, when she opened that door, she most likely breathed in the mold, bacteria, viruses or god-knows-what on the other side. So, now she's still sick. I hope she'll get better by tomorrow.

God, I wish I got paid more. I wish we *all* got paid more!"
"I built a bunk bed today on my own. It may not be such an accomplishment to others but for me it is. I could’ve sat and wallowed. I could have numbed my brain with YouTube videos. However I built a whole bed and that’s dope! I also set some goals for myself... 1. to keep my intentions pure 2. to put out positive energy 3. to feel more empathy, & 4. To allow myself to relax! Today was a good day and I’m very proud of myself🌞"
"The entirety of these entries are going to be nearly dedicated to my workplace if I keep it up at this pace. Although the people I work with are amazing, they're also mad. Mad, as in, they're insane. I've great respect for the work they do and have been doing before I was even born, but I would be lying if I didn't say that staying in the lab and running throughout the hospital for their clinical work (if they're practicing medical doctors), is driving their sanity up the wall.

One particular individual who's been worrying me is a physician/scientist who works two floors above us. He's actually a pretty nice guy once you get to know him better, but he's constantly on edge. Seriously, I cannot make eye contact with the guy without him piercing into my soul. He's also an assistant professor at the nearby medical school, so you can imagine the amount of overwhelming stress he's being stacked with. Still, I don't like the way he behaves or looks at me sometimes. He's certainly a mad scientist from what I've seen, and so I should keep my distance away from him and interactions with the guy to an absolute minimum.

Working with these white coats can be challenging, especially if something doesn't go their way or if they weren't informed about something about their lab or experiment. I try to be as efficient and consistent as possible with my work and communication, but I make mistakes, too. 

Some of these eggheads from the other labs, at least from what I've heard, can be insufferably demanding. While I understand patients' lives are on the line here, I'd rather have a researcher who's more relaxed and comfortable in their environment to take their pace with their work rather than one who's rushed and hurried to make deadlines. Yes, academia has deadlines just like industry. Journals to submit your peer-reviewed articles to have a deadline; grant funding requests have deadlines; and, certainly, a dying patient's life has a deadline. You can understand why a lot of these professionals tend to be driven to boiling point levels of stress.

I actually did make a mistake today, and it's something I'm not happy about. You see, the last few weeks were our hiatus. We took those weeks off to be with our friends and families for the holidays. Unfortunately, biomedical research has no pause button, so there always needs to be someone at the lab, even during the holiday time. I was one of the only scientists who tended to the specimens and the lab's general operations. As a matter of fact, I was alone for some days in the lab, literally having the entire place to myself. With nobody to communicate with or check any of my mistakes, I ended up looking past something important that was on one of our entry logs on our lab's network. Long story short, that mistake caught up with me--with us--today. Suffice it to say, one of the seniors was not happy with me.

Ah, well, I shouldn't be beating myself too much. It wasn't anything major like the lab burning down or a majority of the specimens dying on us. Still, I do take happiness in my work and in being as punctual and communicative as possible with the rest of the team.

Tomorrow is going to be entirely dedicated to molecular biological bench work. They'll probably have me running PCR for genotyping their specimens. Again. 

I'll pay closer attention to what I'm doing before jumping to do it. I'm worried I might become mad, just like the rest of them."
"I got sad a few hours ago because of jealousy, so I decided to drink alone before I go home. I had only one glass of Weng Weng and a plate of garlic mushroom. I planned to get two glasses of Weng Weng but I already got really tipsy with just one glass, and I was afraid I won't be able to walk home if I get one more. I was alone so I thought I should at least be a responsible adult. Got home safe after ~10 minutes of walking. I missed this feeling of getting drunk. It's been a while."
"Happy New Year! And now that I've got that out of my system, I hope that things will be even better with the upcoming decade.

I should be so lucky that I landed this job. The people I'm with are nothing but kind and professional. Certainly, nobody is perfect, but these guys are the best. I couldn't ask for a better team of eggheads.

The NYE party went well. I don't drink so I ended up being a chauffeur for a lot of drunken hooligans to take home. I don't mind, and as long as they get home in one piece, I can sleep soundly at night. There are too many DUIs on New Year's Day (and Eve), so having a designated, sober driver is a blessing for many. 

Anyway, same old, same old. I got more training to do tomorrow with some of the new toys we brought into the lab. One of the engineers from a company is going to give us a crash course on how to utilize them properly. 

There's bound to be interesting things happening along this new year, but they've yet to come. In the meantime, I need to chill out and stop getting so tense about my work.

Happy New Year to all!"
"I'm new to this. Not sure if I'm doing this correctly.
*Rereads the rules*

*Thinks to myself*

I've not had a public online journal before but I'm completely interested in trying. Perhaps this is the place for it-or maybe it isn't. I'll come to find out soon enough.

Dear Diary,
(I used to use the ""Dear Teddy"" heading because well he was my BFF. You know, just a girl and her bear. We shared so many wonderful secrets. You've been replaced but not forgotten old friend.)

As I sit and remember all the times I've journaled and how so much of what I did was coping I am reminded of the necessity of simply getting it out.

So, here I go. A decade or so later attempting to get the jumbled thoughts inside my head out.

Eh, I'll restart this again... You know, for old time sake. 


Dear Teddy,

I know we have parted ways so many years ago and I hope you are somewhere not collecting dust. In fact I hope you are being the joyful bear that you always were to me but for some other lost child.

So, about me, well I've grown up! Yes! It happened so unexpectedly that I often tease that I'm still a kid at heart but I'm an adult now. I have a family too! Even married a pretty amazing person (nothing like my father). My job is forever stressful but completely worth it. I'm a helper like you were to me. 

Anyways, I wanted to touch base to let you know I'm alive. I'm headed out to a much needed family day but I'll be back. I promise this time.

XOXO

"My first post and probably last post of the year.
Finally the year has ended. 2019 was not a great year for me. But I am glad and blessed it was not that bad either.
It started with a trip. Followed by a breakup. Breakup would be the incorrect word but the effect on me was as much as a real breakup. It happened on 12.02.2019.
Good 1.5 yrs of friendship ended that day because i fell in love with her. My fault. Not a single day passed when I did not think of her. Anyway, i was strong enough not to msg her after that day.

Had a very important exam in November which would decide my career path altogether. Goofed up in the exam. Lack of strategy. Something I realized during the process- Trust your intuition. The sub conscious knows it.
The combination of intuition but reluctance to do it means that is the need of the hour. Today I also realized how the brain fools us. I realized that i missed her only because my brain wanted fucking dopamine rush.I am mow reading about channelizing what gives your brain dopmaine rush"

Song of the Day: Into the Unknown 

I got into college! I got into my ED school. I feel so happy and thrilled for that. It’s been amazing all week knowing I’m going to school. 

Otherwise this week sorta sucked. School really laid it on hard because it was the week before break. Now it’s break tho. My older brothers are all back in town. My gf has been sick with a high fever and I’m afraid she’s gonna get me sick. 

Last night I went to a party. I got really drunk and helped my friend hu with a girl. I like being drunk. My gf doesn’t like it when I drink. Not because I change, but Bc she finds it weird. Even tho she does."
"I cling to Jesus as I heal.  Can't share this journal with the Christian forums because it's ""too dark"".  So I'll share it here. I suppose, where it belongs for now.  Wrote this in my journal last night. Poured from my soul.

I'm exactly the slut you want to handle. 
I'm the whore you long to explore. 


""I am empty fill me up."", my eyes beg your instruction. 


""You're my world."", I say to you. 


Possess me, take me, make me yours. I'm your happy rainbow whore. Muck me up, make me dirty. Bat my eyes, nice and flirty. Slut me up, fill my cup. No will to fight, Buttercup. 


Stolen me, identity. Who was I? I'm not me. 
Find them, find them in a room. Predators to consume. Find the clever one who craves, little girls that behave. Grooms me, pets me, makes me coy. Introduce the little boy. 



""Does it feel good?""
Makes me laugh. Fuzzy headed. Backwards bath. 
Darkness darkness did consume. Taste of joy. In my room. 


""Wretched wretched ugly mess. Speak the truth! Do confess! You are No One!""


She does declare, raised hand in the air.
""Alone alone I am alone. I have no one."" 
Have no home. Empty brittle and afraid. No one no one to dismay. I'm a bird, I fly away.


Jesus there, inside my head. Holy He, I'm not dead. Hidden secrets. Gross desire. Memory filth, outrageous liar. Amnesia heals, granted me. Empty still, come and see.


Flying then, in deep blue space.  Searching blindly for God's grace.  Weightless, weightless, floating feather, flighty like a bird. Imagination, hallucination. Perfectly absurd. 



Faith instilled, tiny child. Burn ye bright, bold and wild. Darkness travels yonder path. Learn to dance, sing and laugh. Cleansed ye be, in Holy fire. Holy form to transpire. Grow will she, in godly form. Towards the Son, to transform. 


""She be like Him! The Holy Son! She has His Light! His Holy Fire!""

 Fury, rage, joy and love. Holy Fire from above. There is a well, a murky pit. Empty she, all of it. Holy Spirit, Holy Fire, Holiness does inspire.

"Dear Diary

This is, without a doubt, the hardest year I've faced in my many decades in this miserable place called Earth.  2016 was hard, but I definately had a worse year than that one.

So, in a rare moment of optimism, I'm gonna be happy that the xmas season is upon us and not dread it like I usually do.  Hopefully that lasts longer than the five minutes it usually does when I decide this. 

Sotd: *Christmas Wrapping* by the Waitresses, if only because I love that jaunty beat."
"**Dear Reddit Diary,**

*Life has been going well until last night. I come home from school and show my mom something on my phone. She tried to grab my phone and swipe through it. I quickly grabbed it away and that made her want to look through more. I spend a lot of time on my phone, so I don't know what exactly is on it.*

>*Give me your phone and unlock it right now*

*I was not giving in. I was stretching my arm out to stop her from getting it. At last I gave in and ran up to my room. I was pacing back and forth. Scared of what might come next. I was trying to think of everything possible that was bad on my phone*. *I knew exactly what was on it. I knew exactly what she was going to see. I plan to keep what she seen to myself. A couple of hours go by and she comes into my room.*

>*you are not getting that fucking phone back*

*I stayed silent. She did not tell me what she seen on it, but whatever it was she was not happy. I can not help but feel that she no longer loves me. That all happened last night and  I still do not have my phone. I really want it back. Teens should not have their phone searched. It is the one piece of privacy. Don't expect a teen to have a perfectly clean phone. If you are one of the people out there who think the totally opposite, all I have to say is, ok boomer*

**update 1**

*this morning she brought it up in front of my step dad, and my 2 little brothers. she said she was ashamed to have such a disgusting daughter. she said I will never have my phone back. I feel like running away at this point.*"
"I've been pretty much at the end of my rope for a while. Some days are better than others, my last diary entry was more suicidal in nature. Not that anything significant has happened in my life to change anything positively. 

Husband and I were laying in bed, and I can tell he's got something on his mind so I ask him what's up and he says he's worried of my lack of direction in life. Coming from him who has never taken a risk in his entire life. Workes his ass off for peanuts and litterally spends more than half his life at his current job.

I've been wrestling with depression and my struggles to make art a living, as a nobody artist with the constant battle of me maybe wanting to just end it all.

Nevermind that I have no real world skills other than fast food work. I cannot and won't get a better job based on my resume skills alone. And standing out on a fucking sheet of paper is impossible but here I am."
"I’m not sure why I feel like dying. I have a nice house to sleep in and stay with my wonderful sister. I don’t know why things are starting to go downhill for me, but therapy doesn’t work. I feel worse. I’m worried that if things get as bad as before I’ll just kill myself, but that seems to be the only way for me to not feel the way I do. Cutting only gives me a temporary release. I’m not good enough to be here and I don’t deserve to be."
"A little tired of going in cycles, scrolling through reddit and instagram and pop culture news sites and online dating apps that I never actually commit to. Of using the internet (most specifically, my phone) to while the time away while I feel mentally blocked and a little stressed because I tend to get overwhelmed with Things To Do, even when it’s just a few, and look for ways to not feel that way, via internet and sometimes food. Tired of obsessing over self image and attention via social media posts that aren’t even my own - by a photo my friend posted of us on their account and I’m here obsessing over the likes because I Need to Know whether a guy I used to work with that for some reason is sometimes my Fantasy Crush (even though we didn’t even connect that way IRL) has seen it. Tired of a messy room, of junk mail that keeps coming, addressed to many individuals, because this is a family home, and for people that no longer claim this address. Of ignoring art assignments because I don’t know why, but something about art-making or the creative aspect is intimidating and I just put it off. Tired of unused gym memberships. Inability to throw  things out, even though I probably only use 5-10% of the things in my room - and don’t get me started on the garage. Tired of not being the person I’d want to date. I love myself, and in many ways, I am proud of myself and how far I’ve come, despite the tone of this entry (stress moment). But in ways, I view myself as not having the maturity, mental/psychological/emotional space, or healthy life habits that would help support a relationship. So although I feel a little late and a little older to romance, I also don’t feel it is something I’d want to pursue in this state. At the same time, there are occasional inklings of worry regarding not knowing how to kiss, knowing people are settling down already, and more. The stress of adding more body hair grooming to the list. The stress of taking a school ID pic without the haircut I’d prefer, because I am both lacking the energy to shave my (head) hair again these days, but also because I worry about my appearance and I worry I won’t look as good because my hair is a little overgrown, and I don’t know if I am satisfied with my weight / how my face looks in terms of face fat, and I don’t like this obsession with How I Look. In some ways, I am happier than I have been in the past few years, but I remember when there was a time of enough happiness or at least sense of self or life energy or purpose or meaningfulness / fulfillment that I knew I had gained weight, but I was still smiling brightly.

*I want to live more mindfully, to make sure I experience life more meaningfully. To make sure there are more moments and elements that are meaningful to me.* That means I have to take up the adventure and mission of figuring out what’s **Meaningful To Me.**

There was more stress that I wanted to voice, but I’ve forgotten now. So I think this is a good place to stop the post. Additions to be added via here or comments.

"Dear Reddit,

I had 20 minutes to kill after an AA meeting but before my Uber showed up today, so I started looking into hard numbers about AA. Turns out, there's no hard evidence that AA works better than other methods, and my craving/obsession/need to drink went away while I was in therapy.

Yeah, sure, AA was the pinnacle of arresting chronic alcoholics 85 years ago, but there's modern medicine now.

So I talked with my nurse about it, and he said it would be good for me to talk with my psychiatrist about medications for if I feel the urge to drink again. 

I've just found it so weird that everyone is focused on what it used to be like while drinking, like they've been frozen in time. One day at a time is fine and dandy for getting through the thick of the withdrawals, but what about dreams and aspirations?!"
"My first time going to a rave today and I'm almost 27. Should I have done this sooner? Probably, but I'm doing it now so there's no regrets. Will it be fun? Most likely, one of my old friends is playing there so I'm going in with him and he's got all the hookups to whatever I want. Molly? Check. Coke? Check. Alcohol? Fucking triple check.

It'll be my first time trying either molly and coke so it'll be a night to remember. Sad thing is I got work tomorrow and idk how I'm gonna get there.

But that's a problem for tomorrow me.

Just wish you were there to try this new crazy shit with me."
"It’s been 3 weeks since my husband left on a 2 month “trial separation/trip to find himself”. Today I’ve been more angry than normal. He called me 2 days ago to talk about his sister and how he offered to let her move in if she needs and how he told his family what was going on with “us”. All I can think now is, “Excuse me? YOU don’t have a place. YOU quit your job. YOU left. YOU said you don’t know if you want to be married anymore. YOU won’t go to a therapist. I never asked for any of this”. I want to call him and scream this at him. Tell him not to come back. But I won’t. Because I’m an idiot and still love him. Which is so dumb. Maybe during these two months I’ll grow a damn spine and tell him off. Probably won’t though."
"Today, as part of my journaling experience, in fact this whole week, I'm going to celebrate small acts as if they were great events. Today's minor major event is movies with my husband.

My husband and I try once a week, generally on Monday's, to watch a movie together as a couple. (I'm kind of running out of ideas for what movie so suggestions are welcome!). Today's movie is: Harvey. (It was my husband's idea). 

So, I'm going to surprise my husband by dressing up a bit, and trying to put together a bit of a snack for us.  Making this regular habit a bit more special."
"Woke up feeling fairly well-rested today. I’ve noticed that I tend to wake my boyfriend up a lot lately because I’m always up earlier than he is.

Ate a simple breakfast and made my French press coffee (boysenberry flavor today) before putting on my comfy clothes and taking a walk with Manny. I turned on *Crypt of the Necrodancer* to keep a good pace, and we walked inside the mall since it’s a bit hot and humid lately. I stopped by my old work and said hi to Gina.


I feel pretty good on days that I go walking I think the mix of exercise and getting out of the house helps with the symptoms of my depression.


Afterwards I tried to shower and scrub down as soon as I could, to help with the acne breakouts I’ve been getting on my back.


I made a new recipe in my skillet for lunch: honey balsamic chicken with broccoli and brown rice on the side. It was tangy and filling and relatively healthy! Manny really liked it, too.


As a note, I think this is helping me drop a little weight; I went down about 3 lbs since I last weighed myself.


I’ve been toying with the idea of going back to school to get training for an administrative/desk job. Having a degree and classes in computer software could look really good to a potential employer, and I could have more of a choice in job listings.


Manny went to work so I took a nap for about 45 minutes. I got a call from a debt collection agency about credit cards I don’t remember. I’m gonna be looking into it, because it sounds like old credit cards my mother may have opened in my name, considering the information they had.


I chatted with friends for a few hours on Discord and beat *Cadence of Hyrule*. I looked into financial aid options and was told I could just walk into the school offices without an appointment.


Grams had a very definite moment of dementia tonight around 7:30pm. She’d been taking a nap on the couch when she woke up thinking it was 7:30am. She kept asking where Manny was (he was still at work). Not sure what to do about it, but she must have asked me 3 separate times despite me telling her it was nighttime and she’d SEEN Manny leave for work a few hours earlier..."
"So staying at my bf's house has been okay so far. I like his family, especially his youngest brother. But there are always two sides. I think maybe it's important to me to be able to do whatever I want. The small things like being able to buy my own food, put stuff where I want to put it, go to bed when I want to. It's like I always have to choose between being free and not being terribly lonely, like there is no ideal living situation. 

So instead of studying for my exams, I have been thinking about life a lot and made some realisations. Like for example, how I tend to become friends with someone, like really close friends and hanging out with them everyday. But only realising after quite a while that they make negative comments about my behaviour and don't accept me for who I am. And then, when the friendship has come a long way and they see me as an important person in their lives, I suddenly decide that I don't like that friendship and completely ghost them. This has happened at least 4 times in the 20 years that I have lived. I know that Alison is one of those friends, and I have no idea why she still wants to hang out with me. I think we shouldn't have become friends in the first place. We were both just so alone during the first months we lived in this country. We related to each other because we felt at home in each others company. I liked hanging out with her because (I thought) she accepted me for who I was, because she didn't judge. But as it turns out, she was just shy. When that shyness faded, I got to know more and more of her and I did not like it. Not to say that she is an inherently bad person, we just expect different things from the people around us. We did help each other in the first year here, but we should have left it at that. The whole ""living together"" situation did neither of us good. 

It has now been a full year since I have left our apartment, and how things have changed. After I left, I felt very bad about myself for so long.  The things she had said had such an impact on me. I genuinely thought that I was a bad person, not being capable of doing any good for others. But lately this has changed. I found friends that I am really happy with. I gained more and more confidence. Although life is still hard sometimes, I am content knowing that I have grown."
"I kept it quiet—a secret for a year. I thought of keeping it to my grave. I had thought of removing it before the secret is no longer a secret. 

I couldn’t do it and so I kept it hidden in my sewing fabric box for months. I thought it was safe since no one else bother to go through my craft materials.

Well...🙄

You see, I came home from a tiring day of work and dealing with my car’s issue to meet face to face with the very thing I wanna keep a secret. In the mist of taking off my top I froze and zoomed in on my desk, trying to understand what was wrong with the image I was seeing. It took me a moment to realize the anomaly. The object of my pleasure was sitting on my desk, a desk that was usually the last thing I looked at when I came home. 

My mind was racing—how long has it been out like this on display? Who had seen it? 

My sister, 13 at this time, was laying on my bed. I casually took of my shirt and covered the top of my desk and started a conversation to abstract as much information as possible of who went into my craft and fabric box, “Is Thomas home?”

“I don’t know”

I changed my pant and acted like usual. We laughed before I sneaked the object of my pleasure, wrapped in my shirt, with me as I headed to the bathroom (BR in my room).

On the toilet, trying to calm down when my sister yelled: “did you take that with you?”

“So?” I yelled back.

“Ewwuu, you’re nasty!”

“So? What I do with it, is my own business!”

She laughed. 

I came out of the bathroom and asked again, “Was Thomas home when you came home?”

“I don’t know”

I was fixated on Thomas because in the family he’s the biggest bully and I was the person who usually stand up to him. If he knew this secret-no-longer-a-secret he would drill the embarrassment into my very soul. He would be so loud, the entire world would hear. 

—10 minutes—
I laid on the my bed and distracted myself with my phone. My sister came over, “what’s that white thing?”

“You’ll know when you grow up”

“I think I know what it is”

“Oh,” I said teasingly and mind my own business as she told me about what she saw in class. Someone drew the big D, you know a man’s part, or at least someone wrote the big D on a piece of paper and left it on the desk ahead of hers. 

“Why did you buy it?”

I gave her the same answer and returned to my phone trying to cut off the conversation. I really didn’t want any of the boys to walk in and start questioning. She has a big mouth. 

—30 minutes later—
 
I was feeling better and snooped around. 

“Did you go through my fabric? If any of my craft are missing you’re in big trouble,” I lied. I was just trying to connect the dots to figure who went through my stuff. 

“No, I don’t know,” my sister answered. But I saw a slight weirdness to her mouth. Is she lying? I pondered. 

—10 minutes later—

Thomas walked out of his room and headed to my bathroom. 

“You just came home?” I asked, snooping around. 

“No, I was home the entire day,” he said but didn’t mention anything odd. I guess I could check him off my did-he-know list. The biggest bully didn’t say anything. This only point to one answer, he didn’t see it either.

—

Sigh.

I had a very bad dream this morning. I willingly cradle a baby in my dream and usually cradling a baby in my culture meant bad news, illness, or omen. I guess it was referring to this. 

Now my sister is threatening she will tell Thomas. 😭 and I don’t even know who went through my stuff. I guess it was she? 

My mom was the only other person who would go through my things. She also sew too, but her project was completed three days ago. What business would she have going through my fabric box. She knew she couldn’t go using my fabric as she please. If she was looking for sewing tools, it wouldn’t be my fabric box. 

When I came home, we talked normally. There no mention of anything. If it had been her and she could recognize my object of pleasure, she would have drag me somewhere for a talk. 

I’m still worry. 😫

—In the evening—

My mom and I were in the living room just cleaning up stuff. Nothing seen off about her behavior. We talked like usual. Nothing off. It seemed she didn’t know. 

So who took out my object of pleasure? 

I thought of my other brother, Tim. But Tim wouldn’t have gone through my fabric box. Even if he did, he wouldn’t take my object of pleasure. He would have left it where it was found or so I believed. Why would he take it out and put it on my desk? It didn’t sound like Tim to do that. Plus, my conversation with him was pretty normal. He didn’t mention anything, even if he had saw it on my desk. 

I’m starting to think 🤔 it was my little sister. But why would she go through my fabric box? What would compel her to do so? Even go so far as to take my object of pleasure out from its hiding spot? It was not her style to take something like that and put it out. But she had lied before and had taken things out when she wasn’t supposed to. But there were also times she would leave thing as they were and would come ask me later about them. 

Since she was the only one who asked me about it, I’m starting to think she took it out. Now is she an idiot? If she could even get the hint of what it is—why take it out? She knew how to ewww, so how could she not know to leave it where it was? 

I’m having more questions than answer. I’m going to have to snoop around some more. She could betray me which she had done before. Sigh. I stood up for her when Thomas bullied her, but I couldn’t trust her to shut up because she had a big mouth sometimes."
"There are days when i feel like writing essays here that would go on and on and on some days, I struggle to put together two thoughts that would make any kind of sense in the general order of things. Like a prisoner trapped in a cell, I am crossing out the months this year. Maybe it's nothing, maybe I am just imagining it all, maybe it's the best year of my life, but it doesn't feel alright. Something feels off. Like the minute hand of a watch that just doesn't align at the numbers properly. A tune in a slightly different key. The rat in the back of your head, grinning like a clown because it knows that it has you dead to rights when it starts to dig. 

If I look at different areas of my life, things are pretty okay. It's all good. But hitting another birthday does something to you. Like reaching a half-way mark in life. That's how many years you have spent on this planet and you have an almost equal number of years left here. So, what are you going to do? It's a really fucking scary thing to realize that you have not achieved your dreams in all these years and your life has been really fucking boring, to say the least. That you could never break out of the frog in the well mental state because you never got that kind of exposure, and you never interacted with that level of people who are doing all the things that you want to do. It hurts. I distance myself from social media because even if these people are posting the highlight reel of their life and even if they have a lot of issues and pains behind the scenes, fuck, man, their highlight reel looks bloody interesting too. 

And the bitch of the thing is that I know these globe-trotters and fun-having instragrammers might be having a horrible time behind the scenes, but fuck, I wanna do those things, too. I wanna see the Eiffel Tower. I want to see the cliffs at the seaside in Australia. I want to visit international rock concerts. I want to see the fucking sea. But I haven't done anything yet and in my head the clock is ticking. I wasted too much time and money thinking of others and I gave and gave and gave my time, money, attention, and my life to so many others without ever thinking about myself and all that time is gone and I am left with this crippling anxiety and a ticking clock in my head. 

Maybe this is what a mid-life crisis looks like. I don't know what the fuck I am going to do. But I am going to do something. "
"I work with a bunch of women in their 40s and 50s some older than, most twice my age. One of the younger ladies 40ish, let’s call her Anna, was talking and said that she likes the smell of fresh asphalt. While another lady who is 45 I think, thought Anna said she likes the smell of fresh asshole. Those of us around start laughing at the situation. After a minute or two I asked what fresh asshole might smell like. That when Anna says “it smells like a freshly tossed salad.” Compliantly strait face. That’s when we all lost it. It has been the funniest conversation I have had at work in months."
"It has been a while since my last confession. lol. well i'm kind of shaky today. fell off the wagon. going to get back on today. This time I'm taking a really long break. Not going to really think about it, just take it one day at a time. Challenge myself to see how long I can go for. Pretty much want to go the rest of the year, then re-evaluate. I'm thinking if i can do that I will be in the best place I've been in since my teenage years. Everyday is a battle. One day at a time. grow. progress. love myself. 

Here's to me figuring out who i am..."
"I am an Industrial Engineering student and for almost 8 years in college, I am now on my last 6 months (1 semester) in college. I can't wait to wear my toga and make my parents proud.

Thank you, God for all the nonstop blessings that you've given me."
"Last night, I thought there was an intruder in my home. I woke up from a startle at around 2 o'clock in the morning. I thought maybe it was some tweaker or crackhead pounding at my door. Nope, nothing. I checked my basement and still nothing. Christ, I think I'm going insane. I didn't get any good sleep, so I just decided to call in sick for today.

Thing is, I don't believe it was an actual sound that woke me up from my slumber. This is gonna sound crazy, but I thought I heard the sounds coming from dreams I had last night. But, shit, I can't remember any of them. Ugh, I've made this sound more confusing than it should be. Basically, I had a nightmare...several of them. And I think one or some of them had disturbing noises that jolted me awake and left me in a cold sweat. And, in my hallucination, I thought I heard those same sounds coming from within my home.

That reminds me of a story one of my friends told me back in high school, but I'm certain he's full of shit. He told me he was sleeping on the 2nd floor of his house and when he opened his eyes the next morning, he saw, briefly, a shadowy, clothed figure floating by his window just staring at him. He told me he didn't bother going to school that day, saying it was a ""bad omen"". I'm pretty sure his eyes were playing tricks on him. Yeah, I'm not a believer in the paranormal or anything supernatural for that matter. But, hey, if you wanna believe in that stuff, go ahead. They make for good stories, though.

Some people have told me they've seen apparitions walk right through them in their own homes. Others have said they've communicated with things from the ""other side"" they shouldn't have. Yeah, things like demonic entities, stuff like that. A guy I used to work with at my old repair shop said he used an Ouija board, which is basically a board with words and numbers on it to communicate with the dead. He told me him and his buddy used it one time in their house and, supposedly, the spirit of a dead little girl contacted them. But during their seance, a bunch of stuff in his house started to break and they fled the room. He claims his house started to stink of rotten flesh ever since.

I don't believe in any of that stuff. The only demons and monsters and other things that go bump in the night that I know of are other people...nasty, nasty people."
"I've been up since 3am thinking about you. I'm so tired but my mind is racing with memories of you. When we first got together you told me that you might not be ready for a relationship yet and that you might need space at some point. This was okay. I was ready to wait. I told you over and over to take the time you needed and I would still be here but you never left.

Then when you needed space it was a lot. 1000 miles. A break up. You said you couldn't grow as an individual while being with me. That hurt. You called me a nihilist. That hurt too. I wish you would've taken the time you needed before getting into it with me. Even if that would've meant us not being together at all.

I miss the feeling of rubbing your neck and your hands in mine. I desperately miss falling asleep and waking up with you. I miss the life we had and the life we planned.

I just miss you and wish things were different. "
"From afar he appears to be enormous. As he approaches me with all authority I watch him grow smaller and smaller. The closer he gets the smaller he seems to shrink. Once he is within arm's reach (size of a toddler) he leans forward to touch my shoe and he shrinks to the size *of* my shoe. 

He stares at me defiantly and I take one step back as I watch him gear up to try to touch my shoe *again*. 

I realize now that he was not, the closer he got to me, shrinking. *I was growing*, I grew to encompass the sky, like a night blanket with stars. 

I tell him, ""I am not for you."" 

I lift my foot from the Earth and join the rest of my body over all the Earth."
"Reckless in your fearlessness. Determined to know no boundaries. Constantly provoking, seeking out reactionary information. 

A continual seach to find the right buttons and toggles to control everyone around you. How absolutely exhausting. I hope you find peace and rest. 


You never trusted me, you trusted the control you held over me.  You cannot truly love what you do not trust.  What you loved about me was not me, you love how I made you feel and think.

I miss last night.

last night I went countdown with one of my best friends, after that we went to a harbour side to sit and getting everything out of our chests at midnight.

on our way we encountered some creepy people, I was so scared but he made me feel protected. we're safe but while we were running he tripped and hurt his elbow, it was bleeding like crazy.

I asked if he's doing ok, did he need any band-aids, but he insisted that he was doing fine and he didn't need any band-aids, even though he had some in his wallet.

I wanna help but I couldn't. I want to thank him for making me feel protected, but I don't know how. I'm worried. and I can't get him out of my head throughout the whole new year's day.

am I overreacting? am I crushing on him? who knows."
"I'm just going to write the first things that come to mind

So today I haven't done much, not sure why I'm writing a diary entry. I'm just bored I guess I'll try and make it interesting though. Today I woke up at 8:30 and checked my Clash of Clans, I used to think of it as a garbage pay to win game until I started playing it a week ago and so far it's pretty good but I might stop playing when the building times get ridiculous unless you spend money

Whatever we'll see

Anyways, after that... Oh! I forgot to set the scene! I'm Australian but I'm on holiday in Canada, so that's pretty awesome

Back to what I did after that, well I played videogames. Did that for like 2 hours while everyone else was waking up, I played soms heroes of storm and path of exile. I just started getting into path of exile but it's pretty fun. After that I went out with my family (my non-direct family live in Canada for some context and we are staying in their house) we got some food and spent some time buying groceries and some computer parts for my uncles computer

After that we came home and finished building his computer, that didn't take up much time so we started playing board games together and had some dinner so now I'm just sitting here at 8pm after finishing dinner waiting to see what happens next, will probably play more board games then have some dessert before we disperse into our bedrooms. The adults will probably go to sleep but me and my cousin will likely play videogames until 1 am or so then go to sleep.

I hope this was interesting to read I guess? I enjoyed writing it, have an excellent day."
"Work has been crazy.  Today I was told that the Vice President does not want me involved in the transactions.  She wants to give the responsibility to another group she manages.  I have no doubt that it had to do with the mistake on the last transaction.  This really pisses me off because I made decisions based on facts I had at the time!  It makes me want to find another job.  I feel like now I will never be able to get promoted in this company.  Negotiating these contracts was the one of the most fun parts of my job (besides the travel).  They want to take that away from me.  I am really frustrated right now.  My brain is split in two.  One side says that I should not be upset because I have a good job that for the most part I enjoy and have a good salary and benefits. It would not be the end of the world if I had to do this job for a few years. 

The other side sees all these other people not any better than me getting ahead in the company.  They are giving out promotions right and left and I am being passed over.  That's the part that makes me really angry and frustrated because it just does not seem fair.  I guess I am taking this too hard because I have always been a high performer.  All my reviews have been ""Exceeds Expectations"".  So, this just feels like a slap in the face. I feel like I am not being recognized.  A part of me wants to look for another job but I am really not sure I could get another job with the same salary and benefits and travel that I want.  That's a tall order. I guess at this point, I'll just keep my eyes and ears open and see what happens.  

Porsche Boss had a ""meeting"" with me to tell me that the vice president was not happy about a few things.  A few things???  First, I did not properly analyze the risk of a transaction I am working on and therefore made the wrong conclusions.  ARGH!!  I was told that the transaction was performing fine, so I made my decisions based on that information.  Come to find out, the transaction is expected to perform fine by the end of the year but for the moment needs to be babysat.  It really pissed me off that I was not given all the facts.  Lesson learned here is that I need to seek out the facts for myself and not rely on others to give them to me.

Then she was pissed that I was late to a meeting with people from outside the company.  I was double booked!!  I had two meetings at the same time.  I got there as soon as I could.  she was also pissed that I asked questions in the meeting that had already been covered.  Lesson learned here is that if I am going to be late to a meeting, I should not go.

Then she is pissed that I didn't take control of a conference call today.  Well, I was an invited guest.  It was not my call.  My purpose for being on the call was to listen...apparently not...her expectation was that I should hijack the call.  I wish I had known that!!

Oy!  What the hell?  I guess all I can do is learn from this and move on, but I really hate this kind of shit.  I hope Tuesday is better.  Now I'm looking forward to my Dallas trip even more than I was before.  I really just need to get out of the office. "
"I keep wondering if he's hanging out with other girls... I'm worried he's going to move on fast. He's such a likable person. He has so many friends. Someone's gonna snatch him up quick if he lets them.  

I don't know if he's still considering trying the relationship over again. I'm hopeful, but not convinced. He sent me a text today, saying he hoped my day was going well. I know he's been thinking of me. But I don't know if it's him missing me/contemplating taking me back, or if it is just him being worried that he hurt me too much.   

I don't want to be friends. He does. The only reason I'd wanna maintain contact is just in hopes of getting back together. Why would I wanna watch him move on? Why would I wanna stand next to him and not hold his hand? Why would I wanna look at his face and not kiss him? We were constantly touching in some way. How do I not do that?   

I went by his house on my way home from work (not stalking, he just lives right by me). He wasn't home. I wonder where he is.  

I want to hear from him... but I have to be patient.   

I was thinking of dropping his stuff off at his doorstep. I dunno if that's a good idea though. Sigh. I'm going insane. "
 I really can't handle anymore family death. I've lost someone every year since I started college. I just can't cry anymore. I can't even breathe right now. What the fuck. 
"Hey, Grandma. It was your birthday recently and I miss you. You went too young, I really wish I could have had a little longer with you. I just wanted to talk to you about something you said to me.

I know you were upset the day I packed up and left from next door over at my mom's house. I did it without a word. You knew it was bad over there, and though I wish you'd done more to help me, I don't really blame you for anything. I had to get out of there, though, in any way possible. So here I am now in California, living with my wonderful boyfriend.

You talked to me about this a year after I'd gone, in a straightforward sort of way. I told you honestly about everything that went on in that house, and your expression softened into something like regret and sorrow. You said you didn't blame me for leaving, but that I should get away from my boyfriend because you didn't think I really loved him.

I understood where you were coming from, Grandma. I didn't know whether or not I 100% was in love with this guy, either. So I stayed silent, knowing you meant that I should figure out a way towards truly being independent without relying on someone's help. I still agree with that sentiment. But...

I did end up falling in love with this guy. Living with him, I've learned to love myself, how to be angry and how to stand up for myself. I've learned that my dreams aren't frivolous or stupid, and that they are worth pursuing. I've learned that my character flaws are things that change over time, and maturity means acknowledging their existence and working around them. I've learned that when someone really loves you, they show it in all the little thoughtful things they do every day. They don't make you feel as if everything you say or do is wrong. They make you feel like you are worthwhile.

So, Grandma, you were wrong. But I don't think you would mind being wrong if you could see where I am now and how healthy and strong my personality has become. I miss you and I hope you're proud of me. I really do want to make you feel like you've left a good legacy behind."
"I'll keep this entry short. My boss is pissed off because he wants data, but he can't get that data because one of the scientists needs an item in order to run his assay. The problem? I ordered it seven days ago and it still hasn't arrived, because it's on back-order. 

I was the one who ordered the item, but he keeps hounding me about it. I really don't know what my boss expects. I'm not a wizard; I can't make the item materialize. He says our collaborators are getting nervous because they want their data now. Yeah? Too fucking bad. Tomorrow, he can explain to them that vendors can't magically grant us our materials just because. Hell, if they don't like the answer, I can explain it to them. If an item is on back-order, it means **it's on back-order**.

The only company that sells this product, as far as I know, is a large science company that I loathe. I won't name them, but they've been gobbling up smaller science companies and jacking up the price of their products over the years. The quantity of their services and goods go up, but the quality of them goes down--*way* down.

Want to know something funny? My boss emails me tonight and asks me if I could directly call one of the other companies for this similar item. Guess what? That company was purchased by the very same larger company I'm talking about. Unbelievable.

There's absolutely nothing I can do at this point. I've exhausted all options, unless he can think of one. Otherwise, we just need to wait until next week. Tough.

The scientist responsible for running this assay needs to explain to the Professor why this isn't possible at the moment. I really don't want to put up with any attitude he's going to give over the next few days, all because a vendor had an item on back-order that we didn't know about.

Whatever, I don't get paid enough for this shit anyway. 

Can't wait to leave here for something, hopefully, better."
"I feel so shy when I have to talk to people with authority, despite them being super nice. And I hate this about me because it honestly makes me so uncomfortable. I want to swallow myself when I talk to people. I want to melt into a puddle and evaporate. The shyness is unbearable. And due to my job nature, I’m always talking in my second language, while the person I’m talking with is speaking in their mother tongue. This messes up my mind so bad, my brain cannot flow like it would in a normal conversation, it’s juggling all these tasks, which word to say, how to sound polite, how to not be awkward, how to be sensitive, how to say what I actually want to say. It’s like talking to my crush, it’s god damn nerve wracking, only this time it’s not my crush, it’s my boss and my seniors and my supervisors. I don’t know what made me this way but hell does this personality trait feel like a torture."
"I did it.
I did it again.
In a heartbeat.
With a sigh.

Without a thought...

It's so scary.
I thought that I will never do it again.
But the act is so overwhelming,
it's pressuring me up inside.

The guilt after
the pleasure is too unbearable,
that it makes me sick.
It makes me cower.

Minus point for the above,
Plus point for the below.

I'm the victim 
of my own crime.

Someday I'll be out
of this prison cell.
And all of this will be outdone.

I will not lose to you,
I will finish strong.

Again, I'm sorry."
"I feel anxious all the time and I'm not sure why I do. I think I'm just collapsing mentally at this rate. I'm just going to pour out my thoughts here.

My parents have been very nice to me recently though, and that makes me very happy. 

I'm planning a cool surprise for my fiance as well. I hope itll turn out well.

I miss my best friend.

I wish I could finally get the courage to write a story in the writing prompts sub. I'm too scared. 

I feel agitated for no reason."
"Dear diary,

Heh. You woke up this morning and didn’t say anything to me for several hours. You went outside and spoke with the tree guys and fiddled with the explorer G “gave” us. You got it running and then came inside asking where the paperwork was, all cheerful as if nothing was wrong between us. You also asked if I wanted to run to the gas station with you to fill it up. I responded by saying I didn’t feel like leaving the house at the moment but I would look for the paperwork. After searching through several drawers, I found the paperwork and handed it to you. You waited around for a bit and then asked when I would be ready to leave. I really didn’t want to go, but I said I would get ready right then so we could go. I was confused by your change of attitude towards me from the previous couple of days, but I hoped you wanted to talk on the drive. We drove in silence the whole entire time. What did you expect me to say? I wanted so badly to talk about why you were upset with me, but I knew if I brought it up it would only make you angry. So we sat in silence.

When we got back home, you continued to spend time outside with the tree workers for a couple hours and then came inside and politely let me know we would all need to go outside when they topped it. You then fell asleep because you had been drinking since the morning. We all went outside when they knocked and woke you up. You made a few comments to the kids, but they were uninterested and didn’t listen to you much. When the tree was down, we all went inside while you hung out with the tree guys and smoked dabs with them.

When they left, you came in and napped again while I made dinner. At one point you woke up and saw me on my phone and asked if I was enjoying it. I found a new game today that is number and color related and actually makes me use my brain, something I haven’t been able to do much since this pandemic, and I tried telling you about it but you were uninterested. You think I’m always on my phone and doing nothing else. Funny thing is, I really like to clean when you’re passed out because I know you probably won’t get upset at me about it then. So I’ve been cleaning a bunch the last few days while you’ve been drinking and sleeping. I know, you haven’t noticed.

I hope we can talk about why you were mad, but most likely you’ll want to just pretend the last few days never happened. My problem is that I’m such a sucker for our good times that I’ll probably move on without fully addressing the situation. I hope you continue working on yourself and that we get better at communicating with each other. I really love you."
"9:30pm 

     This is my first entry so it might be a bunch of word vomit. I’m a terrible writer, but it’s for me to look back on eventually. 

     Lately I’ve been feeling myself slip. I don’t know if it’s me going back into a depression state or if it’s something more. I have been so angry for so many reasons in all aspects of my life. From my skin, to my weight, to my job, to school. To literally everything. 

     I have had so many years taken from me because of my skin. I had terrible acne as a kid and being a kid I was dumb. So I picked and I picked and I picked. So many turned in terrible scars. I’m angry at my young self because I should have just stopped picking. I’m angry because it’s going to cost thousands of dollars to try and get it back to what it was before and it will never be 100% which is what I want but I will mostly likely never achieve. On top of my scars from acne, I have let my weight get out of control. 250 pounds. Which has given me stretch marks. So many in so many different places. I can’t believe I let myself get to this weight. I’m genuinely shocked and angry. I want to blame someone else, blame them that it’s their fault that they let me eat all this food, not exercise, and sit on my butt to get like this. Even if I lose the weight then I could have to possibly of loose skin and then again I have to put out thousands of dollars to try and get back to before. Then again I’ll have a huge scar across my stomach that I don’t think I could emotionally handle. I don’t even think I’ll be able to lose the weight. I struggle each time and quit every single time. Again I want to blame someone else on why I quit, but it’s because it’s hard and Ive never had to do it before. So if I don’t do it perfect then why try? I’m just so goddamn angry. 

     My job recently did a full inventory count. It’s the first count that I have ever done. But I messed up. I messed up so much on the counts. I’m so angry at myself that I couldn’t be perfect and do it correctly. I keep trying to tell myself that “people make mistakes” but it isn’t working. My boss doesn’t seem too angry, but I’m angry. I’m angry at myself on why I could allow myself to make these simple mistakes. Just why? Why didn’t I slow down? Why didn’t I look more carefully? Why? 

     I’m 23. So many people from my high school class have graduated from college and I’m basically restarting because I found something that I would actually like to do. But every time I think about it anxiety comes out on I’ll be terrible at it. Electrical engineering. That’s hard. So hard that so many people quit all the time. People who are smarter than me. What makes me think that I will be able to do it? I can’t even count correctly. But I want it. I want it so bad. But I can just feel in my soul that I won’t be able to get through the program and I’ll never be able to work in the field that I want. Speaking of the field, every time I try to research about the field and what I could do in it. I find nothing. Just people saying that it’s hard and that it’s difficult. I sit there thinking “I know it’s hard. But what else can you give me. Anything on the field. Anything.” Plus, I don’t take full semesters because classes are too difficult for me. I don’t know if it’s me or my mom. I’ve never really taken a full semester. She’s never let me. She tells me it’s too much for me. I know I work while going to school. She might be right, it might also be because I’m not smart or good enough of perfect enough to handle everything thrown at me. 

     I’m so angry. Why can’t I be perfect? I know I shouldn’t, but I compare myself to other people every single day. I see them with perfect skin, have an amazing body, see them be smart enough to be able to handle anything, succeed in every aspect of their jobs. Why can’t I have that come to me just as easily? Why do I have to work so hard when others have it so easy in their life? I’m angry of having to work so hard every goddamn day of my life. I think I might be more angry that I don’t make myself work harder. To finally achieve that I want in life. To get myself where I want to be. I blame it on that I don’t know how or where to start, that might be part of it, but I need to force myself at some point to at least start. I’ll look dumb, I’ll make a fool of myself. But maybe one day I won’t. 

     I’m angry and I’m tired - I just hope one day I won’t be."
"So I went to school today, had a meeting with my project group-mates. One of them happen to be extremely introverted. He is so quiet, I don’t think I’ve ever met someone this quiet before. Especially given his age and experience, I would expect him to speak up more, but he doesn’t. He speaks so softly and I’m always amazed by how shy this guy can be. I don’t even know if he’s shy or it’s just his habit of not speaking up. And somehow his submissiveness made me more attracted to him, kind of makes him more intriguing, as if there’s so much for me to explore. I’ve talked to him one on one before, it wasn’t that bad. He was still quiet but he wasn’t awkward at all, it was comfortable talking to him. And I actually find him cute. I’m sure he doesn’t think the same way about me, he probably just sees me as a kid, which wouldn’t be a surprise, given that I was not born until he finished his bachelor studies. And also, I love his accent. And his eyes are so soft that it kinda melts my heart a little when I see him, it makes him that much more gentle than he already is. I could imagine myself in his arms, not too muscular but not weak either, and I could just look at him not talking for a whole day."
"Happy New Year! I still feel like the only thing that's changed is the calendar. The countdown was extremely lackluster. It felt so damned empty, but considering the pandemic, I guess it's not necessarily a bad thing. It felt even more weird seeing the ball-drop at NYC's Time Square look so dead, save for very few people.

My first Monday of the new year was awful. I wish I had good news, but the stress is getting back to me at work. One of my coworkers has been in a foul mood. It's the Doctor, and she's been butting heads with the Professor, our P.I. I'll spare the details, but it has to due with scheduling, management and research-related things. I try to keep out of it as much as possible, but I think she wants me to back her up on her stances. I'm getting sick of it. I just want to go in, do the job and go home and rest. Seriously, keep me out of ""work politics"". Plus, the boss is signing my paychecks, so I'm not going to complain to him anytime soon.

I got even worse news. A great deal of my family tested positive for the virus, though, thankfully, none of them have been symptomatic so far. I'm worried about my siblings and parents even more than ever. I know I'm not supposed to panic, and I won't, but this is still putting me on edge, and I'm putting myself at significant risk by going to work everyday.

I've already made my decision, speaking of work. I'm not coming back for another year. That's right: I'm jobhunting after this year, or, at least, towards the end of this year. My friends have advised me not to tell my boss about my plans until mid-summer. That seems fair, but I need to tell him eventually, and it'd be totally unprofessional and rude to just tell him abruptly at the end of the year that I'm bailing for another job. The previous scientist I was working closely with did that, unfortunately, so I got stuck with the Professor's anxiety breathing down my neck, where he thought I'd do the same.

It's risky to be jobhunting during these times, I know, but to be honest, the tasks I'm getting piled with and on top of all the other crap I've been doing, it's testing my nerves. The main focal point of all of this being my recent promotion. I finally got to see what my new paycheck looked like: a pathetic $3 increase. I won't say what my base pay is, but they may as well pay me in peanuts, if that's any indication on what I'm making.

Meanwhile, this new variant of the virus keeps cropping up, and now I'm afraid it'll be only a matter of time before it reaches here. I'm slated to get my vaccine either tomorrow or next week, but I don't know if this vaccine can protect me from this variant. Again, that stuff is out of my field.

I'll be honest, I don't feel happy. And, you know, all the while I'm getting hammered by my boss and my coworkers to do more and more and more. Each day, I look at my insufferable excuse of a paycheck, and then I take a look at my expenses, bills and loan I have to pay. It's starting to really get to me.

I'm sorry if this entry wasn't the rainbows and butterflies and cinnamon buns you may have thought it was going to be, if anyone's reading this. I was looking forward to the new year, and here it certainly is. But, from what I can tell, the number on the calendar is the only thing that's going to change right now. 

I try to keep politics out of my entries as much as I can, but what's happening in Washington right now is unbelievably embarrassing. You know exactly what and who I'm talking about. And on top of that, that other slimy greaseball blocked any chances for me and everyone else in this country in getting help--monetary help that people like me desperately need.

Sometimes I want to scream."
"Ayo! Ayo. Ayyyyyyyyo. Ayo?

So uh. 

What !! Is !! Up !! Lads !! And !! Non-lads !! Aka !! Lasses !!

Wow, 2021. Wow, fuck. I turn 20 this year. Wow, shit. That’s like, a bit of an intense age to be.

I just discovered this subreddit, forgive me if what I have to s a y is nonsensical—I’m tired.

Oh, and while I do ask for your forgiveness, I don’t mention my tiredness as a means by which to apologize for the lack of sense this meandering of words is making. No, I don’t apologize for that at all. In fact, I much prefer to write in this manner. It’s a truer reflection of how the thoughts are moving around in my head, and while it’s unpolished, writing as I think makes more sense to me than writing as I assume other people think.

So yeah, it’s my hope that this post, and any potential subsequent posts, make about as little sense as it and they do.

I also don’t have much to reflect on or say about today, it’s 4:45am in the time zone where I’m drafting this, and I think my drafting it serves more the purpose of beginning this year the way I want to live this year.

Intentional about the time I spend, doing what I think will lead to peak happiness.

In this moment, the above meandering procession of words is making me like mad happy yo. Like on a scale of 1-38 like a soolllllliiiiidddd 32, Jimbo.

But yeah, 4:45am. Very little to comment on, other than the fact that 2021, in its inevitable intensity, better be pretty fuckin’ infinite.

Jimbo, I know you’ll make it happen.

Amazing awaits,

Not Jimbo"
"It's been 6 months since I have graduated from college, and I still don't have a job.  I never did any internships because I didn't try hard enough to get one and now it's all coming back to kick my ass. The first couple of weeks after I graduated I was applying at least once a day while I tried studying for a certification exam as well as help my parents around the house. But slowly and surely, my studying habits were horrible (taking multiple days off, not studying enough in a day, not going deep enough into studying.). Basically, I started studying on and off, and eventually, I just decided to restart my studying.  I've been studying for about 3 months hardcore, and my test is set for the 13th of January.  I am depending on passing this exam because it is preferred on most entry-level applications and I feel like it would at least boost my resume to help with the absence of no internship experience. It's been so hard seeing everyone I was in class with continue their lives and get jobs, while I'm at home with my parents scraping pennies doing Doordash until I land a real job. I have trouble sleeping every night, anxious about ever getting a job. I went through a hard breakup this summer and that's still been eating away at my mind even though I try to pretend it's not there. My mom is COVID positive and she's not the healthiest so I'm scared of the worst-case scenario. 

&#x200B;

Unrelated, I've been thinking about death a lot. I would never commit suicide because I would never want my family to feel the pain of losing someone like that. But I do wonder if life is worth it. What happens when you die? Surely I wouldn't have to deal with all the problems I'm going through now. 

&#x200B;

Music has been helping a lot. I've gotten into rock and found out Radiohead has made some of the best music I have ever heard so I'm glad about discovering them for myself. Kid Cudi has been helping when I'm really down. I don't know what else to write about. Maybe in 3 months I will come back to this letter to myself and see how life is going. 

&#x200B;

Sincerely,

"I stole a bottle of champagne last night. Technically it was not stealing since everything he left undeclared could be mine if I wanted it, he said so. Luka comes first though, everything is hers, but she can not drink any more. So I decided the bottle was mine. It was technically stealing since I didn't tell anybody, not Ed nor Luka, I just slipped into the cellar late at night, wrapped it in a sweater and took it with me when I left. Ed has been looking for that particular bottle, I'm sure, we think very similarly, that's probably why we dislike each other, but I figured it might be in the cobweb ridden boxes under the shelves and got to it first, (have I mentioned how much my tolerance for spiders has increased this past year?).

I drank it with Victor later, got drunk and decided I was celebrating the end of grief, or at least the second phase of it. The first one, pre-grief, was sharp and slow, it lasted so long, cutting at me over and over, barely letting me function, confusing my senses and making my mind foggy. This second one was heavy, keeping me down on my bed, anger and remembrance. I don't know what post-grief will be, but I've been dreaming a lot, dreaming of hugging a dying body until it goes limp, of ghosts that know they are dead, of dinner tables filled with people that no longer sit together. At least It's all in the back of my mind now, it doesn't obstruct reality.

Had a fever of 103 two weeks ago, my body burned, my head pulsed and eating was very unpleasant, I tested positive for covid. This lasted for 5 days with my chest feeling worryingly heavy during the second and third. Nothing like an extra dose of memento mori to close the year.

Yours truly,

Agatha"
"Hey, Reddit diary. It's me again. Hullo! I think I'm gonna actually post entries daily.

Anyway, things didn't get any better. Being constantly ghosted in every single social media, mood getting even worse, mind getting even more foggy. In fact I think I just have been ghosted by a cute girl from Reddit I was talking to. sigh.

It's been quite some time since any little thing can get me angry. Sometimes my pets will start making noises and I'll growl at them. I have two puppies that apparently grew up too fast and their mother won't care for them as much as they want, and they'll start whining and screaming their lungs out. When I'm busy with other things or when I'm just trying to cope with my fucked up mind (more on this below), it makes me burn with hatred. And then I'll feel horrible about being angry at two cute puppies. It's hell.

I'll also answer really badly to people around me, either by giving an angry reply or by not even replying altogether. And naturally I'll feel shitty for doing this. It's like I'm getting drained just by the distressing thoughts that stream through my mind every time, and when someone or something tries to get my attention, it annoys me. I don't know a better way of putting it, hope it's understandable.

I mentioned my mind. usually I always had a hard time to focus and to put my thoughts together (guess I'm not low iq however since I always managed to be ahead of people academically without putting actual efforts into studying -- not like I'm able to put any consistent efforts into studying anyway, but I digress), but nowadays it's way worse. It's like I went full retard. Sometimes I can't even speak properly. I recall I was trying to explain my reasoning about a simple thing I did, and all I managed to do was babbling and going into tangents. Which reminds me of other painful thing.

I always, always struggled at expressing myself (it's worse now). I had to put up with each humiliating situation in my life... because I can't express myself at all. And this course led me to endure contact with a ""friend"" I barely talk to nowadays -- basically because he always seemed to think it was pretty fucking funny to fuck around with me, knowing I never had any actual answer to give. That's why I don't talk to him nowadays, but sometimes I'll catch myself thinking about it and it's not a nice feeling, at all.

And as every day, I remembered that girl who twice flirted with me and said that she adored and liked me just to forget I exist after a better looking guy started to respond to her. My sub-average looks really don't give me an easy time.

I fear I spent this whole journal entry going into tangents and being impossible to understand, but that's how my thoughts are. Thumbs up for anyone who managed to read everything to this point and understand what I'm trying so convey."
"Another day has passed. There are 2 and a half months until this year passes too. I'm a day closer to the end of the road. I'll be one year closer too soon. Time flew. Even though it passed so fast it's still hard finding strenght to go on. ""God why have you forsaken me?"""
"So, my sister and I made plans to hangout tomorrow. I'm also going to be staying at the ""A"" house until Monday. I guess we're on good terms, but I'm still going to be cautious.

Anyway, my mom came into my room to tell me that I need to do my missing work. She also said that I shouldn't have an excuse because ""nobody bothers me."" 

But that's literally one of the reasons why in depressed. I don't have anyone. I'm all alone.

I feel like nobody believes me. And that makes me so angry because I have literally shown so many obvious signs of depression without even knowing it. And my mom still doesn't believe me.

In 7th grade I:

1. Had very little motivation to do homework, so I had massive amounts of missing assignments.

2. Would randomly cry alone in my room.

3. Would only shower once a week due to lack of motivation.

4. Had a difficult time getting the motivation to get out of bed, so I would be late to school *every single day*

5. Would hide in the same oversized hoodie.

6. Would sometimes think about killing myself.

My mom knows about most of those things, yet she still doesn't believe me. What am I supposed to do?"
"I hated you, every single second. Every moment that has come and gone I have hated you. For as long as I remember I have hated you. Because you are the only person I have never loved. I gave all my love away, to everyone else. I never had enough love leftover for you. Myself. I realize that I gave everything away, all the love that I had to give to other people in this world. M, and M, and both of them left me. Taking that love, and throwing it away because at the end of it I wasn't good enough. At least not in their eyes. But all that did was leave nothing left for me. So from this moment on, from this day forward, I will love you, I will cherish every moment I get with you, because no matter what happens, it is me and you for the rest of our days. I love you. 

\-Love always,

J."
"So, I bit the bullet and decided to return to Canada. Given my resignation, and am in the process of sorting things out. Unfortunately, for every moment of excitement, I also have this overwhelming feeling of negativity and being utterly lost! Deciding to uproot myself, leaving a major part of my life behind, and making a huge jump is just overwhelming to each and every one of my senses. Then there's everything I need to leave behind, the people I've helped, and the people I'm in the process of helping. And the people I couldn't help...
I want to speak to someone and just be honest about my fears, my worries, my sadness, and everything. But I know that's not me... It's not in my nature. I need to remain being the rock so many need, to be happy and cheerful and the shoulder so many require. But occasionally I get this overwhelming feeling of guilt, this feeling that I just want to hold someone and let it all out, every bit and just release all that I need to. Not only that, but I'm starting to think I'm not a good person for the decisions I've made and the thoughts I've had. Like I'm the problem.
I dunno, just my mind is all over the place and I just need to voice it for a moment. I just need a moment to be the insecure and worried me. I feel like, if I could just do that, have that, be that, then I can go back to being the person everyone needs, the person so many deserve.
For me, I see so many insecure people, so many sad people, so many deserving people, and I know they need that strong ever confident person... And in my heart... I'm worried maybe I never was that person, or maybe I was but am no more...
I'll continue to be me, to help and be cheerful as they need, because those moments when they feel happy and express how they are finding what they need, it makes me forget all the bad stuff and makes everything worth it...
Gonna get some sleep. Been 2 days without more than an hour or two... Fingers crossed it sorts me out and makes the negativity go away... But then again, I think, maybe it'll just clarify and focus my negativity..."
"So, yesterday my oldest brother had some free time and he wanted to spend some time with me.

We decided to get boba and sit outside. After we finished our drinks he said that he needed to pass by target. I remembered that my algebra teacher said that we needed a calculator that could do fractions. He bought me the calculator, which I thanked him for.

Now, around 40 mins ago I went to ask my mom if she could cook some chicken. She said she was too tired, and she asked me how my brother went about buying me the calculator. Then she talked about my sister and brothers. I started to get nervous because I realized that we have both been alone for the past 20 mins which means my dad would be coming up the stairs any second. 

And I was right.

I honestly got a little pissed off because my dad doesn't trust my mom to be alone with me anymore, in fear that she would say bad things about him.

I went back to my room, and my dad followed after 10 mins. He closed the door, and started talking about how my sister was manipulated by my oldest brother, and he just wanted to make sure that my brother wasn't also manipulating me. Then he talked about how a 3rd person can ruin a relationship, and how he lost 2 friends because the college school admin was jealous of his high gpa, so they told his 2 friends about it.
 

And then he had the audacity to say that he doesn't think that my oldest brother isn't a bad person, after talking so much shit about him.

Also, I decided that if I do have a wedding one day then I do not want my dad to be there, *especially* after what he did at my other brothers wedding.

(9:55 pm) Update: Well, my parents are yelling at each other once again.

My parents were talking for a couple hours straight, then my mom comes out of her room and tells me that I have a choice: to stay or to go to the ""A"" house. Before she could finish her sentence my dad started begging her to not do this to him.

I would choose to leave but I have online live classes, so leaving isn't an option."
"Today was a slower day at work, but that doesn't mean it was less stressful. The type of work is completely different than Starbucks, but it still is fun. I think at some points it is more fun than my previous job. At other points it is more stressful in the sense that there is much less structure and there is less people to talk too. 

I decided to splurge and treat myself today. I bought my first automatic watch and I also bought a cologne I have been looking at for a while. I really should save more money, but with the level of stress I have been having over the past few weeks and the way my mind has been coming up with a lot of bad thoughts it felt good to treat myself. I keep going back to my ex in my brain, but at least it's happening much less frequently. At least the bad thoughts come less often, so progress.

 I see all these people come through the mall, and each time I see a new face I hope that one of them will take my breath away. But I think that's the lesson I have learned from everything, nothing is going to happen in that romanticized way. I was talking with one of my closest friends here, and I told him that when I was dating her I thought about buying a ring. I thought about forever and how it would have been just that easy. He told me he felt that way too, exactly two times. I think that's why him and I are similar, we both romanticize life and love and everything in-between. It's just that I try to cover it up and act like I don't care or that I'm above that, but when in reality I am nothing but that romanticized lifestyle in my mind. 

Anyways, I feel tired. Not just tired from work, but instead a tired that comes from my soul. A tiredness that tells me that I am not where I should be and that I'm climbing towards a life that I don't know is best for me right now. All of this stress and all of this hurt and anger and pain and just pure destructiveness held back by a single thread of hope. A hope that I can be redeemed, a hope that tells me that I am not the person that I project myself to be or that I feel myself to be in everyday life. Instead that I am a kind person, a hope that I can be kinder. Instead that I am a person who deserves to be loved, a hope that I can love better. Instead a hope that I can be a person worthy of the love of a person that I love deeply. That one day I can get to the place I want to be, and be the person I hope that I can at least look back upon and say I lived a good life. 

Too many thoughts sometimes come to me at night. So I think I am going to sleep now. 

\-Love always,

J."
"Someone or a group of people, I suspect, have been throwing coffee or a dark-colored soda, like Coke, onto my car. This has been going on for 2 days now, with today being that 2nd day. Normally, I couldn't give a shit, but it's become childish and annoying, and it's a pain in the ass to wash off because it solidifies and becomes sticky.

It's not just me, though. Since these 2 days, there's another car that's parked next to mine that's been victim of the exact same treatment. I don't know if it's only a coincidence or maybe someone simply spilled their drink by accident, but the way the droplets formed on my car suggests that someone is doing it on purpose.

I have no idea who I pissed off or how, if anyone. But, in the event I did, I wish they would just stop. Seriously, I'm not upset, and I couldn't care less about the paint job. It's just that it's annoying to clean off, and on top of that, if this continues, I'm afraid whoever's behind this will move onto more serious things, such as slashing my or the other guy's tires. Maybe someone doesn't like my driving? I don't know. If it is being done purposely, I can only hope it's a case of mistaken identity, but now I'm speculating.

In the unlikely event that person or persons is/are reading this, and of course, if it's being done on purpose, I just want you to please stop. Really, I'm not angry. Thing is, while I'm not ticked off (too much) about it, the other owner next me might not take it as lightly. And that usually means involving the police, so think again before you end up eventually getting caught. If I pissed you off with my driving, too bad, but I don't think it warrants you to behave like a child.

I'm gonna see if it happens again tomorrow. If it does, I'm calling the cops, because the last thing I need is someone taking it to the next level: keying up the body of the car, damaging the windshield/windows, slashing the tires, vandalizing it, you know, stuff like that. If it really is purposeful, and they catch the party responsible, I don't want them punished. Just a warning will do, and nothing more. I literally have no time to be dealing with potential hooligans or potential irate motorists.

All in all, it's been a basic day.

Goodnight."
"This is a letter I wrote to my exboyfriend but I think all of us can agree that it’s better that I avoid contacting him.

Happy breakup anniversary to us. I’m fairly certain that’s not a thing, which sane person would keep track of their breakup or their misery? It’s been a year already huh, like what they say, time sure do fly fast.

A lot has happened since we broke up. I have been focusing on myself a lot and I did manage to achieve a lot of things over the year. I’m proud of myself but sometimes I don’t know if I’m doing those things as a distraction from this emptiness or loneliness. It beats sitting idly and thinking about you all the time.

I have been trying to get into the dating game again. I dated a couple of guys here and there but most of them are idiots really. There was this guy, he was so bad, he was dating me because I have a stable and promising career. He even said “You have a good and stable job, you’re the kind of person I wanna be with”. For most of our dates, he expected me to pay and became passive aggressive when I said we should split the bills.

The other guys I dated were just fine but really boring. I couldn’t connect with them and I wasn’t sure if it’s because most of the time I’m thinking about you and whether these guys are a replica of you. I wish I can stop trying to looking for a replacement but hey, I spent 5 years of my life with you. We were each other’s first love. I should stop trying to romanticise it.

I’m currently in the midst of doing my reservist, yea it’s insane to be doing that during this pandemic but hey, I have no say in that. There’s this guy in the class and he is pretty cute. He is a lawyer and works in the same office district I am, literally across my office. I had a chat about him with Sam and he said, he looks a lot like your exboyfriend doesn’t he? Oh wells. And also, he’s straight, we all know it never ends well for a gay guy to chase after a straight guy.

I don’t know if I have moved on from you or I am just really lonely. I no longer cry about you but I do miss our interactions. I miss having late night phone calls with you talking about our days and so on. Staying indoors has been tough, I have limited interactions with people and I guess it makes me feel really lonely. I’me excited for life to get back to normal so I can continue trying to date more people again.

I wonder if you think about me just as much as I think about you. It’s impossible not to think about you really. Every single place or word I go or come across will jolt memories of the past. Whenever those memories pop in my head, I try to acknowledge those period and those feelings and be grateful for those moments and let those thoughts naturally slide away. I’m not certain if that’s the most ideal way to handles things but I took that from the meditation practice I have been doing.

Anyway, I do miss you, interacting with you at least. I do hope we can still hangout someday, grab a coffee and just have a chat like we always do."
"I'm heading back to the lab on Monday! So, that means I'll be officially doing work on June 1. Finally! To be honest, I'm actually very anxious to get back. I hope I still remember how to work all the procedures. Nah, just kidding. And even if I do forget, my coworkers can help me, along with the numerous amount of protocols and SOPs we've written and have in the lab.

Speaking of which, this'll be my first procedure for an experiment I'll be conducting by myself. It's not the first time I've done stuff all on my own, but because I'm the only one (so far) who knows how to operate a specific instrument for this procedure, they're counting on me. So, no pressure, then.

I'll be fine. I'm mainly anxious because I'm certain the environment in both the lab and hospital has changed dramatically. Keeping a social distance in that environment is going to be a challenge, and since there're folks from other labs coming in and out, it's going to be all the more challenging. I can adapt--I *have* to--for the oncoming days. 

God dammit, this start of the new decade has been nothing but piss and vinegar. And, of course, this pandemic just had to arrive when I get an assignment to do all by myself. I'm hoping the Professor can lend me some assistance, but with this damned social distancing in place, and to account our limited lab space with many people in it, it's going to be difficult to coordinate in getting any hands-on help.

I'm the most inexperienced of our team, so I'm hoping the seniors can lend me a hand on this one. As for operating the instrument, I'm not too worried about that. The machine practically does the job for me, as it is semi-automated. I'm only worried about setting up the samples and diluting them. Dilution's important because having a highly concentrated sample will basically yield no results. Well, no readable results anyway.

I've been getting suggestions in doing either a simple 1:1 dilution, or to do a 1:5 dilution. Since none of this stuff has been tested before, I did ask help from a senior scientist, one who's worked with developing kits for these instruments. He's been nothing but helpful, though the only way to see if this'll work is by putting it to the test.

So, this is it: a new, phased beginning. I'm anxious more than anything, but it'll be something I can handle, step by step. 

Just need to take a deep breath and focus."
"It's 4 am. I'm thinking about him again. Earlier I daydreamed that we were dancing in a sun room over the water at the golden hour. He is golden to me, in all ways, like the sun. I yearn to be held by him and warmed by him. If only I could be with him in another universe. We might change history forever. Sir, if you ever need relief, I'm here for you. Please consider me, sir. I write about you and dream about you. If only you knew, if only you could know, or could have known. You're so comforting. I trust you so completely and it'll never be put to use."
"So, I just found out that my dad is in the ER. I knew that he was sick, but I didn't know that he was *that* sick. 

I'm going to be honest, I don't feel worried. Idk what I'm supposed to feel.

For my entire life I've been told terrible things about my dad, mainly by my sister. But, now that I know what my sister is like idk if anything she said is true.

Also, when my grandpa died my dad was complaining to my mom that he was sick, which I think was an attempt at getting attention. My mom was actually crying about this. 

My dad complained so much about feeling sick, to the point of nobody even believing him anymore. Like [that one time](https://www.reddit.com/r/DiaryOfARedditor/comments/fg50kv/real_3920_it_happened_again/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) when he had amnesia, I felt like I didnt believe him.

Idk what to think anymore."
"Hello there.

So I'm Katie.  At least, I want to be.  I'm a guy who for the past 38 years or so has wished he could be she.  Let me tell you, it's hell.

So why not transition?  Great question.  There was a time I wanted to.  There was even a time I was going to.  I don't recall the exact reasons, but I ended up backing away from it.  Good thing I did too, because a few years later I ended up meeting someone who did transition.  And then they detransitioned.  They were fairly unhappy as the opposite gender.  

That would be me.  I have an inherent unhappiness to me. I'm told that I would be happier if I did transition, but i know differently.

So I'm afraid there won't be much excitement here.  I want to use this space mostly to organize my thoughts on wanting to be feminine, and any crossdressing I will do.  

<3 katie"
"Dear Diary,

I live in a pretty large and well-known North-American City in Canada. I'm currently a medical student working in hospitals. I am a male in his mid-20s. I live alone in a 3 1/2 downtown. My parents live about a 20 minute drive from my apartment. Medical students have currently been pushed-out of hospitals, mostly for liability reasons.

As I am writing this, we are in the midst of the Coronavirus crisis. I struggle with anxiety and depression, so it has been quite a worry to me what I am going to do about all this free time. I feel scared that I won't be able to fill it adequately. I guess I put a lot of pressure on myself.

Yesterday, I went for a long jog. I downloaded an app called Strava which tracks your runs and compares them to your friends' runs, so you can support each other. I decided I would start going for these long runs and listen to Motivational Speeches on Spotify while I do it. This way I get motivated and I get some cardio and fresh air all at the same time.

I decided to start writing today. The thought occurred to me while I was going for the run.

""I wonder what people all across the world are up to right now"". I thought it would also be interesting to read other people's diaries from around the world.

This morning, I put on a Youtube video of a forest with bird sounds. I am sitting in front of this while typing away on my laptop. I had a good night sleep, and last night I stayed up late at night on the House Party App, with my friend Dylan and several of his friends.

Just a little bit about my boring life! Will come back with more,

mstories"
" Diary, 

Today is the first day of our Shelter-In-Place order in my state. My boyfriend (who lives out of state) got his around the same time. I got angry at him last night because I felt as though we were falling apart because we haven’t talked as much as we did before. It was the first time we talked on FaceTime in about a week. 

He promised, looking at my red tear-filled eyes over his phone, that I could get on him about talking over Facetime. Which is nice, because not being around him after living together in a tiny dorm room (in which I had no official roommate) is the hardest adjustment to make out of all of this. 

He may be a sweet guy, but sometimes you need to tell him what’s going on straight up so he can understand.

I actually turned 21 yesterday, but it feels like I haven’t yet. I guess it'll change when the world starts turning again. Despite aging a full year within one of the biggest global pandemics, it was a good day. 

Last night, at dinner, my father made a joke that the Governor of my state had gotten so scared of me turning 21 years old that he shut down all the bars in my state because of this. Maybe that was the case, but I still drank a lot anyways. 

My birthday wasn’t terrible as I thought it was going to be, it was actually quite nice despite being locked in the house. My stepmom (who she and I are having a hard time with other problems at the moment) left me the sweetest message on Facebook telling me she’ll do anything she can to make my birthday special. I’ll tell you, I nearly cried reading that on my timeline. I thanked her before I went to bed, and I’ll probably be thinking of other ways I can go around the house and help her out as a way to thank her. I feel so bad for what happened, I’m not going to go into it, but it was pretty bad. 

Dad got me a pen holder for all of my fountain pens, which really is helping out on the desk organizing front when it comes to doing classwork from home. Although, I really should be cleaning off the rest of my desk so I have more room for my school stuff and not just have everything close to the edge of my desk about to fall off. You know what they say, a clean hive is a clean mind. 

(I wish I could show you my room because I really need to clean it). 

After midnight yesterday, my friends had started calling me and texting me from midnight until 3:00 in the morning. I did shots with a friend of mine over Facetime and all of my friend group got on a group conference call to sing Happy Birthday to me (it was, might I add, very off-key, but I loved it anyway). I got so many calls and so many well-wishes that it really made that self-sabotaging part of myself go away for just the briefest of moments. 

I’m hoping that with these next 14 days of being at home (except to go to work, because apparently my non-grocery retail job is considered essential) I’ll be able to build a sense of self-discipline and structure through my online classes and daily routine. 

I never had this before. Really, I sucked at this before. I’ve been able to keep some sense of routine but that was always with the institution of Corporate America or Education keeping me in line. I guess, if I’m 21 now, I really should have a way to be self-sufficient and build that sense of daily tasks and schedules. 

I have a planner with a daily schedule bar, but I don’t seem to ever stick to it. The only thing I seem to markdown is when I’m going to work, have a new job interview or have online discussions for school. This isn’t the best, I really like the idea of blocking out time for things but I can never put it into practice.

I’m doing better. I really am. I’m starting to find my footing in such a troubling time and making the best out of such an awful situation. 

Everything around me seems catastrophic, right now. It seems as though everything that held the world we all lived in is slowly unwinding and loosening. I get frightened thinking about how far large institutions of government can take freedoms of us and we’ll be fine with it. I think about the worlds 1984, Fahrenheit 451 and The Handmaid’s Tale, now they don’t seem like stories anymore. 

But, I open my planner for the day. I look at the date and realize it’s not Judgement Day; it’s Tuesday. 

It’s just another Tuesday. 

Signed,

Bukowski (…Maybe)"
"Where the hell do I start? 

The hospital's gone into a ""level 4"" lock-down, meaning only staff and one healthy visitor for each patient are allowed inside, and even then you need an I.D. with you at all times.

The city's been more dead than ever. Ever. I've never seen it this empty in my life. Seriously, one of the largest and busiest cities in the world and it's come to a grinding halt because of this quarantine.

Everyone is going crazy at the lab. Multiple temporary shutdowns, and a bunch of staff have been confirmed with the virus. We have to close the lab on Friday, so only 2 scientists are allowed at a time from hereon out for a very limited time, and need to rotate the shifts. 

Everything's moving so fast, and it's confusing and scary. Never in my life would I have thought to be living in a global pandemic. I know there are things that are exaggerated about it, and I know humanity's been through much worse. But, regardless, the impact that this thing's made cannot be denied.

To be honest, I was pretty happy the city was empty and that traffic is virtually non-existent. Now, however, I'm starting to feel off. It feels wrong. It feels like a ghost town, and with all restaurants save for take-out places closed, social gatherings on the weekends have come to nothing.

I'm stressed out of my damned mind because of this. We're rushing now to finish up any procedure regarding our experimentation and other projects. And, I made a mistake today that pissed my coworker off to no end. 

This is such a mess. We're running around like headless chickens because this caught us on our blindside. We knew it was only a matter of time before the quarantine procedures made it here, but we didn't expect for it to be *this* bad. 

I'm worried about getting paid and supporting my family. My old man was asking me for money, and he's absolutely not the kind of person who likes to ask help. He's like a salty, old sailor, but he seemed so shameful when he asked me. I gave him the money. He's my father, after all, and he's raised me well, I should think so. He said he'll pay me back, but I insisted that he didn't. He insisted for me to ""shut the fuck up"" and that he would. Love you, dad.

I really don't want to go to work, but they need me more than ever now. I can't abandon my team. We have to keep pushing until Friday, and from there, I have no idea where we'll proceed. 

A nearby company tested their first prototype vaccine on a patient in an accelerated clinical trial, so let's hope this is the start of something good, but I expect it'll be at least a year or 18 months before we actually see anything to prevent this thing via (safe) vaccinations.

I'll try to keep these entries up to date as possible, but with so much going on, I've literally not enough time for sleep.

What a time to be alive."
It’s been 3 months since I moved back to korea from Philippines. I feel like I’ve wasted every second I have spent here. I had  to though because of the military training that I have to take. But because of Corona Virus I can’t take the physical examination which is a prerequisite for the training. Well in a legal matter I can take the training anytjme between 30. I could have continued my study in college. But now I see my friends way ahead. No one to be with. Quarantined with no purpose. Due to all the stress I masturbate almost all the time to free me from all the time i need to spend. I think I’ve done this for too long now I started balding in my crown and I’m just in my twenties. I lost my confidence in everything. How do I regain motivation to live my life again. i realized how important time is in life. Now I know the meaning of time is gold. As of today i downloaded an app for counting the days of me not masturbating for my health and maybe if my hair would grow back. Will keep updates maybe if I feel like sharing my life again.
"It was a really good weekend. I drove six hours to go see a friend near DC, to see the Bernie rally and holy shit was it a good time. I forgot how much those long drives give me life, how driving through the mountains reminds me that the world can be beautiful. Just getting out of the house for once was amazing, and I don't think I've slept as well as I did in the nearly four months I've been home now. Hopping the fence after the event- in heels- to get to the worst Mexican food we ever had was an adventure I hope I never forget.

It did give me a lot to think about. My friend and I lamented quite a bit on our old workplace- I still really want to go back. I would love to still be working on something I believed in, with people I loved. I think I largely liked it because it was my way of moving out on my own, staking my own claim on my life. Now I'm stuck, forgetting how to adult and keep moving forward as one should. But he also reminded me that I was still worth something, that it was bizarre to him that I didn't see what he sees in me. I really do wish at times he was my brother. He might feel he has enough siblings as it is but dammit, I really look up to him. 

I keep thinking about the love I have lost, those I have left behind me. I wish, often, that I could still reach out to some of those people- and I know I could, if I really wanted to, but that it would just hurt me in the end. I really do like the people I talk to now for the most part, L has been a truly good friend. I wonder truly sometimes if the others really have my best interests in mind, if one is just infatuated with me and really, I have no idea \*what\* the other is thinking of. The latter has reverted a great deal to what he was like when we first started talking three years ago. I can only wonder if it will last. 

I am just so... confused on what my next step should be. It feels like I have a variety of paths to choose from, but how do I know any of them will be right for me, when I thought I was following my dreams already? Nobody really tells you what to do when the dream is over, but I suppose the only step is to have another dream? I'll get there, I know it. It's just going to take some time. 

I do hate even telling myself the last sentence's cliches- I want to be honest with myself in how hopeless this all feels but what good is that going to do me? Nihilism never got me any progress."
"One year, six months, and twelve days. I am grateful :)

No drama - just things I gotta do. I don't wanna talk to this girl or that, or to go on a date. I'd rather wait for, you know, ""the one"". That doesn't work, so I make myself do the work.

Just like I made myself do the work today. I went to the gym, but I wanted to stay in bed. I went to visit my father, but I wanted to cut him out of my life months and months ago. I helped my brother, even though I wanted to ignore his needs, and I volunteered, even though I really just wanted to stay at home, eat, watch TV and masturbate.

And here we are it's 11:00 PM. I am grateful for the consciousness, for the patience, for the faith and belief and trust. I am grateful for my health and my interest in life. I am grateful for wanting to live and for the fact that I am clean."
"As the title of the entry states, I feel like crap. This entire week has been balls. Really, *really* balls. I need to see an ENT desperately, but I also want to continue working. I'm starting to get this weird dualism between me getting addicted to work, but at the same time I also am getting slightly burnt out. It's killing me. Okay, it's not that bad, I'm being too much of a drama queen, but my right ear is really pissing me off.

A lot of people are getting sick with the cold, which, I swear to God, we'd already moved past ""cold season"". On top of that, it looks like this COVID-19 is scaring a lot of people. Nearly every day I get memos from the top officials at my workplace regarding it. It is nice to get these updates, but they're almost always the same: ""The situation is becoming more and more fluid by the second; we're prepared to handle it; wash your hands; blah, blah, blah, thank you."" Our hospital is a fortress of the best minds in the world, and that especially includes virologists who're studying this thing, although they can't actually study the virus itself here. 

Viruses (most of them) are considered a level 4 biohazard, which is the highest safety designation you can give to biological specimens. Guys who work in those labs have to wear HAZMAT suits in order to perform their tasks. I can't even imagine that. It's cumbersome enough to work in a lab with just my coat or without it, but to wear something that bulky and hot must be insufferable. 

As far as I know, we don't have level 4 labs anywhere here. Something like that would have to be isolated from the general population, if there ever was a containment breach. But, anyway, I haven't been assigned to infection control duty, so I don't have to worry too much. I'm not a microbiologist or virologist, so this stuff is way beyond my league of understanding.

One thing is becoming more and more worrisome, though, is that the CDC is stating there is a high chance of this thing eventually spreading towards here. Hospitals are already filled with vulnerable people, which are patients, obviously, and that goes especially for ones who're immuno-compromised. If we're not ready for this, it'll become a breeding ground for easy incubation and infections.

Thank God for the weekend."
"Okay so I know none of you know me, but I needed to write this down. I'm doing it for two or three reasons:

1. I'm pretty sad rn and this helps me cope

2. Knowing I'm not alone with my issues has helped me and maybe someone is going through the same and they can see they're not alone and find people to talk to

3. I don't really feel like I have anyone close who I can talk to about this. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* COMMENTS ABOUT DEATH, SUICIDE AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AHEAD\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

\- My name is F., I'm 19 yo, I live in Spain, I'm a software engineering student and things have never felt quite right. 

I don't know when it all started. The earliest memories I have of my life are about me getting out of bed at night out of fear of some monster, and of my grandmother screaming at my mother in the hallway about some stuff I don't really remember, I just remember my mom crying a lot over that. My grandmother had dementia and some kind of paranoid schyzofrenia, that and the fact that she was a really conservative person and many other fact made my mom's life hard, since she didn't want my mom to study at all. Those thoughts have bothered me for a really long time, since I know those deeply affect my mother, who hasn't been able to find a job for quite some time, which isn't that much of a problem (my dad's job is stable and such), but she definitely feels like she's not worth enough, since that's also what her mother used to tell her, that she was basically worthless. I think she tries to cope with food. She isn't obese by any means, but age might make even the slightest of overweighs much worse. 

There's this other thing in my early life, I've never called it bullying but some people have told me it was; I was laughed at and humiliated througout most of my childhood, first for being too skinny, then for being kind of fat, then I got skinny again but I was older, but then I developed epilepsy and had to go pretty regularly to the hospital for micro-attacks, which had to be supervised by a neurogist, therefore I had to skip some classes quite some days. In spite of having medical proof of such visits, my teachers thought I was faking them, so this ""you're lazy"" mindset was kind of publicly worded amongst them, which in turn made my classmates laugh at me and call me such things. 

From there  I remember coming each if not most days home just to cry in my bedroom, feeling completely worthless, like I'd never achieve anything in life, like I was complete garbage. I remember having pretty disturbing feelings about both suicide (which I thought about almost every single day of that/those year/s, luckily enough I didn't do sh\*t) and killing those who laughed at me and threw my stuff around class just to piss me off. I got caught a few times by my mom trying to put big 17cm blade knifes into my schoolbag. I swear to god I wanted to kill them. Luckily I changed my school.

&#x200B;

\- At my new school I changed a lot. Things at first were kind of the same. There was this kid who I guess was trying to test me to see my breaking point. He laughed at me for having a YouTube channel and for asking a lot of stuff to the teachers out of curiousness. One day I snapped at a PE class and since I didn't want to punch him I just went outside and kicked the wall for a while. He came outside to say sorry and I told him I didn't have a problem with him but I just needed him to stop doing that and he did. After that we became closer friends, and since he was kid of a ""popular"" guy some other people started talking to me. Since I wanted to change my clothing style I started dressing more like them (in terms of pants at least, I started wearing skinny jeans and buying sneakers at around age 15ish). More people talking to me made me talk to more people, which kind of helped me boost my confidence.

&#x200B;

\- I've had two girlfriends. I've never made the decision to end a relationship myself. The first GF I had was at age 16. The next one at age 18 to 19. I loved them both and we still talk, since none of those relationships ended in a violent manner or anything like that. The reason I'm mentioning this is kid of simple. My last relationship lasted 9 months. We spent more than half a month on summer together in a great camping with her parents and some of their familie's friends doing sports such as canyoning etc. I felt really close to her, honestly, how couldn't I? Well the thing that kind of admitedly struck me and hurt me was how it all happened. We were supposed to see each other that one weekend at the end of August. She was going to come over to my home, so I bought some food to cook for both of us, some alcohol to drink, and I was preparing a big piece of cardboard with pics of us + some text I'd read her since we made 9 months together. The morning before that Sunday she told me she wasn't coming, since she wanted to end the relationship. It sounds abrupt but it's just how it's conveyed by the text like, it wasn't done with any bad manners or intent, as I said, it just ended, no one tried to hurt the other, in fact she kept asking me to go to the psychologist because she knew I wasn't having the greatest of time in my life (which I asked her too, since she ended up developing bulimia). Last time we talked was three days ago or so, she wanted to ask me how I was and just chat for a while, which we did; it was all nice and good.

Anyway, that left some kind of void inside of me which has made me kind of not be in a serious relationship for a while. I've had sex, for sure, I've kissed girls, for sure, I've said ""I care about you"", for sure, but not yet ""I love you"" since there's no girl that fits that standar yet. I know it's probably just a matter of time but I'm a bit concernded about how it all affected me, idk, I don't wanna be afraid of loving because it might end, since that's how life works and it wouldn't make any sense.

&#x200B;

\- Right now I'm a pretty confident person whose biggest fear is the feeling of loneliness, not in terms of romantic love but  in general. I've finished my exams and I'm on a small break from today (20th of Jan) to the 29th, and I don't really enjoy breaks because I never know what to do or who to call. I for sure have friends but I also like exploring new plans and so. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: My life story. Just post yours or your thoughts."
"Dear Teddy,

Please talk me out of this.

(Wait...First, Happy New Year and blah blah, you know all the good stuff.)

So last year, I mean like literally two days ago, I scheduled a much needed appointment with a podiatrist.

Look, Teddy, three months ago I started having problems with my toe. It would get swollen and then less swollen. It hurt sometimes to just wear socks. I chatted with some friends about it and they were so brutally honest with the procedure of how to get it fixed. Essentially, do it yourself. ""Embrace the pain and save money"". Then there were the others ""Get it done at the foot doctor. They will give you this painful shot and then take care of it"". 

PAINFUL SHOT! No thanks!


I decided I would ""embrace the pain"".... Well guess what it's been three months and it's worse than ever! A slight tap and I'm in tears. How will I face tomorrow?! Do I even need or want that toe? Why does it hurt so much even after soaking my foot. What am I doing wrong? What if there is a serious infection?! And I lied. I want my toe. I need my toe.

Maybe the needle isn't so bad. Maybe if I look away I wont cry. What if I take my new teddy bear with me? Would that be weird- A woman with a bear? (Don't worry this new bear isn't the same as you)... At least now I'll feel more obligated to get pedicures. I hate pedicures.. or do I? I don't even know anymore because it's been so long.

Tomorrow is a big day. I really hope I brave up and go to the appointment. I can't imagine another three months like this.


I should try and sleep while I still have ten toes on my feet.

Goodnight Teddy,

Aces"
"That feeling. That feeling when u know you don't have the ability to achieve something but still you try knowing that there are high chances you are going to fail. This is what I am going through. 

Sometimes it is very difficult to decide whether to keep trying or just quit. This is the last week of December. Once Jan starts, I will be again busy in my work schedule and ignore my exam preparation. Unable to understand how to cope with it.

Moreover, I feel like I have lost the ability or willingness to date any girl. I just dont feel like..chatting and meeting some random girl. Seems to be a waste of time. 

Just lost in the middle of nowhere"
"I’ve started to write this while in Dance.  Im sitting out because I’m too tired. I didn’t sleep last night. 

Song of the day: Death With Dignity 

I’m mad also because people said I had the worst game yesterday during Night League. Are you fucking kidding me? CS has 8 turnovers in 8 possessions. I shot 3’s only when we were down by 20 with 3 minutes left. Why CS is on the team I don’t understand. 

I still can’t get the ED school out of my head. I’ve been in a horrid mood all day because of that. I can’t think of anything else. I said, jokingly, that I’d want to get super drunk if I didn’t get in and my gf lost it. Said I was a 10 year old and dramatic and my situation wasn’t unique. I know all of that. I’m just sad. I’m not actually gonna get drunk when I get rejected. 

My toes hurt. 

Update during 7th period. It’s hard to imagine a scenario where I get in. A scenario keeps flying through my head where all I see is “we regret to inform you...” I know that’s what I’ll see tomorrow. I just have a pit in my stomach

Another update. It’s 7:33. I just played basketball at the gym of the school I applied to. I played against the students there. Sort of was funny. But mostly just to distract myself. My gf just yelled at me for forgetting I’m lucky and privileged to apply and have a chance of getting in. Also said I was passive aggressive. I should just distract myself. I’m watching ravens v jets now. Lamar Jackson just break the single season QB rushing record. Go him."
"I tried posting yesterday, my first post, but it didn’t work. 

I’m terrified. This weekend I hear if I got into my ED school. I hate seeing all these people posting on insta about getting into their colleges

My brothers all got into the ED school, but I don’t have the same grades. And I’ve never been as good as them. This is final proof if I don’t get in. I have other options. But this is my favorite by far. 

Fuck fuck fuck."
"Dear Diary.

Well that was an interesting weekend.  Don't know why I did that.  I think I know, but I understand my internal thought process about as much as a frog does chemistry.

So I've been thinking a lot about my dreams lately.  I'm not one to remember them a lot, but it does happen.  The question that was asked of me is what my emotions were during the dream.  So I've been paying a lot of attention to my emotions while dreaming, and it turns out I don't feel very many in the dream.  I'm sure that has some deep cosmic undertones that once I realize what it means will be earth shattering for me.  But maybe a dream is just a dream.

So sweet dreams, Diary.  I hope one of us has them.

SotD: *This Wild Darkness* by Moby"
"I feel sick. My heart and mind are at war. My heart makes me want to treat everyone kindly and my head is screaming fuck everyone. so this looks fucking insane because one minute im kissing peoples ass and the next im telling them to fuck off. all this back and fourth has me feeling really off. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I hate being nice to people then watch them turn the corner and laugh about me with their friends. most of the time they dont even have the respect to even go to a different room before they talk shit about me. They just do it in a sly way. I keep convincing myself that I'm just over analyzing shit and im not seeing reality cause of my mental illness but i constantly get confirmation for all these sick truths that i wish were ""just in my head"" today i drove a coworker home. i should have said no when he asked me. but i brought up how i hate being kind to people then watch them laugh at me. you know what this fucker says to me after i told him that? he goes.. ""YOU KNOW????"" all surprised. I just wanna say fuck you to all the cunts who talk shit and crack jokes about me. How do you laugh at someone who is already down or someone battling mental illness? another huge fuck you to to all the people who laughed along or didnt say shit to shut them up. Then i thought to myself, dude that applies to you too. you know they talk shit to you why dont you say shit to shut them up? why do you just laugh along? are you not doing the same thing as the bystanders? im just as guilty. so fuck me too. but today this ends i will no longer be a bystander. if i witness someone talking shit on god ill say something. I will not continue being a bystander. I will stop it when i see it. in this war against my heart and mind i hope my mind wins."

Day 4 10/20/19 0441

Hello

*I moved my journal from* [r/NoFap](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/) *to here because it is more appropriate.*

&#x200B;

A little background:

My posts titles revolve around hiking because I like to hike and I feel it distinguishes me from the other logs

I am an eagle scout and I am in college 

I have anxiety and are prone to pushing away people who want to help me emotionally

That is it :)

&#x200B;

What a fucking shit storm. To start off I let my team down today by arriving late. We had to do a presentation of our project and I came late to the presentation but not the launch. I felt like an actual POS and my teacher saw it. He has a very caring personality but he can be stern like a dad (probably because he is one). he tried to cheer me up but I just couldn't respond because I just felt like a POS SOB. When he asked I was ok I said in a very low voice ""probably not"". He then whispered to my group mates that probably went along the lines of ""make sure he is ok"". If you read my last posts I hate when people point out my emotional flaws and try to help me fix it. I feel as if they see me as a crippled that can't do shit but I obviously can. I had a little bit of a break down and had really bad thoughts. One of my group members offered to talk to me but I sneaked out before he could talk to me. I went back to my dorm and locked myself in my room (I know it is the worst thing I can do but life is difficult right now). After having many bad thoughts I decided to play some TF2 to raise my mood. It helped me and I even got really happy when someone on a pub said I was a really good medic (*please do this more often us medic mains live for this*). Anyways I heard one of my friends come into the dorm (*let's call him James).* James also plays TF2 and I invited him to play with me so we played a couple of rounds and auto balance kept separating us. It was still a fun time. then I decided to go to the lounge to just chill a little and eat some dinner (ramen). Then one of the cadets from my detachment for AFROTC comes in and starts telling me how I miss class all of Friday. He realized something was wrong with me emotionally so he suggested I talk to someone in the detachment. *will I do that?* **Fuck no!** because I can't risk losing the scholarship or being sent to a hospital. Honestly at this point I don't care about my well being so I went to my room locked myself back in and thought of more bad thoughts. I plotted ways to just stop it all. Eventually I have reached here where I am in limbo. I have been up and haven't rested. I am on energy drinks because I thought I would go through with it or at the least do my homework. I am just in to much confusion lately. I lied to my parents that I passed the PT test. And lately I feel like I need an elephant tranquilizer to fall asleep quick and easily. I can't explain It but last night I had a dream of my last ex (who I broke up with on good terms). I would be running during PT and I saw her at the corner of every turn. I went out of formation and started booking it anywhere without her. but every new time I saw her she looked more demented and gory each corner. I couldn't run away. I just can't take this shit any more I want it to end. I am just so anxious that I don't want to sleep. that is pretty easy because of the weird ass meal plan system that we have here. I just get more and more concerned that people will find out the true me. A me who is weak, worthless, stupid, and emotionally empty. I have know clue what to do now. God help me. Well typing it our helped out a little bit because I was reminded of the good things today.

Gyro signing off."
"I made the decision to visit his family for a few says starting 10/10/19 and I believe tomorrow is our last full day. 
I absolutely love the area I'm visiting (I won't say the place for ID purposes) and even after a few days I think I might want to move here in the future--it really reminds me of home. 

From the first day me, my SO, and my SO's mother had arrived here his older brother has just been really...I dunno, *off* towards me. His younger brother not so much, but his older one...I dunno.

He speaks in a monotone voice with me at all times whereas he will use tone with his family. When he makes eye contact with me he looks at me in a way that makes me feel like I'm lower that him. Further more, whenever I try to make conversation with him to break the ice, or to try and get to know him better, or even just add a funny quip, it's shut down immediately. 

For example, I was just at a bonfire with the whole family and some of his neighbors and my SO has this habit of telling me tidbits of info that just aren't true. I then told him kindly to fact check before he tells me things because it makes him kinda look like an ass for ""assuming"" false info and makes me seem like an ass for believing false info (you know the phrase for 'assuming'?)
Before I even finish the word ""ass"" his older brother cuts me off and says loudly 
""Hey! Please don't call my brother an ass"". 

I get where he's coming from but the way I said it wasn't demeaning at all! I didn't even use an angry tone. What did I do wrong here?
I just shut my mouth and left the gathering. Tonight was the last straw of him just talking down to me like some dictator. 

I even brought it up with my SO and his excuse for him was that he's always like that--being monotone and 'mean' per se. I even cried the first night because of it, because I feared he just didn't like me; because I'm completely different from literally everyone else (I'm black and everyone else is Puerto Rican or White). I hate it and I hated it. 

I'm in angry tears locked up in the guest bathroom now writing this because the more I think about it, the more that it irritates me. 

I'm sorry that I dont speak Spanish and I'm sorry that I can't fucking talk to my SO without your approval. I'm also so very sorry that me trying to talk to you period is a grave sin. 

I'm gonna talk to my SO about this whenever he's done with the bonfire, because its important that he knows how I feel about this. This isn't something to be ignored. I'm not crazy for seeing these signs. I know when I'm not wanted. Truthfully, I don't know if I'll do this again if I KNOW he'll be around.

I'd talk to 'his majesty' myself, but I'm in his house. I don't want to come off any more ""disrespectful"" than I already seem like to him. 

This is so frustrating."
"I've written a thousand goodbye letters in my head. Some were brash and full of anger and some were apologetic. You didn't understand my tortured existence while I was there trying my best to explain it to you so how could you understand once I'm gone? You never understood my anxiety or how it made me feel as thought I could spontaneously combust at any moment. Youll never know how many times I ran to my room and cried so hard I was sure my head would explode. Asking God, if he was even there, why? Why am I losing so much? Why must I feel like this? Alone. Afraid. Why does everyone control me? Why can't I get out? Why doesn't anyone hear me? I tried so hard to be what you wanted me to be. Perfect, personable, smile and laugh.. But I couldn't anymore. So I decided to be me instead, but that was never good enough. I was too edgy, my smiles were forced, you could see it in my eyes.. You didn't like my gauges and piercings. You never liked anything about me.. So then slowly I drifted away from the people I once knew. I was falling into a hole but noone threw a rope. They just went on with their lives, without me. So why is this any different? At least I won't be in pain anymore. My head pounds everyday but you're is always worse. And maybe it was but I needed you. I needed someone, anyone to listen and care. Not someone who tries to top what I'm going through. My pain, both emotionally and physically, was obsolete compared to anyone elses. But they would say, you get out of everything, you don't have to do anything. NO! I COULDNT do anything.. I didn't have the mental capacity to do anything. I failed. I failed at life and love but  most of all I WAS failure. I begged God to kill me or let me die a million times.. But maybe God  would be vindictive and would give me a disease like the one who took my daddy. Then I would have more pain on top of what I already have. Then all people would do is say something about my smoking cigarettes and how I brought it on myself. Still, nothing. I don't want to blame anyone because its no one person's fault. The way I was talked to hurt the worst.. Always critical, always dogmatic. You were mean. You made me feel the worst about myself just with your tone. I was broken but you never saw me scrambling to pick up the pieces.. You were supposed to be love and yet you acted like I made you miserable.""Don't dye your hair black, it makes you look like your mother"",  I'm sorry, but she IS my mother. Even after all these years you still hold me accountable for her infedadelity. I was miserable with myself. I was always alone."
"Lately I have not been feeling very well. I blame the amount of assignments I had to do and the events that happened recently. Yet a part of me know and blame myself, for being unable to feel better, to react differently to the events that occurred. 

I’m tired all the time these days. Maybe I’m depressed? I don’t know. I come from a third world country and going to the psychiatrist is a big stigma. Moreover, I’m functioning fine and I don’t really trust psychiatrists in my country anyway, not because I think they’re under qualified, I’m more afraid of how they will see my problems in a third world country mainstream point of view. I’m afraid that my problems will be dismissed as minimal and my feelings would be insignificant to be problems. Or maybe they’ll just give me medicine to take my money lol.

Every living moment hurt. I always tell myself it’s because I’m in a bad place right now, that everything will be better. But seriously, I’m aware of the fact that there has been many diary pages of mine, writing about how life is painful over the last few years. Maybe I’m depressed. But I know for sure I’m not going to do anything about it. 

I’m a useless piece of shit. Not because I’m depressed, but because of the way I think about life, my reactions to everything that happen in general. I always tell myself things will get better once the situation change. But I still find myself looking for a better situation every time. Lots of people in my life have told me, if everything is bad about your life, maybe you’re the real problem. I believe that. Because I know that’s a fact. I know myself well.

My roommates and I had to evacuate from our apartment the other day. Because of some problems. I had a rough day, having to finish my school assignments and finding a place to stay. I could apply for a late submission permit. But I didn’t, because I didn’t want to go through the trouble of having to communicate with people. Somehow I think that people are not very tolerable of misfortune of others. They won’t believe me. I blame my high school staffs for that. Because we were treated like criminal there. The staffs at my high just assumed the worst out of their students all the time. I heard they’ve changed now, since the principle changed, but I graduated long before that.

I told my friends that. They didn’t care very much. I thought they would care more, or at least express some sort of reaction. They did actually, but then they just carried on and talk about their life again. I felt kind of empty. Maybe I was overreacting. They have their life too. I can’t remember if I have been trying to be supportive of them in the past. Maybe it’s just karma. Maybe I’m the bad friend here, I’m just too self centered to realize that.

I can’t really find new friends. I’m not good at that. I’m an introvert. Maybe it’s just an excuse that I used thousands of times whenever I think about how few friends I have. It sucks. 

I feel like I’m just a hyper for my friend, the sidekick type maybe. I remembered support them. Maybe it wasn’t enough? I was the wrong way? It’s frustrating when you can’t remember what you did wrong. 

I can’t trust people easily. I think everyone secretly hates me. I blame my mother. She once told me that when she died, I’m gonna know how important she is, because none of our relatives like me, everyone hates me. And I don’t even doubt it. Because I know it’s true. Because she told everybody how horrible a person I am. And I am horrible. A part of me told me it’s gaslighting. But what she said was partly true.

I don’t know why. But I grew up to think everyone hates me. Ever since I hit puberty. I blame my middle school classmates. They treated me like shit because I wasn’t popular or rich or good looking. But I did the same to others. So it’s just karma. This I know for sure.

The reason I’m writing this right now is literally because I feel kinda ignored today. My friends and I usually play game together every night. I haven’t played with them in a while, because of the assignments. I was going to tell them about the problem of my apartment today, because we share news of our life to each other. But I wasn’t able to finish the story. They kinda interrupted me. And one of them was sick, so they didn’t really participate in the talking. 

And we ended the game early. Because one were tired. They told me everyone was tired. And it’s kinda true. I was tired too. I was out all day. And they did sent pictures of them going out too. Maybe I’m really overreacting right now.  Pretty sure I am. 

I thought they just didn’t really appreciate me. But now come to think about it, maybe everyone was really really tired, not because they think I’m just a hyper person for them. Maybe they’ll feel better tomorrow, so I can tell the story. But there’s literally nothing else to tell really, I’ve already texted most of the thing. 

What if I just feel unappreciated in general? I can’t tell them that. It’s weird. Hey guys, I need you to pay more attention to me because I think you’re trying to ignore me and my feelings? That’s stupid. They have their own life. They’re dealing with their own problems that I don’t know about. They’re allowed to feel tired and that doesn’t mean they think lesser of me. 

But I’m still afraid. For someone with such a small self-esteem, I have such big ego lol.

Normally writing things like this will make me feel better. But I just feel worse this time. So maybe I’ll stop thinking and try to find entertainment. But lately everything sucks. I still enjoy them. I just don’t have the strength to enjoy them. 

Maybe I do really need to see a therapist. But again, I have fears about them. So much fears. I heard stories about how they’ll make me feel better. But I just assumed the worst of people at all time. 

In conclusion, I blame people for everything and it’s exhausting to be me."
"My love for you has been unrequited for more than four years now. Our story is the usual //you gave too much mixed signals// and probably I was a fool for falling for you. 

I learned today that you had been pursuing your workmate. I am not surprised, but I'm amused at how maturely I handled this...sadness. I might have loved you more than I know, for me to be content with the fact that you're on your path to your best, happiest life. Sadly, that's not the one with me in it. 😅

Thank you for all the memories we shared together: stargazing, dinners, grocery, (apparently friendly) study dates, 

all the touch, hugs, and kisses —
thank you for making me //feel// things, and I hope to bring the lessons with me from this bittersweet experience."
"In a very real sense, I wouldn’t be here today if I didn’t know this person. I met them at a very low point in my life, and we grew to be quite close quite quickly. I moved away after a while (I graduated, they were still in college), and even when I did move back that way, I maybe only saw them a handful of times, but I still hold them in my heart as an important person in my life. But that part isn’t important.

They recently announced their engagement. I don’t recall if I’ve met their partner (I might have, if briefly, ages ago), but even if I haven’t I want nothing more for my friend than for them to be happy. We had talked about their prior relationships over time and I did my best to provide support and advice, however poor it might have been. I just don’t want to see them hurt.

So now that I’m seeing their engagement announcement, while I am ultimately very happy for them and I wish them nothing but love and joy and happiness forevermore, I feel like I should be more excited about this news than I currently am. I love this person with all my heart, and I am happy that they’ve found someone to spend their life with. But I don’t feel as excited about this as I think I should. Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy, and happiness is all I’ve ever wanted for them, but I feel like there should be some “tippy-taps” or some other greater joy.

I’m sorry if this doesn’t make a lot of sense. Basically the gist is “I care about this person quite a lot. They announced their engagement. I’m happy for them but I’m not excited, and I feel like I should be, and I’m not sure what that means.”"
"What am I feeling exactly? That I have been singled out. I look desperate. It is easier for people to disregard, disrespect and ignore me. That I don't have any support whatsoever. The whole world is against me and they feel justified being mean to me. And the funny thing is no one has done anything mean to me today or in the near past. Then why this strange feeling. Why does it matter to me what other people think about me. or is it this incidence this morning that triggered this feeling. One awkward encounter with some coworkers. 

I think if I am not being respected then I am being disrespected. This feeling. It is always there and seriously aggravated when even a slight incidence leaning towards disregarding me happens. I cannot be so weak. How can I let these small things bother me. I don't give a fuck. I DON'T GIVE A FLYING FUCK. I don't care. I will do what I am supposed to do. Yeah My motherfucking stupid brain, my motherfucking insecurities and traumas, I don't care. I am breathing deep and I am mindful. Fuck off. I am as relaxed as I have ever been."
"I called my mom yesterday.  It's been a hot minute since I last called her, I was crying, and my mom encouraged me to seek help for my depression, as most recently I've been spending a lot of time sleeping.

Everyone is worried about me. I even had a friend show up at my house unexpectedly just to check up on me, and dragged me out of the house for some fresh air. 

But my thoughts keep landing on what the point of getting better is when death is inevitable. I can't escape it. 

Faith? Nah. I've found more hate and two-facedness in the churches that I once attended than I ever did anywhere else. 

But I don't know what I believe anymore. Is God real? Is he not? Is heaven and hell just a scapegoat for hoping bad people get punished and good people live forever? Why was I born in the first place? 

It's unfair. You live your life, find  friends, love, your passions, your woes... and death makes it moot.

And I'm so cynical these days too. Like even going to the doctor translates to, ""we don't really give a shit about you, personally. We just want your money."" C'mon a doctor who knows nothing about who I am as a person doesn't really give a fuck about me, it's a job.

And the doctor can't answer these questions either.

I miss being happy. But even that seems like such a farce. Why do I deserve happiness? Opening any website pours in info about how horrible everything is -- and I get it, media only reports on sad shit, gets more clicks blah blah. Happiness is like ignorance. 

And stupid ass me goes: if I sit in one room with a lamp on, and if I take a 5 min shower, and if I start buying less foods that come in plastic, and recycle (my area doesn't recycle.) I can help! I can save the earth. But all my positive changes are a drop in the bucket... even less than a drop, like a molecule. 

I just am so, so tired."
"Why is it that when I try to make a difference nothing happens? I want to help, make the world a better place and I feel I'm getting nowhere?  
I posted something on facebook, I was serious, and all I received back were jokes, till I got upset and said something. But what is it about me that people can't hear what I'm trying to get across?"
"I am so desperate that I make my mind believe in things that are not there. I feel no one can save me. I am doubtful of myself because I have never succeeded. I have not shown persistence. If I have ever had, only to see myself getting more desperate and disregarded. I cannot trust anyone anymore. It seems everyone is playing the game of power, and here I am patting myself on my back about how virtuous I am, while I am so isolated from people and the realities of life. I am sure that these are all situational conclusions. It was not long ago that I was feeling motivated. How dependent I am on other's behavior towards me ! No. I can do better than that. 

I am capable of enduring all this pain and discomfort and continue on my path of having a better life while maintaining all my virtues.  I have allowed these self-doubts to creep up by not doing what is right for me. By diverting myself from self-development. I am now sure that I will always do the right thing, so I can just focus on improving my self-worth. However hard and unfair it may seem, my only self-worth is how successful I am with things I value. I can be fooled for some time by attributes that few people around me acknowledge. But it does not mean anything if it is not aligned with my own evaluation of self-worth.

I am capable of doing the right thing under any amount of pressure. That is what I can rely on."
"Lately I have been thinking about my sexuality a lot. I think it has gotten to a point where it’s unhealthy for my mental health.

All my life I grew up thinking that I’m straight and I went through my puberty thinking about guys and all that. 

Around that time, I got really into guy on guy fictional works online. As I got obsessed with gay dudes ( like how some straight guys are into lesbian porn) I found out about bisexuality. My initial thoughts were: they’re really really cool. Back then, I didn’t know people were claiming they’re bisexual as a trend and everything, but I sort of heard about that trend. So my thoughts were: a lot of people were like me and think that bisexual people are cool.

But I was so certain a was straight back then. 
As a tomboyish girl, a lot of people thought that I was a lesbian, even my mother. Growing up, she has always told me that my sense of style look too manly and whatever, I have always dismissed them because I like what I like. But one day she found out about one of the gay fiction I was reading and the first thing she asked me was if I was a lesbian. I said no, because back then I knew for sure I was not. 

My mother has always been really protective of me and my little brother growing up. We weren’t allow to go outside or hangout with lots of people outside of school much. I’m pretty sure we were almost never allowed to. I blame my shyness and slow to adapt in new environment on that. Around middle school, I started allowed to go outside to hangout with friends. 

In middle school, I also got to go out on my own. That’s when I got really close with my best friend at the time. We spent the while summer hanging around. Which sounds like a lot, but really only once every few weeks or so. Yet it was still too many times, compared to the zero time in the past, so she asked if we were dating. To that I answered no. Now I know that the reason she were asking that was because she thought friends didn’t need to hangout that much. I resent and pity her at the same time. But that’s not important, the point is, I was really uncomfortable about that, because I thought I was 100% straight. 

At the end of middle school, when our class was hanging out with our home room teacher and she was guessing who our crushes during middle school was, when it my turn, she said a girl name. I was kind of offended because I was sort of one of her favorite student too. New friends have always thought I was gay as their first impression of me.

And I thought I was straight at this time, I was so sure I was straight. I was pissed, because I lived in a world where people judge who you are, for your appearance. 

I literally spent my whole childhood and teenager years thinking people didn’t think I’m straight because I had short hair and fat. I wouldn’t say my behavior were so vulgar and dude-ish, because most girls in my class were acting similarly, it just that my look made the behavior more “ not fit in society norm about gender roles”. 

I went through my teenage years thinking I acted strange, and I was so proud not to fit in the “normal gender roles”. Now, looking back, my behaviors were not that bizarre, my look just made them so. 

The irony is that now that I’m in doubt about my sexuality, I’m more scared to look and be seen as “not straight” and “not normal”. I had been grow my hair long and cutting it super short from time to time because I loved how different the hairstyles look. I’m now currently having long hair, and I still want to cut it short again, but I’m so afraid now. I care more about how I dress now, how looking more feminine with be less bothersome.

And as a girl who liked reading gay fiction, an issue in the community at the time was that, as gay fiction gained popularity, many people read it for the trend and have no actual respect or consideration for people in the LGBTQ+ community, e.g. liking gay men but still discriminate against gay women. 

As a teen, being cool seemed like everything, so to I claimed to cared about gay women, as in, saying stuffs like, “I don’t dislike them, I just don’t understand how they fall in love”. And I really didn’t understand, the sparks between 2 girls and everything in between. Yet I still wished, yes, wished I were bisexual, because I still thought bisexual people are cool. So I claimed stuffs like how unrealistic girl boobs in hentai are and how I preferred girls with a wide hip rather than enormous tits whenever some guy friends bring up those topics.

Even now, I still think that I got so obsessed over how cool and awesome bisexual people are, I somehow bent my sexuality. Because there were gay girls in my class, they were pretty open, yet aí still didn’t care about that “whole other world” that much. And now, suddenly I do? Seems wrong haha.

Also, like many teenage girls, I have imagine boyfriends, I still do actually, because I actually don’t have lots of luck in the dating department, mostly because I was fat, had no self-esteem and lived in a country where my size means I’m probably gonna die at 30 (yes, I’m Asian).  But to be honest, it mostly just because that was what people told me my whole life. So I had imagine boyfriends. 

As I about to graduate high school, I had a new one, I created a new world, and in this world, I was bold. I was so bold when I created this world that I decided, I’m bisexual in this world. Because I still think bisexual people are cool. 

This is actually where the story really begins. As time passes, I started to actually believe I’m bisexual, even though I was pretty sure I never had a crush on any girls ( maybe not true). I started to notice pretty girls around me more, and it was easy because there were pretty girls everywhere. But I was pretty sure I was straight. I told myself so many times that I’m straight, the imaginary me in the alternative world was the queer one. I was so sure. 

Then I just got less sure, because telling myself I’m bisexual just feels good, as if I’m a kid that got a toy from the store that I really want. 

I was really happy when I found out a definition of bisexual means that bring bisexual does not necessarily means that I only like boys and girls. Because around this time, I found out I actually really into trans girls porns. Yes, I’m disgusting. But I told myself I’m straight, because I’m only interested in their dick, not their boobs, and that if they get fucked, it still considered gay porn. So I’m still straight. The definition just made me happy, because I still want to be cool, still want to be bisexual, but the definition of bisexual just wouldn’t fit me, because I read it somewhere, that bisexual and pansexual are different, because bisexuality does not include transgender people. And I don’t know, being pansexual, just doesn’t sound as cool. Which is also very important, because it was also the reason I’m so sure I’m straight, because I just think of being bisexual as being cool.

I find myself questioning, but every time it ended up with me reassuring myself I’m straight, and that I was just wanting to be cool.

A few days ago, I talked to my best friend in middle school (we still hangout actually, just extremely less than we used to). And I remembered all the time that she changed clothes in front of me and all the time I had thoughts of what’s it would feel like touching her inappropriately. I also remembered telling myself those thoughts are just me wanting to be bisexual and thinking then created them all in my head. That I’m not actually interested in any of the “hot scenes” in my head, I just wanted to be cool, for myself, so I created a a fantasy where I was bisexual. My sick mind is sick.

We talked about stranger things. During high school, she got really into politics. And during university, she started watching some right wing people talking about social issues on YouTube. And she would told me about that, because I sort of run out of things to talk about, so little common interest. At first, some of the politics views made sense, some just sounds wrong, but I didn’t care much about politics to know and to talk or debunk the logics. But obviously, I didn’t like it, because right wing (still don’t know enough to talk about politics, just don’t support extremists). 

The conversation about stranger things was awkward, mostly because of me. I talked about Robin being gay, and then I made a cringe joke that I stole from Tumblr, she obviously had an opinion but didn’t say anything, because she knew I wouldn’t like that. I knew that silence. Because that’s how I treat people whose mind I know wouldn’t change even if I talked about the issue that their way of thinking have. So I knew we disagreed. The conversation ended, awkwardly.

Then, I remembered all the time when she talked about subjects that I knew nothing about, so I was kind of bored, and we ended up talking about they things we talked about hundreds times ago, because we had so little in common as we grow up, so we got more bored.

It made me sad. I just realized that while I was busy hiding from the real world, my friend actually care about these issues and did her search of information on them and I didn’t have enough knowledge to discuss them with her. I couldn’t keep up. So we grew apart. 

And I was sad, so sad, I don’t know. Felt like I wanted to be close to her. Discuss this things she was interested about, without her being frustrated that I didn’t know anything. But like, not as a friend, which sounds so stupid now that I said it out loud.

But for the first time in my life, I seriously considered the probability of me being queer. At first it felt good, I’m queer, yay, I’m one of the cool people now.

Then I remembered friends that I have seen their naked body, I got really. What if I told them, and they think back at those time, I jokingly touched their  body ( not sexually), but still, they weren’t very happy with those jokes back then, imagine now that they might think I had other intentions. I got scared, back then when I did them as jokes, it wasn’t as serious, sexual harassment are so much more lightly taken when you’re not sexually attracted to people’s gender I guess. So I’m scared to tell some of my friends.

Other friends, some I’m less scared to tell than others, yet one that I’m really close with right now. Once said that she didn’t like lesbians that much. Which was not an okay thing to say, but consider how a lot of people in my country is like that, I didn’t say anything, and she was actually really nice, so she was a friend I didn’t want to lose. 

I’m still in doubt. I still think I just somehow hypnotized myself into thinking I’m queer. Because I was so sure I was straight, even with all those cultural exposure and even with how much I wanted to be bisexual, I was was still so sure I was straight. So the fact that I somehow suddenly think I’m bisexual now, seems like I just slowly convinced myself to be bisexual overtime. 

I’m in questioning, yet I’m so afraid to talk to any of my friends about it, even though I really want to. Because I was so certain I was straight, I told them that, and I’m so afraid that they’ll think I lied to them now, or worse, they could think I’m doing it for attention. And other reasons that I stated above. 

I have been acting sort of gayer, a little bit, dropping a little hints here and there, the reactions were pretty weird. Still it kind of heartbreaking, probably because of my interpretation on the reactions, I will only know for sure when I told them I guess, but I’m now ready now. It’s so stupid, because I remembered when I watched Shane Dawnson coming out video, my reaction was so ignorant, I just didn’t understand why he cried when being bisexual was literally the coolest thing. Yes, I’m one of those people who will only sympathize with people once I go through the same thing. I don’t know where all my sympathy went growing up haha. 

And I was actually feeling so good the past couple of days before all the questioning too. It’s like the cycle repeated itself again. So many issues with myself and I always ended up wishing I could postpone tomorrow a little longer."
"Well I got no one I can tell this to so I guess I'll share this here with whoever reads these things.  So..one life of mines I'm a father of 3 and widower(she pasted away in 2017). I do lots of activities with the kids and I been told on numerous occasions by them they are pleased with my parenting.  Currently unemployed but got decent saving and money to pay for stuff, still looking for work.  Lots of free time and the kids are out of school so we do a ton of swimming and outdoor stuffs.  And there's the other life.  

I always been bi but never got into the whole going with guys thing til recently.  On top of that I crossdress.  Well I put up my profile on a couple dating apps and omg my phone buzzed with so so many replies.  It's weird cuz I look incredibly young for being in my late 30s.  Easily can pass as a teen/early 20s.  So anyways, I been incredibly impulsive of late due to all the attention.  I slept with 3 guys in 5 nights with my sister having the kids over night.  

My son (11) doesn't know but my daughter(8)stumbled across my crossdressing pics .  She seemed okay with it tho she stated she wasn't a big fan of the wig.  I haven't told my son yet.  If I had to think his reply would be probably jokes.  He is very sarcastic.  I could imagine him saying like ""does this mean I'm the man of the house now""

Going back to the sleeping around thing.  It's weird cuz I'm not even huge in the sexual component, it has its moments but I do really like the attention.  And even I think I'm backing off the sleeping around thing I have found a couple guys I really kinda like who they are.  Tho my profile isn't really set up describing the fact that I got kids.  And at some point I feel like someone is gonna be let down.  And like idk I feel like it'd be a huge change for the kids too.  I thought of transitioning too but it's $$$. And ofc what then the kids call me mom?!  

I feel like damned if I do damned if I don't.  I thought well maybe I date women but I'm pretty invisible when I put my profile for girls.  And I do say I do have a preference for being pursued than pursuing.  

In the mix of all this just trying to stick with this diet.  Down 25pounds, intermittent fasting works but just so much restraint I have to have.  So used chowing down snacks now instead of enjoying food I use it to stop feeling hungry.  I do miss chocolate alot.  Still far from my target weight which is 40 more pounds and would firmly place me in the skinny category.  Gotta stay strong... Keep being told I look great already but I was once was nice and small and I looked so much better than now.  They don't see the fatness but I do."
"I don't expect this to make any sense to anyone but me. These are nothing but wandering thoughts I need to revisit. I see this subreddit as the only place where I can write this, come back and read it, without anyone knowing of it.

I'll write this in English because, for some reason, I'm not able to describe what I'm thinking in Spanish without feeling some kind of embarrassment. 

look at this like some kind of auto therapy

never told anyone how I really feel, and even the simple thought of writing about this feels uncomfortable, that's why I'll write it in English; if someone I know ever reads this at least there's a chance for them not to understand it. 

thinking about it, there's no point on writing something that no one's ever gonna read, but I feel like if I write this I'll be able to clear my mind, and who knows, maybe even share this at some point.

I wanna start saying that I'm feeling good, I know I am, I love my family, my house, my friends, my hobbies, there's nothing I would like to change, at least by now. 

there's something, though, that bothers me a little when I think about it.

what if she just leaves, how much would that affect me? It's not been that long since we formally met each other, and that's why it bothers me so much knowing how bad I'll end if she leaves. It's happened before, it didn't feel good, and if it happens again I can't tell if it's only going to feel worse. 

I've lost interest in pretty much everything but her, and I had promised myself that I wouldn't spend this winter break like this, wasting my time. But I don't feel like I'm wasting it.

maybe it was a mistake saying what I said tonight, maybe I was too impatient. The uncertainty of what's going to happen is one of the worst feelings I've ever had. Maybe I'm exaggerating.

am I going too fast? I didn't think so then, in fact, I'd swear that I'm the one that was slowing things down.

I don't know how to tell her, but I want her to forget him, not for my own benefit but for hers. As I said it's not been too long, but I can already tell her suffering is senseless. I feel like she's locked, and she's the one who threw the key away.

I really wanna tidy up my mind right now, but this seems like something that I won't accomplish in one night. I hope tomorrow I find myself more motivated that I am now. I don't know if I like or I hate to admit that I'd rather spend the day talking to her like I have been doing for the last days.

I don't want to feel like I'm wasting my time, but no matter what I do there's always this one question in my mind: Was this worth it?

I know I won't ask me that question after writing this, there's no one I could ever tell this, this is something I had to chat with myself."
"I am in a state that I am completely dependent on a third party, who I am convinced, holds personal grudge against me. They are using their power to derail my life at this moment. They want me to react and sabotage my development. I cannot let them win. Yes, they have power over my current situation, but I have complete control over my reaction and response.

&#x200B;

I have always tried to be true to myself and expressed what I have felt was right. I was always fighting for truth in my head, but we all know how personal biases affect our thought process. So, it is only logical that I forsake this belief that I should always speak out what is true. I should conform to societal norms while at the same time be true to myself. How can I do that. By reacting carefully. If you don't have anything good to say, and if people have not asked about honest opinions, don't your true feelings, or if possible do not express anything. Even if they ask for it, be very careful. People might say they are ready for the truth, but if the truth hurts, they will attach you with that pain. You don't want any of that. What you should do instead, is focus on your job. You give power to other people as soon as you start focusing on them. Because you lose touch with yourself when you focus on others.

&#x200B;

I cannot give power to every single person I interact with. I have always felt this pressure that it is somehow my responsibility to make other person happy. Don't do that. If you are sure of your actions, don't worry about other peoples reaction. But take it as an input for modifying your social behavior. Only, if it differs greatly from your model of the society. But otherwise, do not care at all. Be sure of your own behavior and that is enough and that is the best you can do."
"Hard to believe it is the last day in June. The year has gone by so swiftly, 6 more months to 2020. 

I'm in a much better place emotionally now than I was in the beginning of the year and I think a lot of that has to do with journaling, which for me, is working now. I'm actually on my third journal, well starting tomorrow, and there is a half-finished one, half-finished because it was lost and reappeared mysteriously on the back of the couch. I love our wormhole, makes the house weird.

Working hard on my afghan, it is sort of a free form one. I wish I could afford to buy twenty skeins of yarn and do a regular afghan, but this one will have to be a few rows of this color, switch out, new color, switch out, so I can just buy a few skeins when I have the money. Hoping I can find a skein to match the one I already used to start as I kind of want to end on the same note. If not, well I will just have what I have. I'll add an edging in some greyish color to go with the theme to wrap it all up in any case.

Kind of looking forward to beginning a new journal in July as the old one is done today. I have this idea about making a journal of envelopes, each smaller envelope is a day, and has some formatted stuff, things I write about each day, on the cover, and inside notes, pictures etc. Then bundle the whole month into one larger envelope, so it is like gifts. I need to work on that image to see what I can do."
"Damn, it has been a while. forgive me father for I have sinned. lol jk. I feel good. my body feels good. little minor aches and pains as I get older and my body does not recover like it used to from all the physical activities I do, but I feel good overall. mentally and physically. I have abstained from Marijuana for at least a month. The last time I actually remember smoking was a couple days after 4/20. I can't pinpoint the date exactly but I know it has been more than a month. I have been experimenting with mushrooms close to once a week this month but i have had such a good time with them that I think if i can keep it to a once in a while occasion they will be very beneficial for me. I have had some amazing experiences on them and feel less controlled by my vices and more in touch with the people around me and nature. I feel more connected in a way. Life as a whole is going very smoothly right now and I am enjoying the ride like I haven't for several years. I feel lucky and have so much gratitude for the feeling of love and wholeness that eluded me for so long. I used to feel trapped by anxiety and fear. Those feelings have immensely subsided. and life as a whole feels amazing. I keep coming back to how lucky I feel to wake in the morning and take a deep breath. Boss just got back. Hope everyone has a beautiful weekend. One Love."
"Dear A,

We have only known each other a few months and I am afraid to tell you I love you.

Before you, I thought that love was something that would take time- a lot of time- to develop. I assumed you couldn't possibly know if you truly loved someone until a year or years had passed. If I was looking at this relationship from the outside, I would have scoffed and rolled my eyes and said ""Its only a passing phase, it won't last"". I would never have believed that anyone could make me feel sexy and happy in my own body with or without makeup, dressed up or down. That with you, for the first time in my entire life, I feel as if the things I think and say are interesting, witty, and important to someone.

I've been too scared to tell you how scary it is to love and be loved in return.

I'm afraid to say ""love"" because love, for me, conjures memories of all the selfish people in my life who have used the word 'love' as a way of claiming possession over me, as a way to manipulate me, and as a way to hurt me. It's not like that. I don't love you in the way that addicts love cocaine. I hope that you don't feel that my love for you is a burden or that it comes with a price. 

I love you you the way  I love the sound of a piano, or the feel of a cool breeze on a warm day, i love you the way I love watching the tide come in at the beach. I love you the way I love laughing until I cry. I love you the way I love ice cream.

No matter what happens in the future, even if we don't work out- nothing will change just how grateful I am for the way I feel when I'm with you. You have irrevocably changed the way I feel about myself, the way I feel about men, and the way I feel about love."
"My oldest brother was just killed by a hit and run driver.  His death hit the family hard, but I was especially worried about my mother and her overwhelming grief.  During this time, my younger brother asked me to store his firearm in my house because our brother's funeral was in Mexico.  I have to admit that for a brief second, I thought of using the firearm for my own suicide.  The thought lingered in my mind for a very brief moment, and it was immediately followed by the thought of my grieving mother.  I wondered how I could be so selfish and make her suffer even more. Then and there, I decided suicide was not something I could ever entertain."
"Grandma fell down in her bedroom the other night. My family and I had to take her to the hospital. Waiting in the ER is like standing in purgatory. It's just such a miserable place, which I guess shouldn't have to be said. After all, the morgue is just one floor down. Yeesh, too morbid. Anyway, grannie's fine, nothing broken, no fractures. She's lucky, though. She apparently fell on the side of her bed and managed to break her fall. Had she fallen on a harder surface such as the floor or the table in her room, I'd hate to imagine. Thank God that's over.

Then my brother gets sick again. Yes, again. A cold is going around their campus, and being in a dorm with a bunch of other dudes is a perfect breeding ground for disease to spread. He said he really didn't feel good, so I picked him up and brought him over to my place. He's asleep and I can only hope he gets better. I'm not really doing too hot myself. I'm starting to get depressed at this job hunting business. I made some contacts with people, but most of them either keep ghosting me or give me a half-assed response. Ugh, my head hurts. I think I'm the one who's getting sick.

I hate this job. I hate the environment and I'm starting to hate the people. If I have to hear ""Happy Monday!"" or ""Hey, four more days until Friday!"" one more time, I'm going to have an aneurysm. And driving while some impatient prick rides me from behind closely and lays on the horn is always a great time to be had. You see what's happening to me? This dark, biting sarcasm is not something I want. Now my sister is sick with some kind of staph infection, but the antibiotics are making her better...I hope.

I need to keep it together. If not for myself, then for my family."
"Dear Diary

Another humdrum day.  It's cold and dreary outside, just like my mood.  

A boring day.  Which is not necessarily bad.  I've had exciting days, and truth be told I'll take a boring one any day over an exciting one.  

it was good though.  Got some thinking caught up on.  Downside is I ate too many Reese's pieces.  Blech.  

Some days I feel like I'm on the edge of figuring it all out.  That it just takes that one more moment of looking at things the right way and everything will fall into place.  But like that dream I had of walking the dog last night (seriously!  Who dreams of walking a dog?  WTF subconscious?) it flitters away like so many random numbers, here for a second then gone away forever.

"I hope I titled this properly this time lol. Well this is my second ever post on reddit, could be the first one if my other one really did get deleted. Oopsies. 

Maybe I should actually explain why I’m starting to write here? Well mainly it’s so I don’t try and contact my ex again. Whatever I want to say to him I can write on here.

The story of it let’s see.. We met on Valentine’s Day two years ago, we sat next to each other on a 14 hour flight. I was coming home from a holiday and he was on his way to do exchange. We kept in contact after the flight, started messaging each other every day, a couple of days after the flight. He did exchange in a different state, so for Easter he flew down to spend it with me and my family. We were instantly comfortable with each other and became intimate. 

We talked, FaceTimed, and messaged each other all the time, every day until we could see each other again. I flew to visit him whilst he had a short break. By the end of my time with him, I realised I had fallen for him, we had become very close. As he knew he had to go home soon, he hesitated with us being offical. I told him he had to make up his mind whether he wanted to try a long distance relationship, or just be friends. He had fallen in love with me too, we made it offical and started doing long distance.

Long distance was surprisingly easy. We organised and planned when we could FaceTime and stuck with it. We made time for each other and our feelings continued to grow. 

After 5 long months, I had finished up uni for the year and could finally visit him. I flew over to him, met his family, and stayed with them. Things were going well. We returned to his uni accomodation and I met his friends. 

Within the first two weeks of meeting, he had done something less than desirable. We were not going out at that stage and had just met. I discovered this whilst I was visiting him. What he did was not what I had a problem with. I had a problem with him lying about it for a year. This thing affected my health, and he had put me at risk. He constantly denied to me that what I suspected was true. 

I packed my suitcase, hid in the basement, cried, and rang my mum to get me on the next flight home. Eventually he found me and I told him I knew he had lied to me. There wasn’t a lot of yelling, just crying. He pulled out a diary of his and told me to read it. 

The diary started a day before he went on exchange, a day before he met me. I read about the day he met me. He had written the nicest things about me, the nicest I’d ever heard. He wrote about a stunning girl who he had met on the plane, a girl that he thought was out of his league, a girl he instantly connected with. The thing that stuck out to me was that he had written that I was everything he wanted in a life long partner. It ended with don’t let that girl go, find her and marry her. This was the day we had first met, a year ago at the time. 

I knew at that point that he was the one. I had always hoped he was. I rang my mum, had her pause the flight plans and said there might be still some hope. There was. I went to bed, we lay opposite each other in silence. I slowly crept closer to him and hugged him. We talked everything out and he said he meant everything in that diary. Despite the tears and pain, we were intimate again. We were back together and I had fallen in love with him all over again. 

Although this is not the end of our story, it’s been long enough. I’ll finish the rest tomorrow, I should sleep. That’s as brief as I could get it and it’s still ridiculously long. I’ve skipped all the wonderful memories and moments, I’ll fill them in after the story is finished. 

See ya reddit xxx

This Diary is Not About a Girl

So I guess I'm starting a diary. It's something I've thought about on and off for a while but I don't get motivated to do much of anything so I'm not surprised it took a big emotional spike to get started. I also won't be surprised if I quit a few days in, it just seems like the kind of thing that would be done just as well in your head, but whatever. I need some catharsis right now and the thinking has just been turning into overthinking too quickly, so here we are.

I'm writing about this girl I had a crush on from high school. I'll just call her B. She was by far my most serious crush, and at this rate, might be forever. I did everything that you would tell a high school guy to do at that point, but really fucking awkwardly. I asked her out over text even though the whole school knew she wasn't about to start dating any time soon. I tried to play it like I wasn't asking her out but I was asking to go to a museum with her on Valentine's day. How much more obvious could I be? And then when she said she wasn't looking to date anyone atm I said it didn't have to be a date, I'd be fine being friends. And the saddest part is I meant it, more than anything else I'd ever told her. I felt so alone at that school and she was the closest thing I had to an equal/rival. I don't believe in that ""friend zone"" shit anyway, and if she said yes at that point, I think we could have been good friends even to this day. But that wasn't fair, to her or to me, since its pretty hard to be ""just friends"" with the creepy guy who's being too pushy to begin with and it gave me a clever but unhealthy defense mechanism which let me say to myself ""shes just a bitch for not being friends with the new kid"" as if that makes sense anyway. Anyway, she rejected me awkwardly which was fine all things considered, even though I couldn't let it go for a while, and we pretended it never happened.

I tried forgetting her and did a damned good job of it too. I only thought about her when something reminded me of her, usually another girl and the thought of where I tend to go wrong on a larger scale. Perfectly innocent stuff, honestly. I even told myself that because she handled the situation so bad I shouldn't want her, even if she changed her mind. I told myself I'd reject her if she contacted me again. What a fucking lie that was... Why does it have to be so hard to just face your fucking emotions?

 I can't even remember the last time I thought about her until yesterday, but then we matched on fucking tinder (I'll probably write about how much I hate tinder eventually). On the morning of new years day I was swiping and I came across her profile, took in a few little things (like how she is still at brown, how she looks somehow younger/more vibrant than I remember, how fucking basic her profile was (just a standard ""the office"" quote like every other girl on tinder)), and then I swiped expecting to never see her again. Instant match. What a fucking endorphin rush right there: the only girl I really crushed on for more than like a month, who then rejected me which was tantalizing since we had about 2 months left in school together in half the same classes, swiped right on me almost 3 years later. I really couldn't believe it. I still can't believe it. I thought of something neutral to say. ""happy new year"" + ""how have you been?"" and figured I'd just wait and see what happens. But, see, that's the fucking problem. Nothing happened. Not yet anyway, but come on its an app on your phone how hard is it to respond within a day if you have something to say.

So now I'm here waiting. I keep thinking if there's something I can do, but a double text is so fucking desperate and anything else is hilariously stalker-ish. I tried taking my mind off all this but I just cant. Games, movies, work, anything. I got my grades back this morning and they were perfect, which was great news and I was super happy, but only for like 5 minutes before I went back to B's profile, flicking through the same 4 photos. Waiting for her to break the silence. For a second I even considered sending her a screenshot of my grades hoping to impress her, just in case she didn't already know how vain/narcissistic/desperate I am.

I thought it might be a fake profile for a second. All the information is right afaik but its not like its even that much. I literally told you all of it already, and the pictures could be from insta or something. She's definitely hot enough to be worth faking. Then again, this is about the kind of profile I'd expect her to make, and don't bots want to message back asap if they're gonna scam someone? So who knows. Or she might be screwing with me, but that doesn't strike me as her kind of game. Or a million other things. Can you tell I've been thinking about these possibilities a while?

In all honesty, here's what most likely happened: she swiped on me like a week or 2 ago and hasn't opened tinder since (or she has and already met someone and deleted it or something, but whatever) and she'll just reply when she feels like opening the stupid app. It's also very possible she has tinder notifications off so that might take a while. Especially since yesterday was a holiday and she's probably spending time with family.

That is both the best and worst possibility since it gives me a real chance with her, but at the same time I'm just so fucking scared. I keep thinking ""how am I gonna fuck it up this time?"" (fuck I feel like I have ptsd from this shit. I don't say that lightly either, I was legitimately symptomatic of ptsd for a bit after I asked her out) or even ""how is she gonna fuck this up?"" Like maybe what if she hasn't changed? I don't mean that in a bad way, btw; if I met that same girl from high school right now and she liked me I'd be ecstatic, but wouldn't it be weird if she just hasn't grown for the past 3 years? If she hasn't developed herself as a person? I know I have, and not just a little bit. That's one of the things I'm leaning on most btw, the fact that maybe my growth as a person could impress her, but what if she hasn't grown? What should I do? Would it be too egotistical of me to tell her she disappointed me in that? Or would it be more mean not to? And if she has changed, what if I don't like what she's become? What if she's one of those uber-socialist-sjw-types? That could easily happen at college, especially a place like brown. I think that's actually the saddest outcome, but then at least I wouldn't have to feel bad.

But on the flip side of all of this, my optimistic side is just hyper-romanticizing the whole situation. That's a bad habit of mine (and most people, I think). I tend to meet a crush and then plan our first day together, and then our week, and soon enough our lives. It gets out of hand pretty fast and I end up attached to the idea of what we could be way more than I probably should be. That's really what makes me so anxious about all this. If she were just some random hot, smart girl who I didn't end up with, that would be fine, but its almost like I have this artificial emotional attachment to her and how fun it seems like it would be if I got to be with her. At the same time, I feel like stuff like that is still really important. If I didn't have that level of motivation, I'd probably end up a 40-year-old virgin because the reality of dating is that its just not worth it. Not if you're being pragmatic about it. You have to be willing to have some fun, to take some risks, to get attached to some optimistic ideal in the hopes that you will be able to realize it eventually. That's risky for 2 reasons: she might not be willing to do it with you and you 2 might not be able to do it together even if you were both sincerely trying your hardest. But it seems more tragic not to try at all, so if it takes some nonsensical pre-relationship emotional attachment, then so be it.

I have a migraine. For the first time in a while, actually. So I think this is where I'll stop. Hope you liked the novella.

Yours, Alex

I'm not sure how healthy this is, its only been like an hour, but I'm craving a round 2 so here it goes. Lets try a bit of a love-poem-stream-of-consciousness mix this time, since I think I wrote enough self-diagnostic pseudo-psychology for today.

I keep taking out my phone to open tinder. I'm not checking for a reply, I'll get a pinged when that happens and I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. I just look at her profile, however bare it is; swipe through her pics; wonder what she's doing... There's this one picture of B that I can't get my mind off of. I'm pretty sure it's a beach picture with a friend, but it's heavily cropped so you only see her face and she's smiling wider than I've ever seen her smile before. I thought that's what I liked about it at first but that can't be everything. She just looks so god damned pretty in that picture, its crazy. Not that she isn't good looking normally, she's beautiful all the time, but this picture is something else, man. I also noticed I've never seen her without makeup until I saw that pic, and after seeing it, I don't know why she ever wears any. I didn't even know she had freckles, and they're the most adorable little freckles. Again, makeup isn't making her ugly, she probably honestly looks about as attractive with it as without, but ""about as attractive"" means something completely different when you're not wearing makeup. You get so many extra points for just being attractive if you can. She could just wake up and go do her day and people would just have to stand by and be like ""damn..."" But there's one more important thing here: I can't make out her pupils in that pic. That might not sound like much, but pupil dilation is just about the strongest factor in whether people see others as happy or not, more than smiling sometimes. It's also extremely reliable at telling if they actually are happy. Look it up, its cool. That definitely adds a layer of mystery to the pic, like she's looking at me, almost looking into me, and she seems happy from a pragmatic perspective, but it's impossible to tell. If that's not some beautiful symbolism for my shitty situation then idk what is. The eye contact is definitely another thing. I remember Jordan Peterson talking about how important that is in things like magazines which need to catch your eye. On men's magazines about half the covers are gadgets and toys and things and the other half are pretty women looking into the camera. On women's magazines it's always a pretty woman. There's something so obviously captivating about that, probably since it shows intent and the fact that a pretty woman, someone of inherent worth, is intending anything with you and smiling is a score no matter who you are. It actually has the same effect on the brain as cocaine (to a much smaller degree, of course... for most people). That's what she should have as her first pic instead of the one where shes wrapped in so many coats she looks like a marshmallow. Peterson's lectures helped a lot in interpreting my feelings for B, and others. But I said no self talk now. This time we're focused on B.

I remember there was a kid at school I heard on the bus comparing B to other girls. I just laughed, as if it was even a competition. There was like one other girl in the whole building who even sort of stood up to her, and that's a big sort of. I swear I almost slapped the kid. I should have, even if it was just since he was being disrespectful to women in general.

Fuck it. It's me time again.

Writing about this is actually helping me parse out some of these ideas. I can't tell if it helps with the feelings yet, but we'll see. I keep coming back to the same thought: ""I want her to want me."" That feels like such a weird thing to type. Maybe since its so taboo to say something like that today, but its true. And I don't see why that has to be a bad thing. I really do think I'd be good for her, and she'd be good for me too. If I'm wrong, then fuck it, I'll eat my words but if I'm right then why shouldn't I want her to want me? If it really would be good for both of us isn't that kind of just the same as wishing us both well? I think that's why it's taboo. People don't like thinking of men as anything but power hungry greedy pervy little fucks, and they're not willing to think that maybe a man could actually be good for a woman. Well that's bullshit. I know I'd be good for her. I'd be good for just about anyone, honestly, but not all of them would be good for me. That's why this is really so important to me, I think she's one of the few that might actually be good for me too. I've had girls try to date me that had less personality than a piece of stale wonder bread. It seemed like they thought they were gracing me with their feminine presence and that's all they thought they had to give. I have a right to aim higher than that. So yes, I want her to want me. I want her to want me as bad as I want her. That's definitely another reason I like that picture so much. It leaves the door open for that, but it doesn't confirm it.

I’m going to eat dinner now.

So I’m here again. I don’t know if anything has ever tied me up like this before. I just can’t... Stop... Thinking about her. And I haven’t even seen her, or talked with her, or anything. Even if I do get rejected again, I want to have at least 5 minutes of a real, solid conversation with her beforehand. I need to humanize her to settle myself, otherwise I’ll just keep worshiping via self-torture. I just need to meet her, really meet her as a person. Then I’ll be able to let go if she makes me. At the same time, I should have made it pretty clear by now that I think if we get to that point, it won’t stop there. I truly am optimistic about that. I know I am enough for her, and so much more, and if I know her at all, I think she’ll really impress me. 

It just struck me that I haven’t actually gone back and read through our text logs from back then. Brb. 

Okay, that wasn’t nearly as awkward as I remember. At least not from my end. It was awkward, don’t get me wrong (especially if the timestamps are right and I actually texted at fucking 5am, but I can’t imagine I did that it doesn’t sound like me at all), but it really didn’t have to be if she just gave like an ounce of courtesy. I tried calling before I texted. It’s a bit old fashioned but honestly fuck how millennials do it anyway. Text is so bland. I’d rather talk, and hear, than type and read. Especially for any real conversation. I was calling from an out of state number, but something tells me she wouldn’t have picked up anyway. Everything about that interaction just screamed “don’t talk to me.” I remember thinking “this is going bad” after the second 1 word response, but I figured there’s not much difference between bad and worse in this game so I went for it. She didn’t even respond after I said I wanted to “get to know her as a friend more than anything else.” I can’t imagine if I were actually a sensitive person, if I actually needed a friend instead of just craved one, what I would have felt like after being so bluntly blown off. That is the kind of stuff that made me worried if she was really the kind of person I would like. I knew she had every right to react like that but it was just so… cut off… It’s the kind of stuff that makes me worry if she’s changed for the worse, rather than the better. 

None of that was fair of me. That last paragraph was pretty shitty to even write. I had to write it, but still. She’s a pretty decent person, I could sense that whenever she was in the room. Just for some reason any time she had to interact with me she got spooked. That’s fine, it really is, but it just adds to the confusion of this whole fucking situation. Why would she swipe on me in the first place if I’m so creepy to her?

Wait fuck what if her friends were controlling her tinder for a night and they swiped and then when we matched she was like “I know that creep fuck no.” Fuck. I never considered she might have friends. Fuck I’m an idiot. We have a new most likely scenario. It’s called “Fucked: The Story of How Alex is Fucked” and it’s gonna be the end of me. I’m seriously breaking down right now. 

I’m investing too damn much into this whole situation. The only reason I got worked up over it in the first place was because the swipe had to mean something. But maybe it didn’t. Maybe it just didn’t and I practically fell in love with a girl I never even fucking knew over a shitty fucking app. This shit’s a fucking black mirror episode I swear to fucking god. Just kill me now. I need the Eternal Sunshine treatment right about now. Just let me forget about all this shit and then remember it again when I need to if she ever decides to fucking respond. Lazy bitch. How dare she make me feel things. Especially without even talking to me. Who does she think she is? I need a therapist. And a girlfriend. Will accept package deal. "
"The year 2018 went by in a blur. It all went by in a blink of an eye. While reminiscing about the past year on new year's eve, I felt grateful just be among family on that day.

We eat, we laughed, and played games as we waited for the clock to strike 12. For the most of the time there, I'm ashamed to say, I spent the evening stuffing my face and watching videos on my phone. I was there among my family, at my aunt's house, and I interacted with them as well. I didn't however participate on any of there games.

The games, well more like activities, ranged from singing and dancing to playing ""La Loteria"". (Loteria is Spanish for bingo, bit instead of using numbers, we use pictures of mexican culture in the boxes that we fill. Search ""loteria cards"" in google to get the full picture of what I'm talking about)

I would have played lotteria if they weren't playing with actual money. I don't like to bet, seems like a waste if you lose and this game is more luck than anything, something that comes scarcely for me. No matter, I still had fun that day.

After 12, we packed up and went home. It was a good day to remember.

(I hope you guys had a blast like I did. Happy new year!)"
"And they don’t stop coming. Sigh. 

I’m crying. This early in the morning. I wonder when K will be happy? When I hate him so much that I can’t look at him? So twisted. 

I keep throwing up today.  It’s getting worse everyday. It’s a bit hard suffering alone.  I wonder if I’m making a mistake Friday??and I’ll be alone. Again.  

Guess I’ll get my new phone sometime this week. I hate paying for technology. I’m watching the good doctor. Why didn’t anyone tell me about this sooner!?  I don’t have much to say today. I’m sad. Fat. Hungry. And alone. Lol. FML!

Today is my sister's 13th birthday. Sadly, I cannot be there because I am poor as all hell, and no one can come get me. I had hoped to be in a better situation by the time her birthday rolled around, but here I am.

"I remember when I met you, almost two years ago. I remember how I felt when I first saw you. I knew there was something about you that was extremely attractive, in multiple ways. We've gotten to know each other a little bit, and I've only grown to long for you more than the day I first met you. 

I'm scared that even after this, it won't end the way that I want it to. And that scares the living shit out of me. I'm not looking for anything crazy. Just for you to fill this monster of a void that lives inside of me."
"Why are we still alive?  With our lack of self preservation, affinity for violence, and constant suicidal thoughts it's astounding that we have survived for this long.  So many close calls; Injuries as a child, the time we put our head in the oven, that car accident.  Yet every time we have survived.  It feels like a cosmic entity is prolonging our suffering for some reason.  *It's God's will*, the angel would say.  But I don't know.


Today has been especially hard for some of us.  The baby bearded dragon is still lethargic and will not eat, so we had to force feed him.  The entire day has been spent wallowing in anxiety and existential dread.  We're not used to dealing with such intense emotions, our first reaction is to want to commit suicide to escape them.  We couldn't even make it past noon without heavily considering putting a bullet through our skull.  Browsed some websites, considered calling the suicide prevention line, ended up staring at the ceiling and pondering why and how we're even still alive.  The answer is different for each of us, but none of them are particularly stable or reasonable.


I feel disconnected from the world and the people around me.  I'm dissociating really hard, the angel is probably trying to take control to keep me from doing anything that would hurt our body.  We're going to keep our eyes on the bearded dragon, going to hope that he somehow pulls through.  Maybe we'll just go to sleep.


I'm not sure why we are posting this, why we even made this account.  Some instinctual desire to scream into the void, even if no one hears I suppose.  This account will become the one I vomit all of our sickness into, post whatever the hell we want without worrying what others think of us.  Certain people would probably be able to identify us if they read this, but we don't even care anymore.  Just so long as someone reads it."
"You are laying on a dirty mattress on the floor in the living room (bedrooms lack insulation, too cold) in a mouse infested piece of shite house in a lousy neighborhood. You can't sleep because you are very disappointed. Isn't this where you were a year ago too?


Your boyfriend is snoring away on the futon. You feel guilty for wanting to just get up and abandon him. He is a very lovely person, your soul mate. But he does bring you down quite a bit. You have been with him for over half a decade. You love him. You don't want anyone else. It's just that you want more than this (look around!) and he kind of self sabotages unintentionally. Over and over. And you think, well if he isn't going to come along out of this burning building, that doesn't mean I can't save myself, right?


Oh that hurts. I can't let him die like this. Guess I'll just have to try really really hard and drag him out with me. He isn't refusing to come along...more like dead weight? Oh that's so mean but true. I made the mistake of sitting around for a year while this ""fire"" has gotten worse. I distracted myself thinking ""well whatever it will get better, have a drink!"". No. I was wrong. Hopefully Mike can wake up too and help.

This year, I want to move out of this shithole. I want to go on a vacation somewhere very far away, somewhere adventurous, by myself, without guilt. I want to run faster. I want to get physically much stronger. I want a real fucking bed. And proper bedding. I want a proper kitchen where I can actually feel good about cooking in. No more double washing the dishes (after being used, and then before). No worries about the dog feeding the mice his kibbles (his friends/pets).


I want a good fucking sleep on the night of January 1 - 2."
"There are weird things that contribute to my identity. One of which is strength: emotional, mental, physical. I've always been tougher than the people around me. I dish out exactly what I can take, and I dish out a lot, both positively and otherwise. I like to be a person that others can stand behind for shelter, or go to asking for help and support.

Sometimes I'm afraid, though. I'm afraid when I get sick, or people call me cute, or when I play fight with guy friends. It's a catch-22. They challenge me, so I rise to the ocassion, and then they beat me just to show that they can. It's such a dick thing to do. I don't think they realize that they're damaging my identity, the steel that I place between me and the rest of the world. 

Sometimes I hate myself for not being stronger. 

Then I look back at that tiny little blonde behind me, who is watching to see how she should react when her illness wins, or people belittle her, or men twice my size and three times hers pin her down for laughs, and I turn to face my challenge. I accept my defeat, and win another way. I decide how I handle my illness. I remind that person why 'cute' is the wrong adjective. When the wrestling stops, I make sure they - and everyone around them - knows they've gone too far. My head is high. My heart is full of forgiveness, fire and justice for myself and those that hurt me and others. 

My strength is part of my identity. I've spent my entire life becoming strong. I will learn ways around those who wish to make me feel feeble. I will subjugate them if it means protecting those too weak to live in the world they create. 

I may not be the strongest, but I am not weak. "
"I had counseling today. I needed it. I missed last week due to lack of funds. I was falling off the wagon and spiraling. 

Bill officially moved into an apartment. In my town. 10 blocks away. Super fucking thrilled about that, let me tell ya. 

I heard him drive by the house this morning on his way to work. The sound of MY truck is unmistakable since he cut off the catalytic converter. Fucking idiot. 

He tried to come over last night. I said no. Tonight he tried again. I said no again, meaner, clearer this time. The boys went to his place to see him. They were there for less than 2 hours before he sent them home. 

He did offer to watch them when ever I need. I don't know if he will follow through on that or not. I have a consult tomorrow and so I told him tomorrow would be good and he said he would. So I guess we'll see. 

I don't know why I am here tonight, I am bored. I have pictures to be working on but I don't want to. I WANT to go out. I want to have a drink and loosen up and feel good and forget all this crap that is flying around me.

Mike has been quiet. Eyes wide open, he is using me. His kids are pretty much living here. He is getting free child care. They are getting 3 meals a day here. Last night I sent dinner home for all of them, including Mike. 

He doesn't even say thank you to me for watching them, he doesn't acknowledge the help I am giving him. He has pulled away again. I am figuring him out. He only ever talks to me when I am with Bill or when he needs some thing from me. He is as bad as Bill, maybe worse for knowing what I have been through and still doing it anyway. 

Thats a shame. People are just shitty I guess. Even my brother, who has become Bill's ""good friend"", I can't even trust him anymore. I can't trust anyone. 

Ugh, I don't feel like this is what I want to be doing. I want to have a real conversation with someone. I want to talk all night and feel like I can breathe again when we are through. 

I guess I am going to try for a divorce again. I still haven't printed the papers. Last time it was so much work. Filing them is expensive and if you do something wrong you have to start over and pay to file again. 

Our government is fucking retarded. Why the fuck do we have to pay the government to get married or divorced??? 

Why the fuck do we as human beings trap ourselves into marriages in the first place?? Who though roping yourself legally to another person for the rest of your life was a good idea?? 

Fuck this. "
"I have itchy fingers. Bill was here last night. He wanted to see the boys. Of course after an hour of him being here the kids were forgotten and we fought. I cried a lot. I got an email from him a couple days ago and it was devastating and cruel. It was damaging to me on so many levels. I didn't respond then.

Last night when he started picking at me. Picking on me for things Ihave done I dumped, hard. I cried. I got mad and told him he wasn't allowed to talk about me anymore. I told he wasn't allowed to talk to me the way he had been talking to me. He backed down and said he was sorry. 

He showed up needing a shower. I let him. Needing help with a brand new phone he had gotten. I helped him. He asked for sexual satisfaction at the end of it, I gave it to him. I was so beaten by the end of it I didn't care any longer. 

Today he wanted to borrow my GPS. I exploded on the phone and told him to stop asking me for things, that it wasn't my job to save him all the time. That I didn't have to help him. After the explosion I said yes to the loan. Fuck me I am so weak. 

He came and picked it up and told me I was beautiful, an excellent mood he was in, because he thinks he is getting back in. I just want to escape this. I am so sick of feeling this way. I feel like I can't fucking breathe. He is smothering me and harassing me to the point of being so defeated I give in. And it is harassment. He will not take no for an answer. He makes me feel so shitty for saying no. 

I was lazy at work today. Hung over from the night before, pills and weed and no sleep. I am being destructive, I know. I am just trying so hard to escape the pain. I am making bad choices. I don't even care. I just feel like dying all the time. 

I feel my will for life fading, I find no joy in my job anymore. I shot a wedding this past weekend and I was miserable and desperate to leave the entire time. The things I did love are blank now. I hate everything. 

I just want to put some headphones in and disappear from this place. I want to drink until I can't feel, until I can't remember why I started. I want to walk away, far, long distances away from here. Until I can again draw breathe with out feeling like it may be my last. 

Even though he isn't here I feel so trapped still. He is holding me hostage. Last night he threatened to kill Mike if he ever caught him mowing the yard. He was serious. Everyday it gets a little darker around here. 

The weather matches the days, it is rainy and dark and sometimes stormy, it has been like this for weeks. I love it and I hate it. I keep crying out to God, to the sky, to a being greater than myself to save me from this, to pull me up and out of this miserable mess. I am on my knees desperate to get out. 

I'm paralyzed and I am fading. "
"Dear Diary

Today is the last day of school holidays and I'm not excited to go back to school. The holidays were fun and i was able to make some new friends at a camp I went to.

I'm more scared than anything about school right now, my parents expect great things from me but I might disappoint them. Also I'm not a very social person, I will go out once every three days on average during holidays so my social skills aren't top notch.

I hope this next term will go well for not just me but my friends as well.

I still need a girlfriend though...

-S"
Im going to miss you. Nothing better than staying up till ridiculous hours on a Monday night with good drinks while doing ridiculous shit with friends. Life is so deliciously weird right now and I wouldn't change it for anything.
"Comrades:

Have you ever seen Homer against New York? Well, is the same thing.

Every time I see a person with green eyes my brain hardwires to think that person is a douchebag. I know I shouldn't think that! But I can't help it...now is why:

It started with Cece. She had green eyes. She was not popular and yet she acted like she was (Because in a town with 590.000 habitants, of which about 2% are teens you can be very popular *cough* lies *cough*) 

She was/still is a poser and regularly posts things in Facebook/Tumblr about how cool she is (Gangsta and overly sexual photos… let's just say she’s white), and how bisexual people were being oppressed (did I mention that gay marriage is legal here?) and girls being hot. She struggled to keep a girlfriend (chronic cheating but never getting to third base) and for that she remained virgin as a stone. Cece thought she was popular even if she was not very good at *socializing*

And because she was ""popular"" that meant: Pick on the last person in the food chain, also known as me.

Also, she was so cool she did that by *facebook*

She didn't have the courage to tell me that in my face.

She began to pester me about why I didn’t wear makeup/ why have my hair like I do, and I politely sent her to hell, but no, this story isn’t about Cece, the bitch that stole Christmas ~~and all the prizes at the French speaking competition that I wanted but always something happened to stop me from participating~~  (No, seriously, I was better at French than her. Did I mention that Cece always claimed that she was native French when meeting new people? And from what I have seen her mom and dad are not French…) this is about my most hated person in the world and the reason why god exists and is laughing at me.

Gary.

When I was in eighth grade everybody was talking about the new classmate, a frail-looking, innocent-faced green eyed boy. Which I ignored, because I was minding my own feline business.

I would not have met Gary if we had not won the same Prize, which consisted in a quantity of money if you had certain grades.

There was a long queue. Boys and girls of all the counties were there.

I asked my parents to skip the queue thousands of times but they did not listen, everyone in my class who had gotten the prize was skipping the queue except me, heck even kids from other schools. Then, after four hours I’m in the front of the line. Enter Gary.

With the most cheerful attitude he stepped between me and my parents and asked to be let in first, apparently his dad had a motorcycle accident (what?!) but was fine, when I was going to say “No, sorry, get in the line” he jumped in and went first anyway because fuck my life.

Turns out there was a limited stock of cash, and yes, I was left without a prize that day and had to go another day and it was a mess of paperwork. Nevermind whatever. The next day, all I know is that Gary is apologizing with a smile on his face…full of I don’t know what he was eating that day, but he accidentally spat me in the face with it, he patted me on the shoulder like a kid despite I don’t like being touched but *sigh* okay whatever.

Enter ninth grade. Gary has become a full blown jock and happened the same what happened with Cece, he got other people to hate me and it became a trend to mess with me. One day I was on recess, alone as usual, I forgot of that pipsqueak’s existence for a while, then I noticed a little crowd almost in front of me, and someone from that crowd gets closer and sits down with me.

GUESS WHO?

GARY.

And what he did? He looked me to the eyes, with these HORRIBLE GREEN EYES THAT STARE INTO YOUR SOUL, and asked me for a date.
Gary the jock, Gary the one who got other people to bully me asked me for a date as a joke. Everyone was laughing, I told him that I wasn’t going anywhere with him and he asked again, then he left.

Nevermind whatever (How many times have I said that?! There’s a reason why he’s my enemy!)

One year later, I have to switch schools due to me moving away and there’s no reason why Gary would switch there too, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR, right? ~~Spoiler: He did ~~ I almost had a heart attack when I saw his characteristic little red bag on the first bench the first day of class, there was no way he knew which school I was going to. That year he was worse than usual, something along the lines of a lovechild between Justin Bieber and a goose.

During that year he managed to snatch away from me an old childhood friend of mine (one of the firsts I had) and became his brand new “best friend”…only to tease him too a lot, by this time I was done.

Now there comes the grand prize, by the end of that year one day I was distracted talking to someone else and the next thing I see is his fucking red bag in my bench. He actually sat with me *for no apparent reason* and began to talk to me like *a normal human being* about things that he liked, praised me about how good was I at French, talking to the other person about how we used to be classmates too. I naturally gave short answers and ignored him, and he left without saying goodbye.

There’s more, but he doesn’t deserve a whole diary entry dedicated to him right? Right?!

"Hey everyone,

Ok, not really an update but a kind of notice - the reason the CSS hasn't progressed is because I've had exams for the last month and I've had to focus on them and nothing else. Because of this I haven't been able to try designs out with /u/ri0tnrrd and the CSS is taking way longer than I thought. My apologies. I assure you however that I'll work with /u/ri0tnrrd as soon as I can to do the CSS.

Thanks!

"Moving to a new place is fun and exciting. Making arrangements for said move is not however. I almost forgot how much I hate packing. But despite how tired I am, the realization that I have to get out of here keeps me going. Things have been rough lately, again. I should learn to stop getting too excited when really good things happen because shit always hits the fan shortly afterwards haha. But I'm not going to do that. I'm choosing to remain positive from now on. Which is really weird for me because I feel like I'm the human form of grumpy cat the majority of the time. Scratch that, all the time. With a more aesthetically pleasing face of course ;-*. I read something this week on Facebook that essentially said we are given a life. Not a good life or a bad life but a life. Seems so simple but for some reason that really hit me. Crying doesn't fix things (although it is slightly relaxing sometimes). Neither does wishing for life to be more fair. It's not going to fucking happen so I just have learn to play the cards I'm dealt. I've decided to take those lemons that life keeps relentlessly launching at me, make lemon vodka slushies, and sip on those bitches with a smile. And I'm going to try to do something everyday to make someone happy. Even if it is small and seemingly silly. It seems really cheesy but I can already feel my little grinch heart growing a couple of sizes. 

On a different and much less sappy note I wish my resistance bands and weights would hurry up and get here. I've been feeling really soft and squishy lately. *shudder* No bueno. I feel like I'm getting old. It's not a fun feeling :< I also have been really tempted to buy this dagger. I mean I have been eyeing this beauty for months. I literally salivate looking at the damn thing. But I'll be a little more patient so I can justify the cost lol. It'll be a birthday present to myself. However, I do feel like I need to treat myself after the recent course of events and this Slipknot concert is looking like the move \m/ <3. "
"Yo, listen up! National Geographic magazine is now higher than ever, as the usually informative magazine, in its newest edition titled, ""Weed"".
Still can't find a single page without a corny tick prevention ad. 

Bah-bah-bah-bam! Suddenly, you're hit with an in-explainable sadness. Maybe it's your slimy job as a popcorn vacuumer in that mighty deer's den they call a theater? Or, is it just always being the receiver of snarky looks from mornin' drivers? 

Whichever way you wanna understand it, life just keeps on expanding (like the universe), but, so does your list of ""People I H8"". 

Let's just tear that list apart, knock down those issues, and, start a new, ok?

Great. Please be safe, and, don't try and endanger others similarly to how you endanger yourself every time you text and walk down the marble stairs."
"It has been a long time since I had a dream like this.  
  
A dream you wake up from in ignorance. A dream that felt so real that it makes you question reality for a few seconds. A dream that makes you regret waking up. A dream you try to chase back to with more sleep but experience has taught you it is a futile endeavor. A bittersweet dream that you are happy to have had but will linger in your mind for the unforeseeable future.  
  
I dreamt of a home much like my own except that it was full of life and light. I do not recall entering the house but I remember making my way to the back of the house. I passed the kitchen to be greeted by aunts overjoyed in seeing me and quick to offer me something to eat. I had some pickled cabbage as I made my way to the back of the house. The back room had the sunlight brightly illuminating it's interior. There I met the girl in my dreams. There was nothing really memorable about her and if you were to ask me about her I would only be able to remember her long black hair. She carried an air of familiarity as if I had known her for years but I could not help feeling anxious around her. We left and made our way to the kitchen. I helped myself to a mouthful of pickled radish when an aunt asked us if she was my girlfriend. I was at a loss for words because I did not have an answer. I did not know the answer. The girl in my dreams looked and me and just smiled as she nestled her head on my shoulder. I placed my arm around her and that was the last thing I remember before I woke up.  
  
The second after I woke up, I was happy. Then there was a realization that everything that had happened was a dream. I desperately tried to fall back to sleep but deep down I knew it to be pointless. I just lied in my bed brooding. After some time I tried to recollect the pieces of my dream in attempt to make sense of it, to understand why I wanted to hold onto it so badly.  
  
I realized that it was because I was happy and even though it was a dream, I was happy. I want to have someone by my side. I want to experience a warm embrace. I want to revel in the quick glances and fleeting moments. I want to love and be loved wholeheartedly by a girl of my dreams. I want to be able to remember these things as a memory and not a dream.  
  
It has been a long time since I wanted something like this."
"1.  When I woke up this morning, it was raining lightly and it made me feel very calm and relaxed. It was beautiful. I love listening to the rain that way.

2.  I had a lot of kitteh snuggles this morning, too. I always love when my cats are cuddly and affectionate. It's an awesome feeling to be loved unconditionally that way.

3.  Customers were generally polite at work today, which is always excellent. It's always a win when no one yells at you.

4.  Made plans with a coworker that I haven't seen in a while to hang out for a bit on Tuesday night after we get off. I haven't been able to hang with him for a bit, so I'm looking forward to it.

5.  Spent lunch with another coworker of mine. It's always nice when folks ask me to spend lunchtime with them. Always nice to know your companionship is wanted.

Edit: Why did I post the wrong date? So bad. I am embarrassed. Happy first post, /r/DiaryOfARedditor, and now you can really get a good idea of what a mess I am, hahaha."
"Wait till the end

First of all, - just for some background: My mom died right when I was born, (she was actually really, really hot- but this isn't about her. I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.
Anyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.
I don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).
Sooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.
My friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.
After we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging.
Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.
My friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.
Sadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her. But I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh.
A little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised.
But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone. It was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him. "
"Dear Diary, 

Well the first page is always the hardest page isn't it? So much I need to get out of my head. Let's start with the big one for now. I am not ready to S to leave. Every time I start thinking about it my head starts spinning. I don't even know if he really is leaving but dammit is scares that crap out of me that he might. Don't get me wrong, I am so proud of him for going out for this job, and I REALLY hope he gets it. I truly love him and I want him to succeed, and I would move to the end of the earth to be with him. I just need to know how long I am going to have to be away from him. His interview is tomorrow. He said he would hopefully know more by then. So until then I wait. I wait through this boring day at work. How the hell am I supposed to get anything done?"
"I have been thinking that we, as a (hopefully) budding community should do weekly-check ins where we share a bit of how our week has been. I feel it would help build a sense of closeness and camaraderie with one another."
"I've been trying to ebb away from negative news. I owe myself relief, especially after being bombarded with what's been happening to our world. I never want to see another pandemic for as long as I live.

Today was miserable, and before you say anything, I know what I just said about negative news. But, I'll make an exception in that I get to post anything negative here from my own observations and my mind. It takes the edge off, you know?

The boss was in a 10 hour meeting. Christ Almighty. 10 freaking hours. I start nodding off at a 30-minute meeting, let alone 10 goddamned hours. I would lose my mind. Despite that, he seems much happier than last week. We'll see if that stays the same.

The vendors keep back-ordering a lot of items I've been placing orders on. This sucks. I can't do anything about it, and as I stated in my previous entry, I'm not a wizard who can conjure up these goods out of thin air. 

I looked into that cosmetics/shaving company. They make you do a 200-question IQ test. Seriously. That sounds so stupid and insulting to anyone who earned their education/skills. The company on their website said it's ""necessary"". Barf. I'm starting to have second thoughts about these guys. If this is how they gauge their potential employees, then I hate to think what their work culture is really like.

Wouldn't it be neat if you could slow time down? I wish I had the power to stop it altogether."
"I've spent the last week trying to detox from fentanyl and coke... Out of seven days I ended up getting high three of them. As I sit on this couch right now, and reflect on my week, I worry about the next few days to come. I start a new job tomorrow, in a new office, and honestly right now I have nothing except a suitcase full of clothes and possessions, and a backpack full of the same. Friend of mine said I can stay with him for a little while, while I work in the office with him. Just waiting to hear from him so I can head that way. I want this chapter in my life to be over, but it seems that I just keep writing it. There has to be an ending, I just haven't decided on it yet I guess. All I can do is go with the flow, and see what opportunities come to pass. I can't think about the physical world of reality right now, cuz I am in no shape to deal with it. I need to make it out.…in this dark tunnel I do see a faint light at the end. I just need to walk a little faster instead of crawling and stopping to take a break all the time. Yeah life is hard, but I always seem to make it harder. Always carrying the boulders that have come across in my life. Time to drop the rocks, and lighten the load."
"I feel much better than I did yesterday, physically. I think the fact that I had a bad day with my heart episodes impacted my mental state even worse than I had thought it would. 

Suicidal ideation have sort of faded a tiny bit since I started taking my abilify. I've been doing everything I can treatment wise to get better. 

This brings me to the addiction treatment program I was in: i got discharged! As of two days ago I'm no longer required to go to weekly meetings  :)"
"All I can say is it sucks. You think a diet of nothing but things like ice cream and pudding would be nice until it's all you can eat lol. The paper I was sent home with says that I can start eating soft foods like macaroni starting today (albeit I still have to wait for a bit until it's been a full day). I already miss things like a plain bowl of rice with soy sauce. On another note, they let me keep the teeth they pulled. I don't know what I'll do with them, though."
Everything feels like it's going to shit and there's nothing I can do to even make a difference. It feels like no one cares. Sometimes I wish something terrible would happen to me just so I can justify being so miserable. Unfortunately I'm healthy and even more so no one would care if I got sick anyway. I want to dissolve my body in acid so it's like I never even existed. I hate to imagine the kind of stain my existence has probably put on this planet and I am not deserving of a life
" Right, even tho Im 14, I mentally live in the late 60s rock n roll scene. All the music I like is pretty much between 1950 to 2005, and I’ve never liked K-pop, pop punk, J-Pop/anime ops etc. But today I am questioning my whole reality, I heard an anime OP with a sick bassline and was immediately liking this song and tried learning it on bass.  Now, when I teach myself songs, I usually look up the lyrics to know cues n stuff, but little did I know this song was from Yarichin Bitch club.  So now as an anti-Jop, Punk rocker, I have to live with the fact that one of my favourite current songs is a yaoi op and I can’t play this amazing bassline to anyone because I mean-  it’s a yaoi op."
"I hate how up in her own ass she is. I hate how she always thinks she is right. I hate how she turns every single conversation into a debate, when I am obviously not interested in discussing with her. I hate how she is so over confident that she never takes a second to consider what the others are saying. I hate how she shuts my mom off when my mom is tryjng to add a comment. My sister treats my mom as if she is an uneducated person, she treats our mom with such contempt I wish I could shove a towel into her mouth and ask her to shut the hell up. And I hate how our society encourages her type of behaviour, because most of the time she is considered the eloquent one, while I am the weak and shy one. She is the smart one while I am the incapable one. I hate that I have to be compared to this pathetic person. I hate that being an introvert automatically makes me inferior, being nice makes me weak, being considerate makes me timid, being honest makes me stupid. 

I wish something bad could happen to her someday, which could cause her confidence to crumble like never before, then I can live in peace."
"I'm slowly but surely weaning myself off my remaining painkillers. I think I'll just try to suffer the days through. 

Today was tough. My heart episode made me weak and I think I'm not used to feeling this much pain. I will do what has to be done though."
"It feels a little bit like I have butterflies in my stomach, constantly. Not the nice butterflies either, the angry ""something is very wrong,"" butterflies.

I miss A. Maybe that's where the butterflies come from? From sadness? I looked at his profile and thought about contacting him. However, it's been a while and I doubt he wants anything to.do with me anymore. 

I was going to ask people whether I should but I also strongly believe that the choice of whether or not I contact him is mine so I don't want to seek permission from people. 

...

I discovered a really nice Linkin Park song, so that makes me happy. I will listen to more of their music, most likely tonight."
"I haven't been reading any books. As a matter of fact, I haven't been reading anything, period. And, no, scientific articles from journals don't count. All that data analysis and reading up on methods and materials and whatnot, will drive you insane eventually.

I did have a period where I used to read a bunch of comic books online. Maybe I should take up that habit again. Honestly, reading is relaxing for me. Exercise is good, certainly, and taking a walk around the city can be nice, minus the interesting characters you run into. But I've always had a special spot for reading.

I'm more attached to horror novels, and really, anything that's about things that go bump in the night. Maybe I should start thinking about reading books again.

I was also thinking about revisiting old video games I used to play when I was a kid. Thing is, while it feels good to think about those old games and revisit them, they may not necessarily be good anymore. Sometimes, what you enjoyed back then when you were younger, may not necessarily translate to revived enjoyment now that you're older. I'll often think about playing an old game I used to enjoy, but then after actually playing it again for a few hours, I'll start to regret my decision and ask myself how I ever thought this was fun.

The nostalgic feeling people often refer to are, from what I understand, the warming memories they recall from during that period. Trying to relive them by attempting to repeat it in the present, well, it doesn't always work out. 

There are times where I wish I could rewind the clock and relive certain memories. Hell, I'd love to replay them over and over again like a movie. Unfortunately, sticking to stuff like that can be bad. There's nothing wrong with recalling better memories, but to be stuck there in the past can really make you feel miserable, at least from what I can recall.

Sometimes I'll hear from older adults who tell me it would be great to be a kid again. After all the bullshit me and my family had been through, I'd rather hoof through the pangs of adulthood than to relive the clusterfuck of childhood and adolescence. Seriously, I wouldn't trade them for the world.

I'm feeling slightly better tonight."
"I just can’t get through any day without making mistakes, without being stupid and without breaking down. 

I hate myself so much. It’s been a rough couple of years. I’m so done. I keep on trying to find reasons to stay. 

I don’t want to leave but there’s no place for me. 
I’m a stupid piece of shit. Every time I see a person smile at me, all I feel is incredible guilt, because they would feel bad after I left. 

But I have no choice. Leaving is the only way for me to take control over my own life. 

Sometimes I wish I was physically smaller, so smal that people forget I exist and just let me be. Or maybe so small that they just tolerate my existence. Something slightly inconvenient but it’ll cost more effort to remove. 

Such pathetic existence. 

I do feel incredibly guilty. The pain that I might cast upon others for my own selfishness. I hope they know that I still love them dearly and only wish the best for them. This just seems like an appropriate ending for me. I’ve done nothing useful my whole life and now I leave without any significant impact. 

I have already think about that day. I wouldn’t live like it’s my last day. It’ll be too sad. I’ll just go about with my day, eat something fancy maybe. And then I’ll wait until everyone is asleep. It’ll be nice. No one will notice. I think the easiest way is to jump. Because I know how to and I have access to a high place, to guarantee success. 

Even though I don’t want to, I have no other options."
"Our friend in the family is getting better, apparently. He says that his episodes of fevers are going away, but now they're replaced by what he calls ""chills"". Even though a chill is usually an onset of a fever, his body temperature is normal, according to him and his wife. Even so, he'll have to be making sure everything is fine until his doctor says he's absolutely okay to return to work.

Honestly, I'd tell him to take a whole month off if he can. Going back to work immediately after going through something like that, I can only imagine, would be too much of a toll on someone. I don't know about his financial situation, but I'm hoping that he doesn't try breaking himself from this.

I'm starting to feel much better myself. Still, I'd prefer to see a doctor.

Not much to say about this entry other than that.

Tomorrow's Friday!"
"last year i got to travel a bit bc of my new school. i miss it all so much. i miss going to new places and exploring with good company. and im such a city person, so lately ive been listening/watching some city ambiance videos and happened upon one captured from nyc. the guy is just walking through the busy streets of nyc and its even raining. and you can hear all the honking and stuff too. its better when you're higher up like in a hotel room though lol. but regardless, it's a nice change from the same plain suburbs. i also noticed that not a lot of people were wearing rain coats and jackets, just mostly ponchos. i could never just wear regular clothes and come out with just an umbrella, i'd lowkey feel too ""exposed"" lol. i also really miss the rain. we've barely been getting rain nowadays, it's so sad."
"I hate myself. I really do. It’s just background noise at this point. Every time I look in the mirror. My day gets a little bit worse. 

I’ve been alone for so long. Nothing has gone as planned. Every year it gets worse, and more embarrassing. 

I want another reason to live. Something besides survival. I am unhappy. Nothing brings me joy. I just exist mindlessly. Until it all hits me at once. Just like today. Multiple years have passed. And I’ve not lived in one of them. I’ve been suffering for so long. Its just background noise at this point. It never gets better. If it did you’re lucky. And I honestly hate you. Because I wish it would for me."
"I sometimes get this. Mostly after these meetings. I am very expressive. I speak when I feel like something is worth saying. But then I get this feeling that it was not received well, or people think that I am stupid or that I am not qualified to speak. Sure some people are judgemental towards me. Sure some of them doubt me. Why do I have to take their opinion? Why do I have to subscribe to their judgement. When I feel insecure like this, I try thinking of ways that they will accept me, applaud me. 

Fuck their judgement. FUCK THEM. I KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO AND I KNOW WHERE I HAVE TO GO. SURE I AM NOT PERFECT. BUT THESE NEGATIVE FEELINGS ONLY BRING ME DOWN. I WILL KEEP PUSHING FORWARD. I AM NOT GOING TO DROWN THESE FEELINGS WITH ALCOHOL OR WEED. MY WORK WILL SPEAK FOR ITSELF. I DON'T GIVE A SHIT WHAT THE WORLD THINKS OF ME. I KNOW MYSELF AND MY INTENTIONS. THEIR JUDGEMENT DON'T DEFINE ME. IF THEY HAVE SUGGESTIONS I WILL CONSIDER THEM. THESE SILENT JUDGEMENT, EVEN IF THEY EXIST IN MY HEAD. I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THEM. 

I have been underestimated all my life. By my parents, teachers. FUCK ALL OF THEM. I am working on myself and this is just an intermediate phase and it will be better if I keep moving forward. No reason to feel down. It is all part of the process. The mess before the cleanliness. Accept it and keep moving. I am proud of myself, my positivity and honesty.  I am persistent and I don't give in to external pressure. I can fight the whole world if I have to for my values."
"Give me more, give me the end of the world. I want to taste it, like copper in my mouth, to feel the burn of a thousand shattered pieces in my skin. As I stand there staring up at the night sky being cut by a million meteorites crashing into the earth, while we all stand still, I want it to hurt."
"I let myself felt

I let myself thought

I let myself opened my mind

I let my feelings drifted by itself, so I have to accept it and take responsibility for my own feelings and the consequences after that.

&#x200B;

As I told you,

You need to take responsibility for your heart.

You need to deal with your feelings as well.

Whether it is the feeling that we have,

Or the feeling that happened to someone.

&#x200B;

No one could replace each other.

&#x200B;

From being alone all along, could be happy on my own.

&#x200B;

Eat alone

Go alone

Watching a movie alone

Living alone

&#x200B;

I always had loneliness as a friend. Therefore I never felt that loneliness was scary.

It was pretty good, actually.

As the people around them demanded time for themselves.

Instead, I had plenty of time to listen to my feelings.

&#x200B;

Then one day

Someone walked in

&#x200B;

Having a friend to talk with

Having a friend to eat together

Having a friend to watch movies together

&#x200B;

No matter what I do, there was someone to think about.

&#x200B;

Haven't met Loneliness for such a long time.

Is Loneliness going to be...lonely?

&#x200B;

It's true, that I felt happier. Because I did open my heart for someone to walk in

Came in as an element of happiness.

&#x200B;

It's totally not your fault at all.

Actually, it's my fault. Who opened the way and accepted you in.

&#x200B;

As we talked about last night.

You leave me in the same place as before I met you.

&#x200B;

It's not a duty that you must be jumping in,

That what if I can be happy on my own.

&#x200B;

After that, who should I talk to?

After that, who should I eat with?

After that, are watching movies is going to be fun anymore?

Am I going to be lonely?

Would everything be okay?

&#x200B;

It's my duty.

To find a way to get back to my old home.

To remember how I lived before.

&#x200B;

It's my duty to take responsibility for my heart,

Manage all of my feelings.

Both the feelings that had just happened and had already collapsed.

&#x200B;

Will throw it in the trash?

Will burn it to dust?

Will put it in a memory box?

Will admit that it was a beautiful past and let it go?

&#x200B;

Well, no matter what I choose to do,

I have to admit that we are just close friends.

As it should be, as it always means to be.

&#x200B;

You remember how well I was last night, right?

I'm so sorry that I lied to you.

Even I've prepared for it, for several months. But still though.

&#x200B;

I let myself loved you. I gave you a piece of my heart to you.

And there is no way to recall it back.

Don't blame anyone, if something is not what we want it to be.

This is the way our lives means to be after all.

&#x200B;

Why do you keep circling around someone?

When I revolve around you like the moon

I can’t take a step closer to you

You know how this feels too.

&#x200B;

You are the earth, the center of my day."
"

I find comfort in writing, although I may not be the best writer, I’ll take what I can get. Today I find myself needing comfort. Today was tough. I find its hard for me to verbally express how I feel, but writing often helps. 

Today I feel lost. Lost in my path of life, feeling like I am losing the things around me. Maybe I’ve been too distant, too distracted with the thoughts inside my head. You know the all-consuming ones. I feel like I’ve lost touch with myself and I am working to find that again. I want to find that carefree, happy girl I used to be. But recently, I’ve been bogged down in the everyday routine and stress. I'm not entirely sure what my end goal is, but I know that I haven't reached it yet. I feel like I am not actually living my life, but going through the motions instead. Maybe I write this with the hope that someone out there feels the same way."
"Dear Toast, 

Today was okay-ish. It was my first day at no-fap and it went pretty well. I ended up over eating a ton of junk once more and felt like my stomach was gonna blast, but the urge to keep on eating didn't end. I'm gonna start eating healthy once more.

Today is the date I started getting close to my bestie. One year anniversary of us togather- fighting against all odds and creating a lunatic world of our own. Although she gets on my nerves sometimes, I still love her a lot. She's a silly and impulsive idiot who can fight everyone for my sake. She's cute at times lmao. I'm glad for having her in my life. 

Today was pretty normal to start with. I over slept once more and woke up at 3:10 pm. I had a pretty nice brunch - curd and rice with onions. I like curd rice. I then did a part of my assignments and notes till dinner. I made myself apple cinnamon oats smoothie which turned out pretty well. And this was the time when my over eating cycle began. After my dinner, I had a wierd craving to eat whatever was available and I ended up filling myself with rice, bread, chips, cheetos, cereal and corn puffs. 

I got a stomach ache because of all the over eating. But I kept on eating more till I ran out of food in store. I hate myself for this. 

I also tried out my new clothes, they fit pretty fine except one or two dresses, which needs a bit of alterations from the near by tailor. It's 2:48 right now. I must sleep. I'll get up early tomorrow, do some workout, meditate, shower, eat healthy and do something productive. I'll try my best. 

I'm yet grateful for being surrounded by people who love me and care for me, and being privileged enough for being able to live a life as such. I'm grateful for everything I have which other people might not. I'm grateful for the privilege of all the necessities required for living a comfortable life and for my parents who are always trying to fulfill every little wish of mine. I'm also grateful for my over dramatic family for they love me so much. Thankyou God for everything. I'm blessed to have this life. I'm happy that I'm still alive. 

I know everything will get better soon and every difficulty will pass. I have faith in myself and the universe. I have faith in the Divine! 

Good Night. Peace out!"
"The occasion came and went.

You came to mind and went.

I'm glad you didn't say shit.

It might've made me sick.

&#x200B;

Still a part of me wanted to hear something

Still a part of me waits patiently

you know it's best to ignore me

to guarantee I feel the pain.

&#x200B;

you let me off the hook

was your hook ever nearby?

has it ever seen this water?

&#x200B;

"Say hi to the new lab manager! Yup, I made my farewells to my mentor on Friday, as she leaves for a much more lucrative (hopefully) job. By default, I got the promotion and am taking her place. And with that, comes more responsibilities and management skills. 

Yeah...that's really the only ""good"" part. I put good in quotations because, even with this promotion, my pay hasn't gone up, not yet, anyway. Next week will be my work anniversary, with me being there for one year now. I'm hoping the boss will give me a pay-raise, though it's up to the accounting guys at the hospital, not him. 

Actually, that's not entirely true. As I did state before in older entries, my paycheck comes from the grant money given to us, and rarely, from our private benefactors. In other words, if the boss decides to give me a raise, he'll have to notify the grant officer of our research, for both private and public funds. As convoluted as it sounds, this is all part of the record-keeping that's necessary for our funds to keep going into the research operation's coffers. In other words, they need to keep track of all finances--and I do mean *all*. 

That means even if they raise my paycheck by a cent, they have to report it to the team who're involved in that record-keeping. Yes, seriously. In the past, and I'm sure even now, there have been cases of fraud where people have abused (read: stolen) grant money and pocketed it for themselves.

I don't think it's too much to ask, but considering it's academia, unless I'm a postdoc or the P.I. themselves, I'd probably have a better chance of turning water into wine. Regardless, I have to approach the Professor in a cool and collected manner. I've earned his trust at this point, so as long as I don't come off as a pest or am asking for too much, I think I should be okay.

Now that I'm the manager, I'll have to plan each day carefully, and I should plan ahead for the day after and the one after that too. Ugh, I'll have to tackle much more things now, but it won't be impossible. Thing is, we're now understaffed even more, and tomorrow, one of my coworkers isn't coming in. I hope this doesn't kill me.

I need to take better care of myself. This job doesn't exactly grant me too much social life, and with this ongoing pandemic, it's hindering it even more. With that being said, we're expecting another surge of the virus, now that winter is coming up. I need to go in for my flu shot tomorrow, so that should be good, but COVID is still hanging around with more and more people out and about.

I really hope we don't go back into quarantine, but it seems like a plausible reality at this point. The last thing we need is another toilet paper panic-fest. There won't be anything I could do other than to keep on keeping on. At least this weekend will be a long one for me, because I get the day off next Monday for the Saturday shift.

So, this is our lives now? Wake up, go to work, go back to sleep, and repeat? It's always been like that, hasn't it, though? I don't really like to think about it that way, and I'm hoping it'll be my turn next. I've made my decision that I'm staying for another year, or, if things don't improve or get too crazy, a half a year. But, thing is, I have to make damn sure I'll secure a job before leaving, otherwise I'll be in job-hunting limbo again.

Let's see where this takes me. Have a nice day."
"It was mostly an uneventful day because I don't have school, I don't have work, and my parents are out of town for a while. So I mostly stayed at home, relaxed, got some cleaning done, and decided to finally vacuum my bedroom. It was good that I took the time to do that because it has been a couple of weeks since I have had the motivation to do anything related to clean up in my bedroom.

I didn't have much in the way of chores or prepping for work, so I just got a lot of small stuff done which in the end still is stuff that needs to be done. I got laundry done, I watered my plants, I did the dishes, and I just had a really relaxed day overall. 

In the afternoon I went and saw my friend, we went to the Cheesecake Factory in the mall and did some Pokemon Go raids since today was the last raid hour for Heatran... honestly I don't like Heatran that much but it is good to get a few to build up the squad for more raids in the future. I was exhausted and when I got home I just wanted to lay in bed and cry. Honestly for no reason other than to just let everything out that has been building up inside for a few days and I may just go and do that after I finish writing. 

I never used to cry, but recently it has felt good to just go and let everything out. I try to keep that side to myself and put a happy front on whenever I go out or text and message people. I think sometimes it's easier to not tell people everything thats going through my head because it would be too hard to explain, or maybe they will get upset at me for telling them. Just head down and push through it... alone. 

\-Love always,

J."
"Today I had an interesting last day at my new but now old job. It was a super chill morning and the rest of the day was kind of slow, all up until around 5pm. That is when it got crazy. I was the only person on the floor since the other guy went on his lunch break and all of a sudden everyone showed up for shopping. It was kind of crazy how busy it got because I wasn’t really in it to be there for efficiency, so I told people to wait as I helped others instead of just taking everything onto myself. It felt good to be able to just ask people to be patient because they usually aren’t. 

After that I just sort of stopped caring as much over what it was that I needed to do, so I just sort of went home and relaxed. I had dinner and watched the first episode of the second season of The Boys which was super exciting. I love that show! I’ll probably watch the other two episodes that have been released tomorrow or Monday depending on if any of my friends want to hang out. 

I also realized that I don’t have any clothes for my new job so I’ll have to take a look and maybe go shopping tomorrow or Monday for new workout clothes that I can wear to work at my new job. I need casual athletic wear with no logos (except for the new company). 

I am also very tired because I didn’t sleep well last night, so I will probably go to bed soon after I finish writing this. But other than that I think I will go and read for a while, watch a movie in a blanket fort I made, and maybe listen to some music while I fall asleep. 

-Love always,
J."
"I may have made a friend but I am unsure. I have no idea how to be a friend so that is something I will work on.

But today I am babysitting the tiny human in my life and she has begun walking. She looks like ET walking and it is the most adorable thing I have ever seen.

A friend of my brother bought her a little bumper car and showed her how to drive it and she has been zooming about all week and that is cute as well, but being alone with her in her own environment instead of at my house where it is not child proofed so she cannot just walk around is very refreshing.

She has picked up singing from me, one of the only good things I have to offer sub par that it may be, and is just going about her day eating banana muffins and humming a little tune while wandering around.

It is strange for me to feel content. I have not felt content in years. Boy have I been missing out just muddling through depression instead of simply letting my mind calm down and simply existing.

And now she has a pen so I will leave this here."
"It's not that late right now, only around 6:30pm but I am really tired. Both mentally and physically. Physically because I worked out really hard last night and I didn't get much sleep. Mentally because my mind has been doing a lot of thinking in the past 20 hours. I was sitting with one of my close friends today having Tapas at this place in downtown. We got lamb, octopus, and this brie flat bread thing which was really good. I want to go get the ingredients to make it one of these days.   
I honestly don't feel like writing today because I just feel too down to do anything. I think I am just gonna go lay down in bed, blast some music, and maybe figure out how I should move forward.

\-Love always,

J."
"I had an awful nightmare last night, more disturbing than usual. I remember I was walking through, if I can recall correctly, a dark alleyway that lead up to a mansion. I went inside and was greeted by a child, maybe a boy? He looked at me and said that he was scared of dying, and said that there was ""nothing but silence and darkness"" after we die. Then, the dream ended and I woke up shaking a bit, and when I checked the time, it was five in the morning.

Now I know that that sounded cheesy and edgy, and I'm sure many will find it laughable at what the kid in my dream said. Thing is, it wasn't really the words that got to me. It was the mannerism in which they spoke. It felt as if they were talking directly to me. 

I sound confusing, so let me explain. Usually when you dream, at least from what I've experienced over the years, you're almost always the spectator. You can somewhat interact with the ""entities"" in your dreams, but you can never really control anything. The best way I can describe it is that you're forced into watching a movie, but instead, you're on a roller coaster and everything seems to be shifting and warping all around you.

I felt as if I wasn't a spectator in that nightmare. They say that we experience nightmares because of something or someone that's bothering us. 

Am I afraid of dying? I guess the fear of death never really occurred to me. I always thought that the fashion of how you die would be the worst part, and not necessarily death itself. 

Maybe I am afraid of what happens next. I really don't like to think about it.

Anyway, that's all I wanted to talk about. I'll enjoy what's left of this Saturday night and get ready for an even more sleepy Sunday.

Sweet dreams, I hope."
"Today at work I was supposed to do training from 11:30-5pm but they had me work the floor from 11-7:15pm. I actually had a good day looking back on it. I get to dress up and be myself more than I could at my old store. I love dressing up and wearing cologne and being able to do nicer things as a job. It's also super nice that it's commission on top of the base salary. I need to make sure I don't get too addicted to the commission based salary though, my mom told me to watch out for that. I went out and got Panda Express for lunch and it was really good! I haven't had Panda for a while. I do need to pack my own lunch because it will be expensive if I go out and buy lunch everyday, so next time I will probably buy more lunch food to cook for myself to bring to work from now own. 

After work I went and visited my old store and it was nice to see some familiar faces but I do need to make more friends to hang out with. It's been an interesting time for me trying to be my own person outside of all of my social groups but I don't think going out cold turkey is the best way to go. I need to slowly move forward because any progress is still progress. 

Tomorrow I get to see one of my best friends for the first time in a long time, and I really miss talking to her. I miss knowing how her day's have been going and I miss telling her about the going ons of my day. But it's good to take some space sometimes to figure out who I am without these other people in my life. Because I know I can live without people in my life now, but that the fact is that my life is enhanced with her in it, but doesn't revolve around any one person in particular. 

I really like the watch I bought, and it has honestly not made me want to wear my Apple Watch anymore because the feeling of something mechanical on my wrist feels amazing. I do need to separate myself from my dependency on technology and the instant gratification I constantly get from social media, texting, and buying things online. But I do honestly think I have been getting better. 

Tomorrow I have my presentation of my quarter long project for one of my classes and I am excited to no longer worry about it anymore. After the class tomorrow I only have to attend a zoom session on Thursday and then I have 4 weeks off. So working full time I'll still have my evenings open and the two days off during that period. I just need to make sure I have my class schedule finalized and the time off approved at work and if not I'll figure out some other thing to do in the mean time. 

Anyways, that's pretty much everything that I have planned for today and tomorrow. Oh crap I need to take out my laundry out of the dryer. I think I'll end it here tonight... one last thing is that I have been listening to a lot of Powfu and I think I need to find happier music lol. 

\-Love always,

J."
"I like writing diary.
I keep a digital diary at a place called ‘journey’ 
Somehow, I got up very early today (say around 2 am)
I was listening to some songs and podcasts.
Our attention and interests don’t last long.
We get bored after a time.
If something ‘new ’ turns up we feel excited or happy about it for some time.
This idea made me happy.
Why not write my diary at this community today and make this my journey entry too.
If this is a successful...I shall make my diary (write my diary) here too.
I have not done much at Reddit... shall at least try this.
Have I done this in diary format?
[Real]
This first post here was rejected, because I have not understood the posting method.
Hope this will be posted..
The second attempt was also rejected. I did not post brackets for the date.
Hoping this will be a success."
"About a month ago I (F) took the plunge and confessed to my colleague (M). I am already expecting the worst from this. The only reason I’m actually confessing is 45% to clear my conscience and 55% with hopes he’ll feel the same way as well. 

So I let the 55% get the best of me and told him to first hear me out and save his feedback until he’s sure of how he feels and has formed a coherent thought about it. (When in fact I have a gut feeling I’m just delaying the painful rejection.)

I would say he took the news steadily. I was pretty calm after that moment but first week at work post confession was a killer for me, honestly (surprise, surprise). We both didn’t know how to behave around each other. But eventually, I think things are working out. We’re falling back into the rhythm pre-confession. Which is confusing me since we’re quite close to each other and we get each other. Think finishing each other sentences, anticipating what the other wants before they say anything, knowing the other person’s tastes and preferences, kinda close. We basically have awesome chemistry.

The issue here now is that he hasn’t got back to me and I am absolutely curious about what he has to say about me confessing and I have no idea how to go about this without scaring him off or making it worse between us. On the other hand however, I selfishly think he should be the one following up but I guess the passiveness speaks volumes. 

I guess we’re both in uncharted territory considering this is my first time confessing to someone and he’s never had a girlfriend before. 

Now I’m just racking my brain on how to move on from something that never happened. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
"Hey, I’m back, 

I’m currently lying in a black room at 9:45 PM with rivers going down my fucking cheeks. I don’t know why. 

I really hope everyone’s staying safe during quarantine. Seriously, where a goddamn mask, social distance. Don’t go in another persons house. Just fucking do it right. 

That’s not why I’m typing this. I don’t know why. I needed someone to talk to and this is the only way I feel comfortable. I don’t have anyone to talk to about how I feel. Which is why I feel so shitty too! Funny how that’s often how it works. I feel awful, and the fact I have no one to share it with makes it way worse. Funny how empathy is actually helpful 

But I don’t have anyone to talk to because the one person I feel like I could talk to almost anything is now my ex (she’s also dating her ex after telling me that she could never have feelings like that, I’m not upset about that honestly it’s just funny and uncomfy) but even tho she says she wants to be friends I just can’t. I’m a burden on my other friends with mental health problems. I can’t talk to my family bc they just pity me and I’m trapped inside this goddamn house which I have been since March. I’ve been full on quarantining, masks every time I leave the house etc. since March. I haven’t touched a person outside my immediately family in 5 months. I could really use a fucking hug. 

I also like pretending to my therapist I’m better off than I am just so he doesn’t have to worry. 

I just don’t want to have to deal with this anymore. The repeating. The living in limbo. The just feelings of pain over and over. JESUS CHRIST IM BEING MACBRE. SORRY

"I had a dizzy spell today, and I know why it happened. Basically, I had to get a procedure done on my ears yesterday and it left me getting dizzy spells. On top of that, I skipped breakfast and felt like crap. I left work early, which I rarely do unless it's a good reason, but I did have one.

This entry is pretty much nothing. I don't want to go to work tomorrow. Honestly, my heart isn't into it right now, even though I am doing well. My previous entry last night was something else, but I did mean a lot of what I said. It'll be fine, I'm sure, but I still feel as if I could be doing more for myself. I did keep talking about taking another job, but I think it would break me at this point.

Even as I'm writing this, I don't feel tired at all, and I've been awake since 5:00 AM. I've become so conditioned to this new lifestyle that being tired doesn't faze me as much anymore. And, maybe this sounds stupid, but I've become more and more selfish. I mean that in regards to me taking better care of myself and not getting involved in other people's businesses, something that I used to do in my younger years.

I've gotten so used to being surrounded by angry and mentally deranged people since childhood, that I owe myself a break. I don't think there's anything conceited about that.

That's it. Maybe I'll buy a new video game to keep my mind occupied after work tomorrow."
"Dear D

It's the second week of my stay at grandpa's. My grandma is the typical dotting and loving kind and it's really sweet until it fucks up your workout regimen and diet.
Everytime i am at the table, she would insist on taking ""some more (enter a dish)"" or to have ""another slice of bread"" and   i feel shitty turning them down again and again.
It was no different until i got this idea (which is really nothing eureka-ish.) I told her how saying no so many times is affecting my psyche and must be impacting her too. So i requested her to ask me in the negative. For instance, ""you won't want more curry, right?"" That way there'll be so many ""yes""s.
I don't think it's something huge. but it will somewhat make both of us less cranky. :)"
"It's Valentine's Day in my country. I managed 5 days without any alcohol, but today was too much. I'm obviously drunk while writing this, in some fucked up part of my town. Some guy is pissing on some plants while I write right in front of me. Nevertheless, seeing the town, seeing all the closed bars and open gas stores (thanks for that, otherwise I wouldn't be able to get my hands in any alcohol) it filled me with a sense that it's all temporary. You can't control what's gonna happen. Things can and will change, for the best and the worst, all the fucking time. And you can't let it kill you. You've got to push through the shit and don't allow yourself to wallow too much in your own misery. It's nearly impossible to deal in a healthy manner with everything that is happening right now, but what else can I do? I won't kill myself. So I have no other choice but try to build something out of all this pain. Acknowledging that all I am is of my own making. It's Valentine's Day in 2020, and I'm staring at a blank wall, close to Severo's, thinking of you, L. I'm still loving you - Scorpions in my earbuds. Fuck. Fuck. Is there really no chance to start once again?"
"I am Sad

I am sad. Part of me wants to break down crying, the other part of me has pretty much completely dissociated by now. I get a few things done at work and then find myself gazing into the distance. I just want to be all alone in a dark room.

Every minute tickets by... Sometimes the hour flies, sometimes 15 minutes drag by. I just want to be all alone in a dark room.

My tummy is knotted with hunger, but I don't feel like eating. Food sounds disgusting. My mouth is dry, I try pouring water down my throat when I can remember. I want to curl up in a dark room for days, I don't want to talk or listen, I don't want to watch TV or even think. I want to be in silence. Yet I want to be surrounded by my family and friends, I want their love and attention, their support. I want to WANT a big yummy dinner to fill up my tummy. I just want to be all alone in a dark room.

I want to help someone have a better day, but every word they speak pushes me further in my hole. I feel like I'm choking on nothing, my own air. I feel like my ears are burning when people talk to me, everything is so intensely annoying. I just want to be all alone in a dark room.

I thought the justice from the sentencing hearing on Monday would bring closure/peace, but instead, it feels like a tornado ripped through my brain again. I've tried to surround myself with loved ones/people that make me happy, I've tried to treat myself and do some serious self-care over the last few days.... I'm still just here feeling sad and lonely. I just want to be all alone in a dark room."
"Finally found a girl that I would genuinely would love to be with. There's so many things going through my head. Please answer back, I want to talk and be with you.

"Today teachers were required to finalize grades for the seniors, and so despite the school year technically ending on the 22nd, I guess I have just effectively graduated high school. 

Yet, there's something about the pompous nature of graduation that runs so contrary to how I feel, that it almost physically hurts. How can I possibly celebrate what has been the worst four years of my life? The close relationships I never made? The academic excellence I desired for so desperately but could never get myself motivated enough to achieve? 

It hurts all the more because it feels as though I tried so hard, yet at the same time I'm horrifyingly cognizant of the fact that I didn't try as much as I should've. I slacked off when I shouldn't, I pushed assignments back until the last minute. Truth be told, I'm getting exactly what I deserved.

My only solace is that in college, I will have yet another chance to redefine myself. Perhaps my last chance to do so meaningfully. I can only hope that I won't waste it.

\*I know this might seem a bit weird given the topic of the post, but i'm trying to improve my writing so if there's anything you think could've been expressed a bit more smoothly, or if you notice any of the grammar mistakes I'm famous for, please tell me."
"Im 25 I'm still watching movies at 2 am still have chronic depression. I still date guys from the internet most of my friends are either from the internet due to location 
I was raped 
I graduated college 
Still don't have a liscense 
Still experiencing insomima bouts 
Still have deep depression dives
Watching movies that seem to echo my head's intrusive thoughts or otherwise 
My life feels at a complete standstill as well as if I'm leaping off a cliff all at once"
"There is none anymore.   


Was so afraid that I will lose myself in a relationship and become dependent that I set up these calendar event every two weeks to see how things are going, am I getting too dependent? Am I losing myself? Look at it now, it died before it can start. Funny, na?"
"I am tired of fighting

I am so tired of fighting. It seems like my life has been a fight against one health problem or another for as long as I can remember and I am so tired. I really wonder what the point is sometimes. I vacillate between wondering what’s the point and telling myself that I’ll fight on until it’s all figured out and I’m better and functioning. 

I am tired of feeling like a disappointment to my parents who just want me to graduate college and succeed. I’ve had so many set backs with my college career, it’s ridiculous. 

I’m tired of my girlfriend not feeling like she can count on me because it just keep being pushed further back when we can have a life together because my medical issues keep fucking up my schooling and graduation date.

Sometimes it makes me wonder if I’m worth all the energy that my family and girlfriend and friends put into helping me since I just seem to have problems. 

I thought I’d finally escaped my health problems and figured it all out when I left the house I was recently living at. After over a year of health issues that seemed to get better and then worse we figured out there was mold at the house and I was highly allergic to it. It explained all my problems I’d had over the past year and a half and why all the fixes were just band aids. 

I came home to my parents house to quarantine with them since I had been staying at a family friend’s near my college. I had been feeling much better while out of the house with mold. I was walking four or five miles a day and had energy for the whole day. Yet after I came home to my parents house I slowly started to feel worse again. 

Now I haven’t felt awake in weeks and I’m pretty depressed. I took a test that indicates I’m exposed to mold so my doctor thinks there’s mold at my parent’s house. We’re working on getting my parents house tested and treated as well as getting me allergy shots/drops so I’ll be immune.

It’s just so frustrating. I really am so tired of fighting. It seems like that’s all I know how to do sometimes. It’s hard not to give up. Sometimes I feel like I’d rather be dead then have to live like this. I’ll keep fighting though. It’s all I know. I just wanted to write this somewhere. Keep me in your prayers if you want!"
" 

My Dad passed from this life over 10 years ago. I am so happy that I had a chance to get know him better during his last years and was able to reconcile many of the unresolved feelings that I carried for him from my youth. There are still so many uncomfortable feelings and hurt that linger on, so I decided to attempt to write my way to understanding and freedom and I wanted to post a portion of my thoughts here.

My Dad was a hard man. He was not only hard to get to know but a harder man to love. He kept everyone including his wife and children at a distance. He was a Baptist preacher and was an authoritarian. His opinions on life and his world view were law in his world and his home. He was closed minded in everything he believed. He was rigid in every sense of the word. There was an emotional price to pay if you voiced opinions that differed from his or dared to question his authority.

I want to know why you would tell your son in my sophomore year of college, “I guess you think you are better than me now”, and I replied no Dad, that is not how I feel. In looking back, I believe he wanted a confrontation with me. He had a huge inferiority complex with people who had educations.

Sometimes I think he hated me when I was a kid, because I had strong agnostic beliefs and he could not force his political and religious views on me. I must say that I tried it his way, but the hypocrisy was killing me. He called me a Marxist and a punk, because he caught me reading what he thought was subversive. I spend a great deal of my youth on drugs and alcohol and eventually ended up addicted to heroin, cocaine and was a hard-core alcoholic.

He could not tolerate weakness in those that could not control their liquor or drugs but was a slave to nicotine that ultimately killed him through COPD. He was forever happy that I got sober, but never got over the fact that I could not accept his beliefs.

I have to say that I went to treatment more than 10 times. The treatment centers in the beginning were more like resorts, but the last years I was in free treatment with poor and indigent people. A black American man & and a Mexican American ended up giving me message of recovery and this changed my Dad. I saw this man with all his prejudice and hatred for things different embrace my mentors and he really changed before my eyes.

In the last years we talked daily, and he was very interested in what I was doing and where I was going with my education and career. One of the last things he told me was he just needed to know that I was going in the right direction and he was satisfied that I was. The old man had really mellowed over time. I love him with all of his flaws and have grown in the fact that realize that I have flaws too, and want my children, family, and friends to accept me. Thank you for reading and listening to my struggles for freedom."
"I really can't believe less than a day ago I posted on here without knowing what would happen. I am broken. I am sad. 

I just ended things with my girlfriend. A girl who I had loved and cared about for more than a year. A girl who didn't want me for months, broke up with me before, and caused me more happiness than anyone I really know. I know that we needed to break up. I know it was the right thing for me, but it hurts more than anything. I'm just remembering how wonderful she is right now. None of the negative only the positive. I'm thinking about our cuddles, our walks, our deep discussions. I know I needed to do this, I know it was what was best for both, that she also didn't support me. She emotionally manipulated me, she made me feel horrible, but she still cared for me.

She said, ""I always have nightmares, and when I go to bed thinking of us together I feel better."" That broke my heart. That made me feel like nothing and so completely sad. But I know we needed to. It's been a long time coming. She never imagined this. She's always thought it would be her to end things, like she always had. I need to say this, I slightly cut myself tonight. I know I'm just remembering the good, and none of the bad, but I just need to say it. I love her. I still care about her. I just can't be with her. I know it doesn't make sense, but I know it's right. I'm a dick. I'm a bad person. 

I hope I die."
"I'm scared. 

Overwhelmingly scared. 

I keep telling myself it's a bad dream. 

That somehow, this virus will escape us...

It's only a matter of time."
"I'm going to preface this with four things: One, this has been pulled from a diary entry that I spent a good deal of time writing tonight. This is the sixth volume (notebook) that I have filled up with entries. Two, I know that my grammar isn't perfect. This is the first and only draft that I'll ever write of this because it's real and flawed, just in the ways that think I am. Three, I am posting this here because I wonder if anyone else has felt the same way that I do or has their own stories to tell. Four, My mother (who I will be calling Tabitha in this) is abusive. She's been this way my whole life. Not in a drinking, hitting kind of way, but a verbal behind closed doors, emotional kind of way. I have been dreaming of getting out of this hellhole for years. Here we go

   03/07/2020                                                                                                                                    7:13 PM

Okay, so I just read entry 57 of volume one. I agree with it, actually. I thought that I'd feel different, but I don't. I still want out, just as badly I suppose. That being said, I don't think it will be a cure all for the problems that I have. Yes, a lot of my problems will be gone simply because my mom, the woman causing them, won't have nearly as important a role in my life as she does now. I think it's imperative that I stay here at least until my graduation party. I need that money. The faster I can get money, the faster I can get the absolute hell out of here. Graduation party= Money. Then I have my job at (undisclosed place of work), and lastly, I'm going to sell feet pics for however much money I can scrounge up out of the dark corners of the internet. In truth, I'd send pictures of myself doing anything (except my face, of course) for money. I'd be doing it right now if I didn't share a bank account with my mom. That's why I plan on getting my driver's license the day I turn 18. Once I've got that, I'm going to open my own bank account. **my own fucking bank account.** It'll be all mine, and Tabitha won't be able to stick her big fucking nose into any of it. I don't think I'm really going to sleep tonight. I'm going to stay up and think more about the plans for my birthday. 

Fuck Tabitha. Fuck her.

Fuck her for everything she's put me through. I'm going to drive through town with the windows down and the music loud. Blaring. Songs that I never could have played with her in the car. Not because they're profane, no. Because they're special to me. Because I can't play music that I like in the car. Because she talks the whole time about how shitty she thinks my music is. 

Fuck her.

I'm finally going to understand what everyone's talking about. How driving is such a freeing experience. I'm going to get in the car and scream, rip my vocal chords in two. I'm going to drive down a back road and scream everything out that I've been holding in for the past 18 years, and I'm just going to drive and drive and drive until I have to stop at a gas station I've never seen before to fill up my tank with birthday money. I won't be able to keep a smile off my lips. Picturing it now, I can see and feel everything so vividly. It will be dark out, and the sky will be full of those tiny little sparkling lights that I used to stare up at for so long. I'll feel closer to them, closer to that song of freedom that they always sang out to me. I know as I stand to fill up my tank, that the scent of gas will never have smelled so perfectly good before. Overcome with elation, I'll have to fight to not just jump up and down with joy. The lights of the gas station will stand out perfectly in the dark, with it's flashing ""open"" sign and it's cigarette and lottery advertisements. Maybe I'll spend a little more birthday money on a scratch off ticket, just because I can. That'll be one of the best feelings. Hell, maybe I'll go out and smoke a cigarette and have a drink on that hilltop. Yeah, I think I will. And I'll go to (a restaurant that allows smoking) with my friends so that when I come home smelling like ciggies, I'll have an excuse. Hell, maybe I'll even take (one of my friends) to that hill with me, and we can smoke and drink and sing the song of freedom along with the stars for the first night of the rest of my life. And from then on, I'll refuse to stop singing that song. 

Ever."
"So, I finished taking a shower around 10 minutes ago. I was in my room when my sister told me to follow her to the shower/bathroom, and she was visibly mad. When I got there my sister pointed to a pair of shorts and a t-shirt on the ground, in the far corner of the room, and she asked me, ""What/Who's do you think that is?"" 

And I replied, ""Your clothes?""

And she replied, ""Yeah, why do you think it's there?""

And I replied, ""I don't know.""

And she replied, ""I was going to take a bath.""

Then she said, ""If you want me to take you into consideration, then you need to take me into consideration.""

The reason she said that was because around a week ago her and I talked, and I told her that when she's screaming *all the time* it creates a really bad environment for me to live in, and I wished she would take me into consideration.

Another thing is that it wasn't apparent that anyone was going to use the bathroom. The lights were off and the door was closed, so I assumed that nobody was going to use it anytime soon.

This is so annoying."
"I just got yelled at to the point where I had to leave the room in tears because I can’t stand up for myself. Because you decided to raise me in a hateful home, I can’t take it when someone yells at me.

And the fact I’m pregnant doesn’t help.

Mom, why can’t I do anything right...? My boyfriend asked me to order us some food and he wanted 9 tacos but I messed it up and only got him 6. He yelled at me and I ran bawling my eyes out... Why can’t I just stand up for myself? I feel so shitty rn.

Mom, I don’t have anyone to cry to. You never taught me how to make friends so I never did. I’m so alone. I’m pregnant and alone. I feel like I’m gonna be a terrible mom because I can’t even order tacos correctly...

He’s so mad at me. I’m upstairs still crying as I type this... and he’s still playing on the PlayStation. He yelled annoyed remarks at me as I ran away bawling...

Mom, you taught me that this is love but I just learned on my own it’s not. Why didn’t you teach me that mom? Why didn’t you warn me?

Mom, where are you right now?"
"Hey, I'll start with what I actually did today first again.

So it was another school day and it went like every other school day. Boring and depressing. I had to leave half way through the day to drive an hour to get my bottom braces put on. They changed their mind and left for another 8 weeks, instead they just tightened them and it hurts like heck again. :(
I tried persuading my mum that it hurt so bad that I needed tomorow of but that was to no avail. After I got home I wasted more of my life playing alone on my xbox scrolling reddit and watching youtube. 

All in all a sad pointless and bad day

So Isolation. I feel lonely that basically it. I've isolated myself from my friends and they have done the same to me kind off. I barely text anyone now and when I do it's for help with homework. And no one ever ever texts me. I havnt had a good deep long conversation with anyone in weeks and I can see myself putting up a fake image to everyone more and more. 

Ever since the girl told me she couldn't be with me I've just felt like poo. I keep thinking back to when we kissed and how good it felt. I really miss it, I want to do it again, I dont want to mess it up this time:( 

I have pictures of us hugging and every time I look at them I get really sad every time she posts anything I get really sad and so on. 

I know its just me being a teenager and all that but I just hope it doesn't take 6 months to get over like the last one. I hope I dont isolate myself to much either, but maybe I've already gone past the point of no return in that regard. 

It actually kills just the sudden switch from her regularly texting me to just one word replies. I felt so good about myself and now I feel like nothing :(

Thanks for reading, have a good day

-Matt"
"It’s not even February and I feel a difference in this year that can only be described as an intense sensation. The last few months of 2019 were the most depressed I’ve been. I had a boyfriend who I loved with all my heart and I couldn’t be with him in the way I wanted because of it. I don’t think I’ve ever acknowledged the fact that I have depression with any degree of seriousness. I thought I could fix myself until I very painfully realized I didn’t have the strength to...at least not alone.  I wished so badly to be swept away, to burst into stardust, or to simply stop feeling every emotion so intensely. Before February I got dumped, had to move, and then two days later my cat dies.  I can’t decided if I wanna laugh at my pain or cry until theres not a salted tear left in my body. I wish everyday I used my voice and expressed myself with clarity those last few months of my relationship. Today I stared I new job across the street from my ex and I’m always aware but at the same time indifferent to it. I’m wondering if he’s eating and drinking water. It’s a lot that went into how we ended. I’ve stopped pitying myself and accepted the situation. I just hope he is ok but I know the best things for me is to let him go and get what I need done. Its extremely difficult not to want to call him or text him. I wish I could hold him just once more so he can feel how sorry I am. Sometimes I would look in his eyes and see our future. Now I’m looking at myself and I’ve always known who I am but when I’m in a relationship I lose myself in the other person. It’s taken me this relationship to realize this because it was real as real could get. Most of me knows this was meant to be but a lil part of me wants so very badly for him to call me and ask me to come back. I would take it as my opportunity to show how much I can do for myself for my relationship. Why hasn’t time travel been invented yet??? It regretful but a learning opportunity that I will take into my future relationships. I know my energy and how I can change things on my own. For the next person I’m with I make this promise to you...I will be ready to give you me and my all natural delicate imperfections. I will show them I’m here with them and always will be! You will have your person to count on in me and feel safe to speak your mind no matter what’s on it! I will listen to your dreams, rants, and random thoughts. I will be absolutely undoubtably yours to grow with. That’s all I gotta say...now I’m going to go play Minecraft to destress😌"
"I can fully admit that i'm probably the most boring man that anyone has met, trust me i've tried making companions and friends but maybe it's the lack of trust of myself that i cant seem to let them ""stick around"" (i know it's my fault.) I can only make friends of my hallucinations which are: Timothy who is a WW1 British soldier. He constantly gives me comfort whenever i get to see him, we talk about my own problems and he's there to keep me from harming myself but sadly i don't always see him but when i do it's such an amazing experience. Goes for the other random hallucinations i see they don't give me much but blank stares and some audio which i cant make out due to them literally whispering extremely fast. I crave for some trust in myself and the few people in my life, i don't know what happened to me. i don't understand when i became this way, i wasn't like this in the beginning of last year. what happened to me? i don't remember a trigger or a ""mental breakdown"" that made me start seeing these or hearing them or touching, smelling, sensing them, i miss my old self i miss when i had an actual grip on reality and not just standing here desperate for a sign that i'm not ""crazy"" but those are very few nowadays. oh trust me i don't do drugs or drink or cause these hallucinations, i despise drugs and that sort of thing. i want to be myself WHY CANT I BE MYSELF AS I ONCE WAS? i don't get why i feel this way...please i don't understand.

i fortunately do have a best friend and who is my wonderful girlfriend, but i cant seem to be a good communicator or tell how i feel and i truly hate myself i fucking hate myself severely due to it. i'm working on it though i'm trying..i hope i can become better and not some crazy asshole who will rot alone for the rest of my pathetic little existence in this robot controlled room that i'm in prison of."
"For the past year I have been experiencing significant dental pain. It has just been getting worse and worse. I have had emotional breakdowns because the pain has been so severe. But now the problem teeth are going to be pulled today, and I am terrified. The dentist will be putting me under IV sedation, so I will be most unconscious throughout the procedure and should hopefully not remember anything. But I am still absolutely terrified. I really do not look forward to the recovering process...

EDIT: it went well. Now, to heal."
"For a few seconds last night, I was hit by a sense of futility. I wondered if that's how depression starts, but then I remembered that I haven't exerted myself in any real way for a few weeks because of the surgery. I was sick of being stuck in bed. Sure I could work out the half of my body that isn't affected, but I don't want to risk hurting myself. I'd rather be patient and get better.

I was lucky she called when she did. I really needed a friend to talk to. We spent a couple of hours on the phone. I asked if she wanted to hang out in February she said she's free sometime mid February. I said which day exactly, she laughed. We both know we're not supposed to spend the 14th together. We both remember that horrible night when I had to explain to her why we were a bad idea. I don't think she believes me. I just don't want leading her on to be another thing on my conscience.

She sent me a photo of a male friend sitting across from her in a cafe we used to go to the other day, a med student I think. I wasn't jealous, partly because I have an unhealthily large ego, and I fail to see how a person like that can possibly compete with me. Life put me ahead of him for sure, not my effort, but I also cannot be jealous of someone I would or should intimidate. But I am not  jealous mostly because I don't worry about losing her.

I took a nap so I can be ready for my flight. I thought I can get around but after getting to my meeting and sitting down I really didn't want to get up, the pain was mild but it just tells me that I did too much. I really didn't have to come here, but I just wanted to leave my house. One knows one has a problem when one gets through 6 seasons of Game of thrones in less than 10 days. Sure I got a couple of things done, but not nearly enough. 

I got to my room and sent a few emails and  now I'm trying to stay away from the news. The market is picking up but that hardly means anything now. It can go south at light speed with a tweet."
"  “No one can ever know.” she breathed. 

She was small, blonde, wearing white capris and a black button up top. Mostly adorable. Her teeth had funny, too white marks on them, but who am I to judge? My smoking has left my teeth yellowing. 

I kissed her again, just as deep, just as needy. I could tell it was what her insecure brain needed. She introduced me all night as “the woman who danced with her husband”. I knew the second she titled me that, that she was insecure about me. 

Reality. I didn’t know he was her husband. I didn’t even know he was married. I just like to two-step. He is good at it. He asked me, I said yes. 

She assured me many times tonight she didn’t care; code for how much she really cared. She is gorgeous; she shouldn’t be so insecure. So I wanted to fix it. I hyped her up. I told her how hot she is. I complimented the way she danced, I danced with her, spun her. And in the bathroom, I pulled her close and I kissed her. I kissed her the way she needed to be kissed. Deep and wanting. Hand on the back of the neck, slow and deep. 

“No one can ever know” she breathed. 

“I’ll never tell,” I said as I pulled her back in. 

There is something about kissing another woman for me. It makes me feel powerful. It makes me feel… powerful. I don’t have a better descriptive term. Women have the ability to make you feel wanted like a man can’t. They are soft, they melt into you, especially if you hold them right. 

\----------------------

“I’ve seen your dick,” I said after he got finished spinning me. 

He was short, red-haired. He reminded me of an Irish leprechaun. He was a good dancer. The kind of man that knows what he is doing on the floor and makes a woman feel confident. 

I had danced with him months ago. He spun me around the floor then the same way he did tonight. Fluid. Arousing. Intoxicating.

As I was spinning with him tonight I looked down at his feet and I recognized the unmistakable pigeon-toed jig. I remembered dancing with him before. Giving him my number, five messages in he sent me a pic of his dick that I didn’t ask for. I blocked him. 

Here he was. Spinning me again. His little jig the only thing I remembered about him. 

“I’ve seen your dick.”

He smiled into the air at being caught and nodded. He finished up literally one of the best dances I have ever had and a booty-shaking song came on as he spun me for the last time. 

“I don’t dance to this kind of music,” he said above the noise. 

“Neither do I,” I said. We went back to our own groups. He left quietly moments later after whispering “Thank you.” Into my ear. 

“Whew! This girl!” Brenna said as she walked up with shots pointing at me. 

Brenna is the shot girl. Liss hated her initially. I’m not a follower by any means, but if my best friend hates someone, on precedent, I just don’t associate. It was months ago Liss told me she hated her. We are regulars and Brenna was new then. She kept floating around us, kept chatting us up whether we bought from her or not. Liss hated her less and less. 

On NYE I was standing alone. The countdown started and I was alone. It wasn’t a big deal. I have rung in pretty much every new year in my adult life alone (with my kids, but from an adult standpoint, alone). 

“Ten, nine, eight, seven!” The countdown started. I looked around, the bar I have grown to love was crowded, but even still, I was alone. “Six, five, four!” I resigned myself to no new year’s eve kiss. It was ok, I wasn’t even upset. I was grateful to be out, to be experiencing new years with adults. “Three, Two!”

Brenna appeared. 

“ONE!” She looked at me and shrugged. I pulled her in and kissed her hard. She kissed back just as hard. New year’s kiss with my shot girl. Not bad, I thought to myself. 

“Whew! This girl!” Brenna said as she talked to Liss about the kiss we had shared. It wasn’t the fireworks I had remembered. And tonight that NYE connection cost me an hour outside on the patio, in 30-degree weather listening to her tell me about her dope problem. Not worth it. But still a kiss many wish they could have.

“Sup,” I said. 

I was standing in the bathroom waiting on Liss and Emily walked in. Jesus, she is fucking gorgeous. She’s messy and natural. Her ass is just… too much for me. She’s fucking beautiful. 

I found myself making out with her as the bar shut down one night this summer. Her boyfriend stood by and waited patiently. I haven’t stopped wanting her since the first time I saw her. She’s snotty. I hate that about people. But with her, I get over it. Cause fuck. I want her. 

She walked into the bathroom tonight. Gave me a look. 

“Sup.” Was all I could say. 

“Going pee” she replied. But damn, the look she delivered with it…

“Did I misread what I saw in there?” I asked Liss once we had escaped the bathroom. 

“Not at all” Liss replied with a knowing laugh. Confirmation I wasn’t crazy. 

Emily left early tonight, as she walked by she pulled me tight, kissed my forehead many times and pecked me on the lips once before leaving with her man. She is a dominant female role. Like me. She likes the power she feels in having a woman want her. I don’t mind. She’s the only woman I would let dominate me. 

Silence. That’s what Shawn is. He doesn’t say much. He appears quietly. He listens. He kisses me softly. He listens some more. He seems to relate, be understanding, etc etc. But he says nothing. Not that I need words to remember him. But… he’s the one I’m actually interested in. Amongst all the superficial kissing, Shawn is the one that holds my attention the most. 

He wasn’t there tonight. I found myself missing his presence. On NYE, after Brenna, he appeared, mere moments after the countdown had ended. I remember feeling relieved. Not only because I didn’t want it to be Brenna I rang in the new year with, but because I had hoped it would be him. 

I have discovered I am the make-out queen of this bar. Maybe I am not the only one. But I have a slutty mouth. Perhaps it’s because I refuse to go all the way and have sex with anyone. Perhaps it’s because kissing makes me feel wanted. Regardless. I am a mouth slut. 

I struggled with that this week. I struggled hard. I don’t want to be any sort of slut at all. I fear that label. Here I am, though. 

Tonight I came to terms with it. It’s ok. 

It’s ok to want to be wanted. 

It’s ok to not be sure if I want a man or a woman. 

It’s ok to enjoy physical touch. 

It is ok. No matter what. 

\*deep breath\*

I have lived through some shit. 

I’m recovering. 

I am discovering. 

It is ok."
"So new year, new decade, first day at work (of 2020) was decent. Good vibes. Did some pending work. Real deal will start once my client comes from leave.

The girl who sits in front of me finally started noticing me. We shared some eye contacts finally. She is cute. Seems my type of person. Never spoke to her. Good thing is, we have the same religion which is a big deal when it comes to relationships in my country. So if things start getting serious, we may marry. Well that's far- stretched imagination. Idk why i always imagine 5 yrs ahead whenever i start liking someone. I need to do control my emotions. I don't like someone easily but when i do, i do it too much. Reason for so many heart breaks. But i have no idea how do i initiate things with her.

I have my exams in feb. Khan academy is a savior. It is helping me understand concepts in a way no one taught me while in college. 

So many conflicting goals at the same time. I want to learn to drive a car. I want to pursue masters. I dream of getting a job in google. But Google office is in a different city. I don't want to relocate and leave my parents. I don't know how i will become a good son. It's finally the time when i give my parents those luxuries which they abstained from. I feel bad. Really bad.

At the same time i want to find a gf. I want to get out of this mental torture of never having a gf and still not successful in my career. What was the point of all this effort if I haven't acheived what i want to achieve. Everything in life seems grey except success. Success is fucking binary. 1 or 0. You are either successful or a failure. You either get an admit from an Ivy league level college or you dont. No matter how close u were to your success, if u don't make it, there is no difference between you and someone who never tried. Take example of any sport, say cricket. You need to score 4 runs in 1 ball. You score 2 runs. You lose. It doesn't matter how close u were. World is fucking ruthless. It's funny how i started this post on such a positive note but as I started writing, the cry baby in me came out. 

I hope one day I write something about my success.
In case someone reads this, any suggestion regarding the ""conflicting goals"" part will be very helpful

Good night!"
"I feel weird. 

Where do I begin. Let’s start with the rose gold lenses. Now, I’m not sure if they’ve been on my face, or maybe they’ve just graduated to contact lenses. Because damn... have things been good. Normal. Other than Luis being here, it’s felt like what it’s supposed to feel like. Until he dropped that bomb on me. I was complaining about Luis and he says to me, “well you won’t be here for that much longer anyway”. And came the tears. 

I had basically forgotten that I was only here temporarily or so we “agreed upon” as he put it. In my head, I thought things went back to normal. We hadn’t fought. There’s food here. He gets to see his kids. Bam, things are perfect!

I haven’t said anything else about it since then. But I guess I do have to leave. My plan is to catch him when he’s high to announce my grand depressing departure. He has normal human feelings when he’s high. 

That will be the 5th of January. 

One thing that has noticeably changed is his need to be on social media. The main reason why I was so upset about it was bc he uploaded a new picture and 3 random hoes left these emojis; 🥰🔥💕...... those are bae emojis. Wow what are we fucking cavemen? Using little pictures to explain our important feelings. Man social media is so stupid. I hope I can look back and laugh at myself for being so upset over this. But he unfollowed me. And removed me from his followings. That was a slap in the face. So I blocked him. It was stagnant for a while, and then one day he hopped back on. It makes me wonder, am I not paying attention to him enough? Does he feel like he needs external attention? If so, I mean... am I supposed to even be filling that void? Since I’m leaving? I’m not his girlfriend right????

ThT brings me to my main reason for writing today. Last night I came to a huge realization. 

The entire day I felt tears building up behind my eyeballs, waiting to come out. Just waiting. Like they were attached to a sling shot or some shit. So I laid down, with my Santisma statue and stared at her in the eyes. And BOOM. everything came out. 

It was one of those cries where you have to catch your breath, the kind of cry where you wimper and cuddle up into a small ball questioning your existence. I did it in silence... I didn’t want Bear to hear me. That scene was very common. Bear lying behind me in bed while I cried my eyes out. 

Anyway

I’m picking up on the fact that it’s all very one sided. I mean yeah I knew that, but this time it felt more literal. Like, oh shit, it’s actually me I’m talking about not some 3rd person character. It made me wonder, if I didn’t talk to Him, or if I didn’t come and lay down with him in the morning, or if I didn’t text him first, or plan fucking dates, would any of it even happen..?

I don’t think so. Harsh as fuck. 

It really wouldn’t. So what am I doing? Have I asked myself this before? Is this just one of those bad days where I’m deleting everything good that’s ever happened just to soak in the never ending doom I’ve painted in front of me? I do that a lot. 

I woke up mad at him this morning. I actually told myself I’m a changed woman. I didn’t want to sleep with him this morning. Although I did come downstairs 

Oh yeah that’s another thing, he won’t sleep with us. 

Anyway, I got myself dressed and eventually he came up and started talking to me, but I didn’t initiate it this morning. Not that I’m proud, but I just didn’t want to- I mean that in the most humble way possible. 

I’ve been having dreams that he’s pursuing someone else. It might be true. 

Have you ever loved somebody so much it makes you cry. Yeah. I do. 

I keep saying to myself, why doesn’t he want what I want. Why can’t we be happy. I only want 3 things in this life. 

Love 
Commitment 
Stability 

That’s it. If I were to guess the 3 things he wants, I’d say it’s freedom, money and stds. 

I don’t want to say I’m giving up. But I can’t keep chasing him. I feel idiotic. I look like a dog following him around. Doing anything he wants, even things he doesn’t ask me to do. I’m kissing his ass. How do I get him to kiss mine? It’s like he’s never content with me. I don’t understand this chapter."

"Dear Diary

So I generally don't do continuations of previous entries, but here I am.  

Finally had a therapy session.  NS had cancelled the last session, and I cancelled the previous one before that.  Plus appts had been spotty since, oh, September.  

I actually brought up that I thought I was faking depression.  NS, to their credit, didn't agree or disagree.  They did ask what I was gaining out of faking depression. I was offended at first, but I think they were just playing devil's advocate.  At least that's how I choose to interpret it after reflection.

I have strong reasons for faking it.  All of them having to do with wanting attention.  My first instinct is to put others in my family before me.  Yet at the same time I can be selfish when doing little things.  No, that's not right.  I do have a selfish streak, and I do work hard to contain it.  But there are times when I let it out.

I can't help but wonder if I'm exasperating my depression, making it worse.  I feel trapped, trapped between two worlds.  I try to please both and fail. I wonder if I offered to leave either world if they would both gladly let me go, since I'm disappointing each side. 

I know I'm failing, and I know I'm not doing fair by either side.  I think the depression is an expression of the fear of failure, or a reaction to not living up to my expectations.  

And because I must complicate things to an infinite level, I think of all of this as I draw the knife across my arms.  No, not in an attempt to take my life, but to just have one thing that I can control, one thing that is going to be what *I* want it to be.  Not changing a recipe so everyone will eat it.  Not picking a movie everyone will enjoy.  Not putting on a radio station everyone can listen to.  This is me.  I am doing this.  

I control whether or not the knife draws blood.  I decide if it cuts.  Me.

I had admitted this in therapy.  It was pretty hard for me to do.  Wearing long sleeves so the scars weren't obvious.  All the classic tropes associated with NSSI.  Oh, the cat did it.  No, it was a brief moment of weakness.  No, really, I'm okay. I was almost afraid that when I left the appt it wasn't going back to my day but to the hospital for observation.  But I think I'm okay.

And I really am...  Maybe.  Might be another lie.  But I like to think a little of the evil in my soul leaks out from those cuts. A sort of a reverse baptism if you will.  

I hold the knife I used to do this a lot.  And a lot of the time I choose not to cut myself.  

That's something, right?"
"I'm thinking bout quitting my job. im trying to do a good job but i cant focus. My mind keeps going blank. Then i look at others and see how easy this shit is for them. I don't have the heart to call my mom and tell her im going to quit. But im sitting there at work thinking to myself ""what the fuck am i doing here?"". I'm miserable. I spend a lot of time crying in my car,. I can't eat without throwing up. I can't sleep even when I feel so fucking exhausted. and when i do get some sleep i get wild nightmares. I'v been dropping to the ground lately. might be cause my blood sugar is low since im not eating anymore. I'm fucking exhausted. I go out looking like I'm homeless or an addict. We had an active shooter training thing at work yesterday. in the warning signs section i was disgusted with myself to see that i checked every box. i wish i didn't write peoples name on here. I don't want to remember my coworkers when I leave. Ill probably go back and scratch there names out. I'm thinking about saying fuck all this and moving to a new state. my mom tells me no matter where i go ill always be who I am, suggesting that she thinking im running from myself. but thats not it. i just need a new start or at least a break from this city. people here don't travel so they arnt used to people who are different from them. and human nature is to fear what they dont know. I think thats why i get so much shit from people here. i dont know what i would do if i moved out of state and its the same shit there. that would really fuck me up mentally. I don't know what to do. I don't believe anyone can help. I don't believe anyone wants to help me. I'm tired of feeling like this and i dont see myself getting better any time soon. I got a blowjob again and it didnt feel good. I came twice then kicked the fucker out my car. I don't enjoy sex, food or sleep. I think something is seriously wrong with me. I still have hatred for others and my temper is getting out of control. not that im trying to control my anger or anything. I'm lost right now. I don't know what to do. this is irritating."
"  **Story of a tear.**

I hear the chatter of the table a few feet away. It’s a group of friends joking together, not unusual at all. I wonder sometimes if I will ever find my place again, like they have. I used to have it. For what felt like forever, a span without time limits I felt like I belonged to something. Something just like what they have. A place I could call home. Not a place per say, but a group of people that I felt where my family, with them, I fit. I was a member of something that I belonged to that was as much mine as it was theirs and that made us whole and happy together. But we were promised more in our lives than we could have in that moment.

So, I moved on, as did my friends. Flights, schools, travel, jobs, cars, bills, fights, and it took us all to heights we’d never considered we’d reach, but also depths we’d never seen. I can’t speak for my friends but I, myself, experienced some of the most intense emotions and some of the most distant times in my life. All of it though, I would trade to be back where I belong. For now, I am alone. I feel nothing of grandeur; nothing of substance, just empty – alone.

The clock still counts though, the days still pass, and I still age. There’s no going back. What is there to look forward to? Should I look forward to something at all? I used to be happy where I was, and I didn’t have to plan out when to be happy or how to make myself happy. I still planned for myself, but my own happiness never inspired a single thought; I was naive. I never saw the end coming, but surely, it came.

So today I am here. Alone. There are people all around me, but not my people, not my home. I always tell myself I will find home again, but truthfully, I don’t know how to. I don’t know where to look or who to turn to. I’m scared of losing the few scraps of salvation I have, but certainly no home here. What now? Is it over?"
"New chapter of my life year 2019 the eve of a new decade. Soon I will be moving to a new home joining me for the ride is my beloved soulmate and companion S. With us will be D, S's close friend of many years and perhaps counter soulmate who can comfort and cheer S in ways that I do not instinctively possess however I do not resent this fact for it shows me a side of my girlfriend Unshackled from Fear of judgment or shame. I also feel that in many ways I've grown substantially closer to D over the last few weeks although we have known each other for several years.
      My place amongst my friends is beginning to elude me. The sheer amount of time that we've spent together often Blends together and lets me forget that they are the closest friends that I've had in my entire life. We met at the tail end of our childhood and the coattails of our Legacies, matter set adrift tasked to find a singular meaning. Truth be told I feel farther apart from them as time goes by. I sense we are all on individual Journeys at this time but new insight brought to me bye S, D, and a set of tarot cards has left me confused on how to view this. I frequently feel like I maybe the glue that holds a group together. Although problematic in my own ways I tend to remain the level-headed one. I don't know if this is something we all sort of have to go through right now or if my closest friends, like in so many times in my life, are to be reduced too casual acquaintances and the memories that lay me to sleep. Maybe I'm overreacting or jumping to conclusion but I have a creeping sense of dread when I think about this. Still I don't find that to be my dominant emotion these days.
       Lately just spending time with S and D has been completely Sublime. My relationship with them has grown much more intimate as we move towards sharing a home. I feel much closer to S, I feel us changing, becoming different people and it warms my soul because I never thought I could be in love with someone other then the S I met but this new woman she is turning into has me swooning. When things are hard I know she will support me and I have dedicated my soul to being someone she can rely on. Our sex is much more refined and exploratory as of late, sexual partners of many years have to play games with each others arousal and treat it with the same passion for growth as every other aspect in each other's life. We communicate much better as well, I can be honest with her but my feelings as of late have left me conflicted.
       I'm noticing myself grow feelings for D. I don't quite have anyone to talk to about this. I first knew D as someone my friend was seeing and then came to know her as my girlfriends best friend so we never had an opportunity for anything more than friendship although attraction was always there and we have good chemistry. I get excited when I know we'll be spending time together and I feel at ease but also with tension when I'm with her. I don't have any desire to leave S and I don't have any intention of pursuing D behind her back. I find myself fantasizing about the three of us being intimate together. I daydream that Sam admits to me she wants to have sex with D and I or in the spur of the moment after many drinks involved we are all start to make love. We would then both be free to explore a further relationship with D without fear of jealousy or judgement from the other, D would have 2 new sexual partners and close deep friends to share a home with in this strange Unwritten New World.
    I'm sure this is all at least 90% wishful thinking and horniness building around the prospect of living with two insanely gorgeous women. It's easy to get carried away with fantasies especially sexual ones and my fear is that the reality is if I brought this up with S she could quite possibly get jealous scratch that she would almost definitely be jealous and it would make this living situation impossible for her. Then even if S was okay with the idea, who knows if D would even want something like that. If this entry seems in despair it isn't. I don't think this desire is something that I cannot control. I know that S is more than enough to keep me satisfied for the rest of my life but I cannot help being aroused at the premise. I sincerely will commit myself to not hurting anyone emotionally physically or otherwise. Anyway this was therapeutic for me still kind of in a gray area hoping the Stars will align, I hope there is forgiveness for a Lusty boy."
"I had to work today as part of a rotating shift. I don't mind working a rotating shift on Saturdays, and I don't exactly have a choice in the matter because, well, it's part of my job description. Also, it's much more quiet in the lab on the weekends, obviously.

You want to know what's not so quiet on Saturday nights? Public transit. Drunk people everywhere. I don't mind drunken folks as long as they're happy and not causing any trouble. If they don't bother me directly, I won't say anything. Tonight I got stuck with three drunks on the bus ride home. I honestly was expecting more to be on the subway, but no, it was on this particular bus route. I'll skip out all the details, but they were testing the bus driver's patience. One of them almost had the bright idea to toss a bag at the driver before his friend told him otherwise.

I've had my plenty share of drunks: most of them okay, others...not so okay. But, you know, that's one of the reasons why we have public transit, because we don't want these people to be driving. So, in the end, it all comes together nicely. Unless there's a fight. Or stabbing. Or shooting. Or all of the above.

I'm going to enjoy the last 60 seconds of this Saturday, and with that, we're almost there to Halloween! I don't want this spooky October to end so soon, but all good things must come to an end.

Goodnight."
"I’ve never written my thoughts out before, but I’m in a pretty bad headspace lately and maybe it’ll help. What’s the worst that can happen I guess. 

For the past while I’ve been pretty depressed. Probably about 16 months at this point that it’s been bad, though in all honesty it’s closer to 7 years since I’ve been a happy healthy boi. Which is really sad considering I’m only 20.

The last little while has been rough for a couple of reasons. Last year university was crushing me, I failed or dropped most of my classes, didn’t get accepted into the major I wanted, and lost all but one of my friends and I don’t know why, that’s when things all went down hill. So I decided to take some time off to fix things and reevaluate, now I feel like I have no direction in life. Talked to a therapist but not for long enough and I don’t really have the means to continue that. I’ve talked to my parents about it and they’ve supported me, but I don’t think they really grasp how awful it’s been. My mum said something the other day that was probably unintentionally the worst thing she’s ever said to me. 

“maybe this is the way it is and you just have to live with it”. 

Which isn’t that bad honestly, but then I’ve kinda neglected to tell them about the whole suicidal part. 

It’s always been a little voice in the back of my mind, with passing thoughts of it every now and then, kinda always thought that was normal, guess not. Lately however I spend a large part of my time thinking about it and it’s actually becoming concerning. I don’t know why I’m thinking about it, I just want to just not be alive more than ever before. 

I don’t want to feel like this anymore, but I don’t know how. So I’m really hoping writing this all out will help in some way. 

I also want to talk about my friend, but this entry feels like such a mess I think I’ll dedicate a separate one to her."
"I’ve done it again. I let him in. I let myself feel for him. Again. I know better. I have known better for a while. I though he was different. I thought he had grown. I thought he was open to change. For a while he was. He was pretending, of course. I forget that he can do that. 

After nearly two months he forgot himself. He forgot he was pretending. He forgot that I he doesn’t actually live here. He forgot that I would still hold him accountable. When it all came apart he was the same as he has always been. Cruel. There isn’t another word. Cruel with intention. Words sent with the intention to crush my spirit. I held up for days. I with stood it. I thought he would settle back down. I thought it was just a little regression and that he would eventually come and say he was sorry. 

I was wrong. Last night he spent 3 hours verbally abusing me. I learned what a huge piece of shit I am. I learned how uncaring and unfeeling I am. I learned that it’s all my fault. I learned that my leaving him is worse than the more than a decade of abuse he put me through. 

I know better, obviously. It still left me wanting to die today. I invested, again. I have waited. I have loved from afar. I have been at war in prayer. I have been true… and still. This is the result. 

The second things stop going his way he is giving up. The second there is rocky waters ahead he jumps ship and leaves me to ride the wreckage alone. I am devastated. I honestly don’t know why. I know this pattern well. There have been no surprises. 

I do know why. Because I know I deserve better. The only person I want it from is him. I feel like I deserve it from him. I know I am worthy. It wrecks me. How can he not truly love me? How can he so intentionally wreck me? 

I can’t fucking breathe. 

I want to die. 

It’s temporary. I know now that it won’t last. Soon my breath will come back. Soon the thoughts of death to escape the pain will vanish. My coping skills are better. I got help. I learned. I grew. I come back now. I don’t lie in waste for months anymore. 

It’s just the days after. It’s the next morning when he is sober and still no apology comes. It’s the lack of empathy. It’s the lies he tells me about love and his actions that tell of hate. It’s the whiplash. It’s a lack of understanding. 

I want to die. I. want. To die. 

I don’t know how to make the cycle stop. I don’t know how to turn him away forever. I fucking love him. I never stopped. Through it all, I never stopped. Even after counselling when I found out how abusive he is, even after I found out what real love looked like. After everything, I never stopped loving him. 

He refutes that. Boldly, loudly, vehemently. He is sure I don’t care for him. My heart weeps. He doesn’t know what love is. To him love is sex. Love is conformation. Love is obsession. I can’t be that. I can’t ever be that again. I don’t want to. I want to be better. I want to stay better. I am. I am doing it. 

It feels like death. The loss is so great. Sometimes it is almost unbearable. I have never lived through a thing that has so repeatedly crushed me. I have never loved a thing so bad for me. I have never shed so many tears as I have shed over him and for him.  

I just want to die. I can’t stop weeping. I can’t breathe. I can’t. 

The weight of life sits on my chest. The reality of how alone I am continually rears its ugly head and makes itself known. The pressure of work is crushing. Raising three boys with no father is a challenge. I have risen to it, and I am nearly to the end. Over half way there, but, with each passing day I feel myself becoming less available. School overwhelms me weekly. I work hard. I am doing it. I am succeeding. I am just so weary. I am so broken in this moment that I don’t’ want to continue on. I don’t want to keep going. I just want to lie down. I want to rest. 

“Buck up buttercup” my brain says to me through my tears. You have been through worse. Life has been harder. You have overcome it all and survived. It’s true. My brain speaks truth. I know it in my very core. My brain doesn’t make it to my soul, though. The place deep within me where the pain lives. That place I keep locked up and put away. 

Nights like these it spills over. I let it out like this. Tapping away at a keyboard while my sad music plays. Dialoguing my way through it until I can actually see the words on the screen again. Tap, tap, tap, until finally my breath starts to come easier. 

Everything is ok. In the end it will all be ok."
"I've had so many exciting experiences since I have now moved to Toronto. It's so good to be back home. 

I love how multicultural and diverse Toronto is. That's one of my top favorite things about Toronto. 

So, I won't go day by day like ""yesterday did this, today did that"" because I can't exactly remember what thing happened on which day. 

So, let's see, I went to The Ex and Ontario Place with my sister. The Ex isn't going right now and Ontario Place no longer functions as a theme park but it's so lovely and peaceful though. It's great for going on a date or going for a walk or a jog. It's so peaceful and beautiful there. I got my picture taken in front of one of Toronto's oldest buildings, it was built in 1794 and it hasn't moved, or been rebuilt since. Also got my picture taken in front of Lake Ontario which is a pretty lake, I think it's pretty. 

I went to Dufferin Mall with my sister and a friend. It's a really nice mall, lot's of great stores. Got a few needed things there. I had poutine there for the first time in years and it tasted wonderful, I have missed having poutine a lot. Also, my sister and friend took me into this very wild store that has all kinds of weird things in it and in the back it sold sex toys. I've never been in a store that sold sex toys before, so that was interesting. 

Went to Kensington Market with my sister and a friend. What a great market, again all kinds of neat things there. Heard accordion music but have no idea where it was coming from. Went into a place called The Blue Banana and there is more cool stuff in there. Walked through China town and went into a couple of shops and looked around, it's a great spot for tourists cause of the cute knickknacks. 

Went into downtown Toronto to Yonge and Dundas Square and it's basically Canada's version of New York Times Square. Lots of billboards up everywhere, people playin music everywhere, and there's regular tourist buses that stop there. If one ever was bored and needed something to do, they should go there and there is lot's to do so long as they money. 

Walked down to Harbourfront which was pleasant, not as busy as the square, it's a nice area though. 

I'm sure there's lots I'm forgetting to mention as I've experienced so much here. I should start a vlog of all my adventures in my new home. 

I'm not used to seeing so many homeless people. It's so sad, and I wish I could help them all but there's just too many of them. I'm also not used to smelling urine and body order all the time, it's smelly in the city. 

I'm also not used to all the noise yet, I'm hoping to adjust soon. 

I guess it's harder for me because for 16 years I've been living in a little town in California that only had three streets. It was always so quiet you could hear a pin drop and you could go out and not see one person or one car go by for a good hour or so. I'm not complaining, I love my new home, it's just gonna take time for me to adapt to it. 

I'm still not used to the hustle and bustle though and I got my seasonal affective disorder which should be making it's appearance pretty soon as the seasons will start changing here soon and the seasons here do change unlike California which is 9 months of summer and two weeks of bad sledding. I'm not used to what is about to come to Toronto which is fall and winter. I'll be seeing snow, which I haven't seen in 16 years. 

Being Autistic doesn't make the adjustment any easier for me either. There's so many new sounds and smells. I do love it here, it's just a lot to get used to. Tomorrow though my sister and I agreed to have a do nothing day, which I feel I need. I feel like I need the day tomorrow to just stay home and chill and read a good book. That sounds really good to me."
"I don't usually journal, but i needed to get these thoughts out of my head and on paper. If you could provide insight or critiques, they would be most appreciated. Thank you.

September 16, 2019

I am starting a journal entry for the first time in a very long time. Today’s events have been long, confusing, over joyous, and taxing. It has kept me up far past when I intended to sleep just running through different parts of the day over and over. I need to get it out of my head, and this format seems to be the best way for that to happen. I woke today at 6:30 a.m. with the intentions of going to church. I grabbed my clothes, took my medicine, and headed upstairs to take a shower. However, there were no towels upstairs as I thought. Because of this I opted not to take a shower, and indeed skip church altogether. My father pointed this out and laughed at me. I don’t know how he is so perceptive, but I wish I could just hide my intentions from him as I do others. I attempted to hide this truth with word trickery, but again he was too smart for that. I am now confronted with the thought that if he can see through that, then surely, he has had my other thoughts. I know he must feel as I do when look at myself through his perspective. He is too smart not to. Or perhaps smart isn’t the word I am looking for. Perhaps I mean to say he is too worldly to not have thought that. Mother would have dismissed such thoughts at once, but not father.

After he left, I talked to mother for a while, perhaps an hour or two. I can’t remember what was discussed, but I do remember that it was a warmly conversation. Afterwards I left to go prep for class. My group had arranged to meet at the library later and I wanted to prepare some work before I got there. I checked my email and had noticed that the group presentation project I had done was graded. I looked it over and felt it fair. I received an 87. an irritating number to be sure, but I can live with it. On an individual criterion grade, they all felt fair or even over the top. However, he did give me a zero for handling questions. I’m not sure why but I don’t have the drive to find out either. All seemed business as usually until I had reached the comments portion. I found this peculiar since they were actual comments there. Usually its filled with drivel, “Not bad”, “Needs to speak more clearly”, or even “It was ok”. But this time actual remarks were left. As I began to parse them, I noted that some of the drivel had indeed been here, but in the center of all was something different. “Horn has come an incredibly long way with presenting and I'm honestly really proud of him for speaking so clearly and confidently today!” I was shocked. This had been, perhaps, the kindest word I have heard all month. I choked and was unable to continue reading. I am glad I was hidden in my little apartment area, because I must have looked like a fool. I nearly cried reading that. I can’t imagine who might have wrote that. The thought stayed with me even after I left and went to school.

I arrived at the library at the specified time and illegally parked my car in the meter area. As I was getting out the ticket man arrived and was already ticketing expired meters. I’m unsure why my immediate reaction was to grab a handful of quarters for the meters; but as I approached him, I started to feed everyone’s meters. When I reached him, I offered him a quarter in exchange for not giving the person parked there a ticket. He reluctantly obliged and I fed the meter and left. I had also done another thing strange. I had fed my own meter when I knew very well, I was going to be ticketed regardless. I immediately began chastising myself. Such a foolish thing to do, I might have spared another person a ticket.

I then reached the meeting room and waited for the rest of the group arrive. Ethan was the first to arrive. His enthusiasm for his database idea was remarkable. I had a smile all while he went at length about how much time he spent on this rough draft and drew it out on the board. After much discussion he asked the important question, where was everyone else. It had been at least 15 minutes after the time set that someone else finally showed. He was got there, and more work was done and then the last two trickled in. after 15 more minutes all work ended abruptly, even though we hadn’t accomplished everything we were trying to get done in that session. They scheduled another sprint planning meeting for Wednesday. What a mess.

After we got to class, we sat and listened to two presentations. I usually like other people’s presentations, but I was disinterested this time around. Perhaps it was the subject matter, perhaps it was the lackluster meeting, or perhaps it was simply Monday. Regardless, I gave them all full scores and left no notes. Reflecting on the note that had been the highlight of my day, I thought to write a comment like that of my own. I even inked that paper where I intended to put my thoughts but couldn’t bare too. I simply sent it along its merry way and grumpily sat back in my seat. I listen to the lecture and took notes and left class. I wondered if I should have texted Richard. I was supposed to meet him today, but the meeting got scheduled over his club thing. Honestly, I have nothing but contempt for the clubs. But I must keep reminding myself to make an effort.

I elected not to text him and instead sat on the top floor area and work on my computer. I was struck with an idea that is too premature for even this ill-defined format. Work began and I spent the next couple of hours at work on it. Talked to some of the students as they passed by. I meet one of the members of the group again and we talked for a spell. I don’t remember what we talked about. Conversations usually are nothing more than performance art. And non the less, I still find myself enjoying them. I like the small talk. The unimportant and the high concept alike. I find myself carelessly shifting from one too the other. Unfortunately, this leads me to say too much. I ended up telling him that I was fasting for the pasted three days. And, while true, that is a totally stupid thing to say. I must learn to reign myself in more.

As I was getting ready leave, I ran into one of my professors. We talked for a minute and started for the class room. We both ended up there at the exact same time and met with the other students waiting for the class to begin. He mentioned something about hating his own voice, and that sparked the thought of why that was. I could not help but inform him, though with more tact than I’m usually capable of. He seemed to care about that useless info because he proceeded to expand upon it. The lecture room emptied, and the new students entered followed by the professor. He then proceeded to give the driest lecture I may have ever seen.

Except for one part, where he was using a journalist website as an example and a pair of breasts were on the front page. Oddly I was disturbed by this. The thought to calm down entered my head. This is what one sees when they are a college student, I told myself. For some reason I felt it necessary to soothe me over a topless woman. She wasn’t at all disgusting, in fact quite the opposite. I am still at a loss for why I felt unease about the whole ordeal.

The professor began and as soon as he started, he raced back to the console to exit the page. The entire class room erupted with laughter, yet I sat quiet. Even a month ago I would have been laughing with the rest of them. Yet today I sat embarrassed and ashamed. The professor made his apology and the class jeered. After the commotion had died down the lecture continued and concluded.

He gave the class a break before moving on to the next portion of the lecture. During this time a girl had come over and greeted me. She was from the partner team to my own. She asked if I was me and if I was the SCRUM Master. After verifying my identity, she began expressing concern about her team and project. She asked what portion their team was supposed to be working on. This surprised me greatly as the project should already have gotten underway. I explained to her what her team oversaw and walked through process quickly to set her on the right track. I informed her, that she really should meet with her own SCRUM Master and explain her concerns. But I know her SCRUM Master, and it will be a miracle from God alone if any work finds itself complete.

I had previously noticed her before, but I had not taken a close inspection. I used this opportunity to scan her face. She wasn’t conventionally attractive, yet she was far more beautiful than most women I see. Her eyes were too large, her nose too point, her face too narrow. Yet, it all fit perfectly. It was like the fashioning of miss matched jigsaws to create a new painting. Her presence simply radiated soft joy. I could not help but be enamored by her. But I’m sure she is already married.

How lowly. Lusting after a married woman, I am scoundrel. But it wasn’t exactly lust was it. No, I had no perverse intentions for her. No, It’s a warmer cleaner affection. Something that I had not felt for a long time, and something I resigned that I should not feel again. I know I must have made a fool of myself tripping over my words. I simply hope I did not scare or creep her out. One thing is for certain, I must limit my interactions with her.

We then began on the lab portion. The assignment was to make a persona based on the last project we did. I went and immediately found a persona making software online. I made a quick five-minute email and used it to gain access to the site. I filled it out and presented it. He was shocked that I was able to find something like that and asked me to forward him the link. I happily obliged while he was explaining that he intends to use that software in the lab from then on. He made a remark about how tired he was, and I agreed and once again brought up my fast.

I don’t know why I keep doing this. Do I want recognition for my fasting? I know it’s a lie. I am technically fasting, that much is true, but the means in which I am achieving that are dishonest. I am only able to do so because of my Adderall. Is it wrong of me to take pleasure in the fact I no long eat regularly? Do I want brag to everyone about this? Surely, this is shameful and something that must be hidden, and yet I keep pointing it out to people. What game am I playing? What do I intend to happen? I feel I have purposefully obfuscated these motives from my rational mind. At any second that dull loathsome creature is going to does something foolish and ruin the whole prospect. He should be happy that the weight is coming off, and that his grades are higher than ever. He doesn’t even have guilt as an excuse, as I purposefully went and got a prescription for it. I should not be doing this too myself. Does he resent me?

After carelessly bragging to the professor about my fast, he stopped and deliberately looked at me. He imparted that at the height of his obesity he weighed 400 lbs. and lost it all the exact same way I am doing it. He grimly stated that it nearly killed him, but that he brought it down to 180 lbs. in about a year. I feel as though this should have been a warning, but I did not receive it as such. I found salvation in that sentence. If he could do such a thing alone, could not I with my crutch. I just need to keep taking my medicine. I feel as though as this my not be an insurmountable obstacle as before, but that I can cheat my way to the top of it. I made my pleasantries and left for the day.

I tossed and turned in bed for hours. I paced my little alcove all the way through. I felt my medicine wear off and felt all my surprised emotions of the day bubble to the top and burst out of me. I cried for nearly a minute. I almost took another pill, just to stop the weaker of Is from taking over. But that would have been whole foolish. I cannot hide from him forever. Its best to just let him do his thing calm down afterwards. So long as he doesn’t sabotage me or eat to break my fast. I should fare alright."
"It's starting to get cold again. Not a lot, not yet, but slowly. The spring and summer have been long and warm. This time around I've noticed that. So I'm ready for the snow. It'll be cold for a bit too long, but the spring and summer will be long and warm.

I feel like the winter is just the right time to make a year's ending. It's a season where you bide your time. It's made significant by the negativity of a cold outdoors and a power bill spiked by indoor heating. It's when you start counting the days again. 

I get to thinking about how the years keep on passing. The season's cycling seems small and endlessly repeatable. It's not though. This might be a controversial opinion, but our way of life is ending. We've got climate change on the doorstep, and we're not going to change to greet it. If we make it out of that, then we've got nukes and whatever deadly toys we think up next. If all else fails, I'll die anyway. So these short cycles are all I get. That helps me put life in perspective. A few short seasons is all we get."
"I'm 24 years old, and I've never been good at singling out thoughts or emotions. I've never been good at getting myself together. So when someone would ask me how I'm feeling, my answer would always be pretty generic. ""I'm alright. I'm fine. Doing ok."" That kind of stuff. The last few months, I've magically gotten better at it a little. It's helped me figure out what I want to do with my life, where I want to go with my hobbies and helped me find new ones.

But it's also put some things into perspective for me.

I show heavy signs of being manic depressive.

I don't like self diagnosing, so I won't say that I straight up am. However, the older I get, the more I see how much like my mother I really am. When I was growing up, my dad would always say that she's sick. She needed medication. I wasn't old enough to understand what that meant. As my parents got divorced when I was 16, I spent more personal 1 on 1 time with her. I wanted to help her be ok with everything. She stopped taking her medication, and I was able to see how sick she was. I wasn't sure what she had. Schizophrenia? Depression? Bipolar Disorder? That was 7 years ago, and I didn't know much about anything. I'm older now. I know things.

I know that the way I act is much more like my mother than I thought before. The older I get, the worse my mood swings get. The older I get, the worse my depression gets. Each pit is deeper than the last. Every time, I'm worried that the pit I find myself in will finally be the one that I can't crawl out of. But I eventually do, for the time being. I didn't know what manic depression was until about a year ago. I heard about it, read the symptoms, thought it sounded a lot like my mom. I was able to put words to her illness. But also found similarities to mine. It scared me, quite frankly. I cried as I read the symptoms and the usual behavior that people with the disorder suffer from. Again, I don't say I have it. But if it quacks like a duck, so on and so forth.

It's not all bad though.

I'm lucky enough to have an incredible support system behind me. My wonderful girlfriend keeps me as grounded as she can. She also suffers from depression, so I attempt to do the same for her. We do our best to sidestep our own pits to help each other out of the pit the other finds themselves in. My parents, especially my mom, help as best as they can when they know I'm stuck.

I've always struggled with finding my calling until recently. I want to be a writer. After two decades of loving movies, video games, music, and comics, I've learned that I have a calling for it. Writing my own stories and building my own worlds is something that makes me feel so happy and joyful inside, even if it is fleeting at times.

I know this is long winded, and I apologize. This is my first time posting to this subreddit. I figured it would give me the chance to clear my head for once, get my feelings down on metaphorical paper, and just let it go. As sporadic as my train of thought may seem. Thank you for all of you who stuck with this post for as long as you did. I hope everyone who reads this, and those who don't, have a wonderful day. Stay strong everyone."
"I posted this in a different sub but it was removed. Sorry. If it goes somewhere else let me know.


My dog got into my rasinettes a couple days ago and ate a handful and I've been keeping an eye on him. I won't have some money to help him for a couple weeks and now he's vomiting. It just started last night but it's been about four days since he ate the candy.

It's clear, but smells like rot. And his gums are turning grey.

I've been told he's not going to die, that he'll be fine, and was given medicine to help him, but I'm still worried.

He's my mental health dog and it was my fault he got into my candy, so if something happens to him I don't know what I'll do.

I've been told it is highly likely to be dehydration. I went out to go to the hospital yesterday morning supposed to be for an hour or two, making sure he had water until I got back, but we had a blow out and I didn't get home until late. When we got home he was out of water and had started getting sick.

I was told to watch him for 72 hours and if he starts to have seizures then it's from the candy and I'll need to make plans on him dying.

Update; he stopped puking, has kept for down (baked chicken, no seasoning) and the color is coming back to his gums.

Update: (8/25/19); He's back to his old noisy self and I'm so happy. He was checked by a family friend who's a vet in another town and she said we were lucky; it wasn't from chocolate poisoning after all it was just dehydration; and it's guide own fault.

She said he's not drinking water on purpose, he just doesn't like water. So we gave him some melon, cantaloupe, and cucumber by her orders and he's all better now. We're looking into a way to get him to drink more water. He does, but it's not enough. She suggested we give him water rich fruits and vegetables whenever we see his gums start to turn grey, and gave us a list to go by that will give him the nutrients and hydration he needs.

This is the first time this has ever happened with one of my pets, but she said it's common for his breed. They decide randomly that they won't eat or drink something and it's Hell to get them to once they decided they're not going to. She's dealt with others like him and told us it's not our fault, it's probably a mineral in the water he got tired of tasting. She's suggested switching our bottled water to a different brand or just giving him tap, but the tap here isn't clean, we're still having to boil water after the pipe on our road burst. So it looks like my high maintenance dog will be getting fancy bottled water for the next couple weeks."
"I feel so miserable.

I absolutely hate where I work at, it brings me no joy whatsoever; it's this constant dead end of me not progressing of what I WANT to do in life. I feel so stuck doing the same old-same old routine, and I want to break free. Not only that, I have to deal with ""Karens,"" the worst type of humans out there.   


On top of that, I swear, I'm going to be single forever...which is probably the sad truth. I want to be with someone, to kiss, to hug, to cuddle, to even eat dinner together: I eat alone every day; I know this sounds so cheesy and stupid, but it'd be nice, but I feel like I'm being ghosted everyday.   


I can't date because I feel like no one gets the time and effort to ever get to know me which frustrates me. I just don't WANT TO GO on a date and the end, I actually want to know them before hand, but NOOOO that takes too much time for other people, smh. I swear, at this rate, I am going to be single forever.   
I want to get to know people, but they don't want to get to know me; I just hate not having physical affection, and being lonely.  


It sucks."
"I lost my relationship with my boyfriend 2 weeks ago. It's really hurt. But I somehow forget to think about him recently thanks to a bunch of things to worry about like my family, my future and so on. I keep watching fun videos late till I fall asleep to avoid negative thoughts, and keep my self busy the next day.

I've just thought I had magically made it. But then I unintentionally came across a blog post of him more than one year ago. In that blog, he talked about how happy we were at that time, and wondered how he could ever hurt me (tho he already did now).

I fell into emotional state for a while. But then I managed to pull myself together and went find something funny on Reddit. I found it and immediately send the video to one of my best friends who often exchange stupid memes with me. But he just showed a kinda ingorent attitude towards me. Actually recently he's been somewhat distant from me. Like, he used to text me every day, and then... Everything just goes terribly like that. I'm now becoming more and more bored when thinking of making a conversation with this friend. 

I may lose another valuable relationship again. That's sad.

My friend circle is already small for I being such an introverted person. Each relationship is really important to me because I pour very much love into them. 

But it's ok. I have to give up those things that don't want to belong with me anymore. It's better to let things go like that. I'm too tired to keep broken bridges not falling down.

Hope that everything will get better soon. Please."
"I'll say now; I'm not in love with you. Christ, I can't do that to myself or you. I'm not in love with you. 

But.

I see you, just for a moment in my periphery, and my heart leaps and aches. My chest is sore after a day with you; I think it's because my heart is pounding from the second you walk in until long after you leave. I'm pathetic. You don't see it but you don't see me holding Calamity itself, wishing you were near to me. I'm pathetic. I'm wrong. 

I always want to touch you. It takes everything not to reach out and touch, hold, kiss you. Yes, even at work. I always want you. I mean that emotionally, physically, spiritually? I don't believe in spirits but I know the feeling I have when I'm with you... is one I want to keep. I want you. You make me feel more human, more normal, less alone. I have people around me, yes. But I'm lonely. Not with you though. I don't feel alone with you. I feel like myself.

I want to die. I've made mistakes and hurt people. I'm not a good person. I'm conniving, manipulative, coercive. My body knows and is starving me out. I should die. I should be dead. I want to be dead. 

But.

I want to get you out, you're being smothered and it hurts that I can't take you. 
I can stay alive for you. I can smile for you. I want your smile. I want your happiness, no matter how fleeting. 
You're my friend and I want you."
"[real] I need to share my depressing diary

I've been keeping a diary of my ""relationship"" for quite a while. I just read through it and it's pretty depressing. I just wanted to share with someone for advice, or for laughs. Fair warning, It's really long.

I think about you a lot. 

I wish I could help with your job in 3A

You are so fucking cute. Sometimes I pull up your pictures and I just smile.

Your nervousness around me is unnecessary, but I feel flattered. It must mean that you care about what I think.

Will you ever leave him? 

When you complain about him it sounds like you are expecting it to work out. 

Even if we don't end up together, you don't need to be with that piece of shit. 

You are amazing and you deserve better.

You are so gorgeous, cute, sexy, just fun to be with.

I like when we touch, even just a slight touch when we're standing next to each other.

I like that you are artsy.

I like that you aren't religious.

I like that you are kinda nerdy.

I like your sense of humor.

I like your snaps.

I wish you were here.

I want to pick you up and take you home.

I want to kiss you.

I want to kiss your neck.

I want to taste you.

I want to go somewhere with you. 

I want to stay at home with you.

I want to watch Netflix with you.

I want to push your hair back over your ear.

I want to touch your back.

I want to pull you close.

You are my favorite person.

I want to play games with you.

I want to study with you.

I want to make you laugh.

I want to make you blush.

I want to make you quiver.

I want to share a holiday with you.

I want to go on vacation with you.

I want to take care of you.
I want to go to a museum with you.
I want to go to a comedy show with you.
I want to go to a movie with you
I want to go to bed with you 
I want to make love with you 
I want to wake up to you 
I want to stare into your eyes.
I want to feel your body pressed up against mine.
I want to touch your curves.
I want to feel your lips upon mine.

1/2/19
You said you were really glad to have met me. 😊

1/3/19
You asked me on a date!

1/6/19
You turned me down 😔

You pursued me but I was completely consumed with the thought of you. 

I know you are out of my league, but you are 1000x better than the shitbag you are with.

I can be civil and I want to be your friend, but fuck him. 

I must have misread our intimate conversations and pics.

I've been really depressed since you told me off. 

You hurt me 

1/24/19

You keep giving me mixed signals. You are so happy and flirty when we are in class. You love complaining about Daved around me. But you aren't willing to spend time with me.

Today I playfully pulled your hair. We went to lunch and I cannot describe how happy I was too have you in the front seat wearing my other sunglasses. I just enjoy being around you. I thought we would be near each other in the class picture, but that didn't work out. I'm sure I am overthinking every interaction we have, but that's how I function.



Today you invited me to lunch and we went to Applebee's. I was so happy to spend time with you but I felt so bad that you were so frustrated. I thought we flirted a little, but I wasn't sure. You smiled a lot. You seemed to have a good time with me though. Later in the day you invited me to the rebillet concert and it sounds like fun.

Today I tried to figure out what grade you would need to pass your last 2 finals. You called me sweet, which sounds totally ""friend zone"" but then you sent me the sexiest pic out of nowhere. You were on your back, in bed, one leg raised, hiding the treasure. Your back arched, that curve between the tattoos. It's hard to think you don't like me. But I still have no clue.

3/11 Last night you asked me why you only attract assholes. That kinda hurt, but you said that obviously didn't apply to me. I tried to comfort you and you said you needed a hug. I wanted to hold you close and make everything better. Then you asked me to lunch today after I sleep 😁. Well, I haven't really been able to sleep at all. You suggested I go to bed naked and have dirty dreams right before you sent me a pic with a super seductive look. I've had plenty of dirty thoughts, but I still can't sleep. Now I'm just waiting for you to tell me when you want to hang out. I hope we actually get to go this time.... And you can't go....

5/3/19
We went to the Marc Rebillet concert tonight and the concert was great, but being with you was best part. We hung out at my place for a bit beforehand and then went to steak n shake after. I was super nervous to even touch you at the concert.
We came back to my house and talked on the couch forever. We kept getting closer and closer together until you finally kissed me. I've wanted to do that for so long. I felt so warm inside when I felt your lips. We laid awkwardly together and I got to play with your hair and you held my hand just a bit. I know we could have gone further, but I think this was a perfect night.

5/4/19
Today was Mercy SDC day. I met you and Keely? Not sure on spelling... She's so much like you, it's hilarious. I gave her a giant cookie and I'm pretty sure I won her over with that. You two were so fun to be around. I tried to keep my hands off of you when I needed to, but I had to sneak a kiss while she was in grandfather's mansion. We've been talking late at night and you called me tonight too. Poor Keely got sick after you two got home and I really hope it wasn't my fault. I really like being near you.



5/6/19
You said you were a little obsessed with me ☺️ the feeling is mutual. 

5/8/19
You were too nervous to come into the bedroom. We eventually kissed im on the couch and we ended up in bed. You said you had just ""started"" but I still wanted to touch you. I really could kiss you for days..

5/12/19
I sent you cookies at work today. You seemed embarrassed and excited. 

I can talk to Ashlee about you!

5/13/19
We were going to go to lunch today but you showed up at my place and we talked and kissed for hours. Feeling you next to me is amazing. I love it when you lean into me. It was well worth putting off lunch.

Apparently I shouldn't have told you about this diary.

I just asked you if we were boyfriend/girlfriend and you said no. I'm broken. We talked about so many things. Spending weekends together. I thought maybe we were hinting at feelings for each other today. I'm so lost. My throat hurts.
I admitted that I might be in love with you and you admitted…. That you have feelings.
I'm not asking for a commitment, but we're more than just friends. I don't do this with everyone I talk to.
Tonight's words
I like you. A lot. I really do. But I don't think I can actually be in a relationship until things here are completely over. And they aren't. I don't know what's going to happen here. I've tried to talk to him but he shuts me out.
I never want you not in my life
These are always the words I hear before a breakup.

Apparently I'm important enough to you that you never want to lose me, but I'm not enough to be with you. But then in the same conversation you didn't say that you love me, but the word love came up several times. I think you do, but you’re scared. You even told me you want me to make love to you. I will. But you've never called it that before.

“you’re one of my favorite people on this planet. I really am thankful for you and your presence in my life. Thank you for being here, just to talk to when I need it “
That was my last breakup message. I hope you aren't doing the same.
You've seen me in my most stressful times. I've seen you in yours. We've always been supportive of each other. I could never yell at you. I would never intimidate you. I respect you and adore you too much. Ugh, IDK what to do.
I won't say it again, but I do have deep feelings for you.

I hate seeing you in so much pain

5/15/19
You seemed really down last night after you had found some really old love notes you had written to him. You wanted to come see me and that would have been amazing, but you had to work today. You said you needed a hug and it made my heart sink that I couldn't give you one. We keep talking about sleeping together, but I think last night would have been a good time to sleep, and cuddle together. 

I really wanted to stop by 3A today. I don't want to cause you any drama though. 


We just talked on the phone. It felt great, but it would have been better if you were here. I just want to hold you close, kiss your neck, and play with your hair

5/17/19
We talked for a bit and chatted for a while. It's 0115 and we just said goodnight and you have to work in the morning. I could talk to you all night. I really wish I could kiss you goodnight. 

You stopped by at 7 after you got off work to see me 😁 you said you couldn't leave without kissing me. We snuck down to the break room for a quick hug and kiss. You made my night. You later sent me a dirty story which was nice, but then you said you loved my face and that you really really care for me. You do have feelings for me 😁 I'm sorry if I scared you when I admitted my feelings but it's nice to know you have some feelings too. That was the best part of the night. I can't wait to see you again.


5/18/19
Well damn. It was nice seeing that little heart on Snapchat.
Tonight at work you sent me a couple of strip tease videos. One you unbuttoned your flannel to reveal your black bra, the other you were in bed and raised your t shirt before gliding your hand down your body. Then you slowly took off your panties. The whole time you were moving your hips sure to side. It was incredibly sexy. 

5/19/19
You woke me up with some snaps and messages. Best way to wake up. We talked about some of our sexual fantasies. 
5/20/19
I got off work at 7 am. I went and got you a hot mudslide coffee from Mercy mocha and I tried to find you on 3A. I peeked in every room as I went by but I didn't see you. As I walked by your nurses station, wow, I'm sure some were aides, but every seat was filled and there were so many people. I walked down the hall on the classroom side, back up the other hallway and I couldn't find you. I swear your name wasn’t on the board. I would have found you if it was. I left your coffee in your break room with your name on it. Luckily you found it and you thanked me for it. 

ItOkay, same day for you, different day for me. Night shift is torture. 
You stopped by to see me after your shift and you were super cute. I really want to spend time with you. We talked at the nurse’s station for a bit while Korby was on a computer nearby. I completely thought he would give us a hard time. But he didn't. We walked down the hall and shared a few kisses in the stairwell before you went home. I thought maybe then Korby would give me hell, but he didn't. When I mentioned you later to get a reaction out of him he just acted like he already knew and expected it. 
Are we that obvious? Ashlee, Tiffany, Korby... Does everyone know we're…I still don't know what you would call us. 
You also sent me a list of things you like about me. You have no idea how happy that made me. I love knowing that you think about me and I love knowing that I make you feel important. You are important. You are amazing. I will do whatever it takes to make sure you know that. ♥️
5/21/19
We’ve been messaging on snap and we said we like each other and you admitted that you feel a little more than like for me. You asked how far I have thought about us into the future. I’ve thought about us being together, living together, spending all of our time together. But, since I told you that I love you and you seemed taken aback, I didn’t want to tell you what I had thought about for the future. I asked you what you had thought about and you admitted that you had thought about us living together and me proposing. Hmmm, I think you might feel a little more than like too ;)

5/22/19
Technically it’s the 22nd. We have been hinting around it for a while but you finally said that you love me. You immediately sent a retraction or tried to set up a meeting for clarification. But before we get into the details and specifications. At least at one point in time, you said that you, nope…at this point you implied that you loved me.
You’re scared. Now you are avoiding the topic. Just like I did.
I asked you if you regretted saying it. You said that you didn't regret it, but maybe it was too early. I totally understand. I don't regret letting you know how I feel, but it was probably too early. You seemed a little scared when I told you. I'm not scared. You make me happy, I want to make you happy too.

5/26/19
I brought you tacos to work today. You were floated over to 3C and you were not happy about it. I hope I at least made it a little better. 

I'm confused, the Snapchat heart… does it mean anything? Am I reading too much into it? IDK

The ex is sending me YouTube videos and I'm not sure how to respond. 

5/29/19
I wish you were here in bed with me.

5/30/19
You stopped by today after your dentist appointment. It was so nice to see you again. I'm sorry I was so tired. This is the middle of my night. You were so cute. I couldn't stop feeling you. You really do make me happy.

5/31/19
I love you.
You sent a cute pic with “♥️ you” written on it. It felt really good to see that, but I was having a terrible night at work. Later you messaged “I like you” and you asked how much I liked you. I love you, but I don't want to scare you so I reply, I like you, a lot. You eventually said that you love me. This time felt so much better. I think you let it slip the first time, but this time was intentional. You are the first thing I think about when I wake up and the last person I think about when I go to sleep. Lol, and even then I dream about you. 
Between my rapid response tonight and my bedside dialysis Cath insertion, my night was terrible and frustrating. You were the bright side to my night. I wish you were here to hold me while I hold you. I like you Sara, and I love you too.
6/1/19
You went to your Co workers 21 birthday party and I hope you had a great time. It looked like fun from your stories, lol. I really want to call you but I know you have to work tomorrow. I hope you know I'm thinking about you. ♥️

6/2/19
You “I like you”
Me “I love you”
You “that's not what I said”
Me “I know, goodnight”
I do like you, and I love you. We constantly talk about being together.I have no idea when the proper time is to say that. I thought maybe since you've told me twice that it would be okay. 
But you immediately panicked, so apparently not at this point. I'm sorry if I scared you.
6/4/19
It was nurses day at Chipotle and I brought you as burrito. It seemed strange seeing all of your Co workers in the break room and I really wanted to kiss you. I was hoping that maybe you would come see me after my shift started. You don't seem to like me much anymore. I know you're busy and school started back up so that's probably it.

6/5/19
So last night you sent a couple messages and panty pics. Maybe you do still like me.
6/6/19
You called me since I finally had a night off. I really like talking to you before you go to bed. You talked about Daved buying new furniture and flooring? Why would he do that if he doesn't plan on staying there? So you two are staying together? But you’re coming over tomorrow? I'm so confused. I don't understand what's going on. I don't know what to do. I want to be with you

6/7/19
You were messaging me earlier and you were supposed to come over after Sims. Well, I haven't seen or heard from you since before sim started.

Well, I messaged you. “so I'm guessing you aren't stopping by?”… and you've left me on read.

“I'm fine, I just IDK”….

You eventually called me and it was nice to hear from you. You swear that you'll come see me tonight after you get off work. I really hope you do. I won't hold my breath. My chest hurts just thinking about getting stood up again.---update--- you showed up! ❤️

6/10/19
I might not get to start Cox when I wanted to. My pathophysiology class didn't show up for summer and I’m super depressed that I might be another semester behind. Talking to you is so comforting. I wish I could talk to you more often. My situation with school is disappointing, but talking to you makes me feel like it will be okay.


Haha, you just gave me a hard time for using a butterfly filter on a lightning bug picture. If you only knew how many times you've given me butterflies. Honestly, I thought that was a feeling I would never have again. I like you.

6/15/19
I stayed after work this morning to come see you. Seeing you makes me happy. We chatted for a while at the desk and then you walked me to the stairs where we chatted more and we kissed a couple times. Once I kissed you, once you kissed me. Hearing you say “I like you” is amazing ❤️


6/16/19
You forgot to come see me after you got off work again. ☹️ We messaged a few times last night. We mentioned how much we miss each other and that we like each other. Then you said that you “extra like me”. I extra like you too ❤️ I have many dirty thoughts, but I hope we can find some time to cuddle for a while soon. I really really really miss doing things with you and spending time with you. 

6/18/19
I miss you. I miss your face, I miss your conversation, I miss your touch, I miss your laugh, I miss the way you giggle and look in the other direction while I'm looking you in the eyes. I miss the way your hair feels in my hands. 

I went to see Tech N9ne and I really wish you could have been there. I've never seen so many girls at a concert and it made me miss you even more than I normally do. 
6/19/19
You messaged me this morning when you had to pee, lol. At least you were thinking about me. I think about you all of the time. I have to restrain myself from messaging you too often. Tonight Hinder is in town, I had hoped we would go together. Ugh. There are 1000 things I'd like to do to you, but I would give anything just to make out with you again on my couch. I miss everything about you.

6/20/19
Soo, Hinder sucked. I left early. The opening bands were good, but the new singer was not good. You had to work today and you got floated to 7B. You seemed to have had a good day. You called me in your way home. I like getting to talk to you. You sent a snap that said “you’re weird. I heart you.” I was thinking about how much I like you. We have so many common interests. It's dumb, but you were making hot dogs with sauerkraut and I got excited. You wouldn't save me any, but I still like you ❤️

06/22/19
I stopped after work to see you again. We didn't get much time to kiss since people kept coming down the stairs. I'll never get tired of kissing you. You sent a pic of you in some cute panties. You were bent over on the bed and wow…I'm going to need you in that position more often 😈

06/23/19
You were pretty upset and stressed tonight. I wish I could be there to comfort you.

06/24/19
Another day that I can't sleep. I'm laying here in bed thinking about you. I keep looking at that other pillow. I want to see you looking back at me.

You mentioned that you asked a guy “anything I can do to get you up?” instead of “anything I can do to cheer you up?” that hurts on two levels. You have never offered to cheer me up and you joked about sending the first one to him. So you didn't correct it? You just let him think that's what you meant? I'm not being overly jealous, but I don't like that. I know we're not official, but I am hurt.

06/25/19
I'm beginning to think I'm more invested in this relationship than you are. 

06/26/19
You finally called me. We talked for over an hour. I'm so happy 🙂I enjoy hearing your voice and I like talking to you 🙂

06/27/19
I don't have anything important to say. I'm just thinking about you. ☺️

 
  . ..

My heart hurts. 
I hate hearing how sad you are 
I'm not supposed to tell you that I love you so I won't.
But I do.
I want to cheer you on in everything you do. You are so much more amazing than you think you are.
Fuck it
I said it too early,
I know you don't feel the same way, 
I like you Sara
.
 
..
 ..
Shit
So, do you still read this? 
I just now thought about the fact that I sent you a link….

06/28/19
You came over after fellowship class and we made out on the couch again. I wanted to take you to bed, but you headed for the couch. Kissing you, touching you, biting you, you drive me wild. I could kiss you for days. I really like you.

You sent the most angering video. It was you being so stressed out that you didn't know what to do. You mentioned feeling suffocated and out of control. It was only angering because I couldn't help you fix it. I sent you me feelings. I really wish you could be here where the drama doesn't exist. I just want to hold you. There was one good part, you did say that you got to spend some time with someone you really care about. I hope that was me.

06/30/19
Okay, this may sound strange, but hear me out. You posted in the last couple days that you've gone out to eat with Keely a couple times and then you posted a picture on your way back from getting fazolis.
It reminded me of her comment about us being like brother and sister. She doesn't know what being brother and sister is like. I think she noticed that we have a bond and that we enjoyed each other's company. Her idea of a parents relationship is not quite so loving and friendly. I don't think she had the  words to describe a happy relationship. She just noticed we enjoyed each other. I don't know I may be way off. But I like to think that's what she meant. 
06/30/19 #2
Stop. You sent me a depressing music video. It's another girl getting their heart broken, for the 10th time. There's a point where you have to stop. The thought of them is different than the reality of who they are. I don't know how to make you realize this. You have options for happiness. But you cling onto the thought of changing him into being your Superman. It won't happen. Ugh, I'm so angry right now.
I don't have any crazy dreams. I just want to make you and Keely happy. You mean a lot to me 
Update! 
I should have kept this to myself! 
Apparently Daveds abuse is more comforting than my support. 
Yes, I'm heartbroken, but then again, it always happens. I don't regret a single second I've spent with you.
I hate that I've lost the chance to be with you. 
I'll still be your cheerleader Sara.
You may not have love for me, but I have love for you.
If you were slightly invested in this relationship, you would appreciate this. But it's obvious that you aren't. 
I hope we can still be friends.
You were the one that said,
“I never want you not in my life”
I tried to call you.
You denied me 
I thought we had a connection.
ItDon't ghost me.
If you choose Daved over me, I guess I'll accept that.
You had an option to escape and be happy.
You enjoyed your time with me.
I hate to see you so miserable, you are the girl I dream of.
You are so much fun to be around. 
You are fun to take to dinner. 
You were even fun to be with when we took your daughter to SDC!

My heart hurts so bad. You won't even talk to me. I knew you were too good to be with a piece of shit like me. I just thought I was a better piece of shit than him. I don't even know what to do. I'm lost. I'm hurt. WHY AM I SO TERRIBLE!!!! 
I've loved you for so long, but you don't even care.
I just need everything to end.
“Do you want to go to sleep and never wake up?”
Yes.
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes 

07/06/19
I hate what I wrote previously, but I won't erase it.
My brother Billy died July 5 around 2 in the morning. I was busy at work making jokes about a patient that had been escorted out that day. I was not close to Billy. But I will miss him. We never really got along. But he had three beautiful children. I don't know how I feel or what to feel but but I don't know. We didn't like each other, but I sure wish he was still here. 
As for you Sara, seeing your snaps with David was really hard. You had mentioned that you were going to dinner with him on Friday, but then you also stopped snapping me as much. When your snap slowed down and your messages slowed down I assumed the worst.I’m still not sure where we are but you said you liked me on the phone and you said you extra like me in a message so I hope that’s a good thing.

I really enjoyed our conversation tonight. I know you felt uncomfortable listening but you did a good job. You let me vent you let me talk you let me say whatever I needed to. I could talk to you forever if you would let me. Good night Sara.

07/11/19
I still don't know where we stand I like you but you're awfully quiet I just want to spend a little bit of time with you I asked you to go to dinner hopefully we can find some time I don't know I really really really want to spend time with you I guess if you want to spend time with me it'll happen Good night Sarah I really miss you

You finally responded to me in the middle of the night It was about 2:30 You admitted that you missed me too It was really nice talking to you Good night Sara

07/15/19
I think you like me but I'm not sure. I don't know what to say. You have so much going on with school. I want to be there to support you. That's so hard without any time to spend together. You're so close to being done with school It's amazing. I'm really jealous. Damn it Sara. We keep saying I like you but I hope it means more. I could cuddle the f*** out of you.

07/17/19

Hey we've talked for quite a bit tonight I told you about my accidental dick pic to the ex which was incredibly horrible But I think maybe I got the point of crossed. You mentioned that Daved tried to have sex the last 3 nights and you turned him down.You acted like you were scared of Daved, which really scared me. If you need a place to escape I have plenty of mattresses blow up mattresses. I don't know I just wish you were here. Good night Sara.

07/18/19
You did some tanning today and got a bit of accelerator on your forehead. I thought it was funny, but I don’t think you did. You told me you need some sex, so do I. We both have to work the next 2 days so maybe I’ll get to see you for a minute.

07/22/19
Well, we didn't see each other this weekend. Last night you told me that Arthur was bothering you again so I messaged him and asked him to stop hitting on you. You always complain about him doing that. He proceeded to tell me that you like it and he threatened me. Then I'm assuming he told you because you asked me about it. I told you what happened and you admitted to flirting with him. You said it had been months, but we've joked about him for longer than that. You seemed angry that I said anything. Am I just a flirt too? Are you seeing him?  Can I really trust you? What's the full truth? 
07/24/19
Well, you called me at 1 in the morning after we messaged for a while. You had a drink and you played with your new vibrator tonight. Seeing your post orgasm smile was quite a turn on. When you called me you said you love me. I don't think you'll admit it though

07/28/19
I've ignored the red flags for too long. You went floating with another guy. You didn't post any pictures, which was super strange for you. Then the only pic you shared was of him. I can't convince you to go out to eat, but you can go floating with him? I think you just enjoy me chasing you. Everyone I talk to tells me to leave you alone. 


Maybe this isn't about you.
Maybe this is about me.
I want to be loved 
I want to be appreciated as much as I appreciate them.
I'm tired of throwing my heart at people and them just taking it. 
I want someone who will throw their heart back

Sara.
I'm sorry. 
I love you.
I'm sorry that I love you.
It's becoming painfully clear that you don't love me.
You messaged me this morning complaining about Daved. 
What on Earth makes you think that is okay?
I love you 
I hate it, but I do.

07/30/19
I took Harley for donuts this afternoon, then I went for drinks with Jennie. It's amazing how they can make time for me, but you can't. I tried to see if you wanted to go to a concert Friday, but you work so weekend. My sister wants to go and maybe I'll have to see if Sai wants to go to. We always talked about seeing a show together. I really miss seeing you though. It's not the same when I hang out with these other girls

08/02/19
You sent me a pic of a conversation from a stranger, then you bet me you could get a dick pic before the night was over.

I'm so fucking stupid.

In the end, I hope I find someone who loves me as much as I loved you. And I hope you find someone who loves you as much as I did too.
And I hope you are honest with them.♥️l
GN Sara

08/03/19
And you message me that you miss me again. This is too confusing.

08/04/19
When you said you missed me, I told you I missed you too. I said that we need to actually make plans. You asked when I worked, so I thought you wanted to do something. I offered to bring you lunch at work. You read the message early in the morning but you didn't reply until you were on lunch break. I joked that I never thought you'd turn down food. You replied that you didn't turn down food, you ate. Haha, so you didn't turn down food, you just turned down food with me…



I still haven't stopped talking to her.

If you've made it this far, thank you."
I don’t know. I just don’t know. I don’t know what I want to do with my life. I don’t know my likes and dislikes. I don’t know who I am. The only thing I know is that I will never amount to anything. I’m majoring in something that I’m not even sure I wanna do. I will be a second year in college next month and I’m scared. I’m scared that I’m just wasting my time and money. I’m scared that I will be a disappointment to my family. I’m scared that I will not get a good job after college. I’m just so lost right now. I feel like I’m falling to pieces and I don’t have anyone to talk to about it because none of them understand. They don’t understand me because they know what they want to do with their lives.
"I’ve always wanted something I’ve never had. The closest I got to it was Jon and Davy’s group. Even then I was looking in from the outside. I should have tried harder to push my way in. But that’s done now. 

Today, I’m farther from it than I have been in a long time. Forget meaningful relationships and laughter and support. Forget creative tête-à-tête and shared inspiration. My most loyal and apparent companions are two puppies and an aloof cat. My laughter is shared with a strange, fractured man who breaks my heart more than once a day. The rest, I’m on my own for. 

No Oliver today. No Audrey, no Alex, no Charlotte. No lovely sweet guys that like surfing and think I’m amazing. 

The closest I’ve got now is pulling at the tendrils of soft imitations. A text to Jonsi a month, a message to Dolores every two. Long phone calls with Nikki after hefty gaps. Grasping at a relationship with Taylor that’s become so ghostly and transparent that I can barely focus my eyes enough to make out the outlines. We’re supposed to be best friends. It’s so blurry. 

So here I am, thinking of all the people who ask “Written your best selling novel yet?” Sure, it may not be a serious question or elaborately contemplated. Still, it takes me aback- the number of people who have confidence in me. And the amount of confidence I lack. 

I miss being 24 and planning my escape to Chicago. Someday, I’ll miss being 28 and planning my escape to... somewhere. The possibilities have always been brighter than the result- the reality I land on. Is that because I dream too beautifully and see too bleakly? Or is just that my time has yet to come? 

Edit: Spelling and Grammar"
"My ex girlfriend and I were having problems, and it seemed like she just started falling out of love with me. Eventually things blew up and she wanted a break from me and broke things off, I was heartbroken. I think I cried for a straight week. Today would’ve been our anniversary.

Two weeks later and I still feel so miserable, I can’t get my mind off of her. I’ve been focusing on my internship, getting back into hobbies, working out, playing video games, and making plans with friends, but she and what happened are still on my mind all the time.

My college friends are away, and even then I only have a few people I can call a true friend. My girlfriend was my emotional support and best friend but now thats been kicked from under me. I only have a few more neighborhood friends and high school friends I can hangout with, but I feel like I can’t open up to them without being a burden or getting judged. I have never felt more miserable and lonely. I feel like I’m in a hole with no ladder in it. It’s such a large contrast from only a year ago. I just want this to end."
"Moving cities is not an easy task. It's messy, expensive and tiring. Like getting a surgery or going through an accident, it takes time to regroup and recover before getting back into the thick of things. 

Moved to my old city with wife and kiddo in tow. A truck full of things from the house and hearth. So many things, it's unbelievable how much stuff one can accumulate if one stops to pay attention.   There were boxes of books and utensils and clothes and toys. By the end of it there were 40+ cartons and 20 units of other stuff. 

Loaded it all in the truck and the final bill was more than what I expected and I had to grit and bear it. It's expected when moving, but still. The lesson to learn here is to lock down on the final price and not budge from it. But I was too tired ans exhausted from supervising the loading team and telling them what to pack and how to pack it. Brutal people though. Brutal with handling the stuff, but they were quick. I gave them generous tips and the guy still had the audacity to ask for more. Oh well, that's how it rolls I guess. 

Reached the new city, technically old, but wife and kid are here for the first time. New for them. The truck with all the stuff here reached next morning. The guys unloaded it all and the packing was left to us. Whoops. Big mistake. Unpacking all that stuff is even more of a pain than getting it packed. 

The shitty part happened next when it started raining and the whole street got waterlogged. Water entered the house and that was a mess because we sold the bed we had and brought just the big mattress that weighs upwards of 40kg and it's an unwieldy monster of a thing. To drag it and place it somewhere away from the water was a pain in itself. 

The water receded in a few hours when the rain was over but it left a mess that is going to take some more days to unravel. So yes. Epic fuckups from every side. 

And now it's raining again. Great."
"The Fourth is coming up, and I've been debating on whether or not I should go to the city to see the festivities with my own eyes. It would be nice to see fireworks over the river while folks sing along with the music, but traffic is going to be abominable, and that goes twice for security and all the other ""characters"" I'll no doubt encounter there. It's really a thing for tourists, honestly. Most residents of the city stay home and cook BBQ or move out of state to meet with their friends and families. 

The amount of DUIs last time was ridiculous, but expected. For anyone who's reading this, I know I'm going to repeat myself ad nauseam about this, but please, *please* do not drink and drive. It is such an easily avoidable thing, and you'll not believe the amount of drivers who've lost their lives over something so preventable. Take a cab, an Uber, Lyft, a bus, the subway, or carpool or walk home--any other option is better than driving drunk home. And that's *if* you can make it home in one piece. The famous last words for any drunk driver is, ""It's only a few minutes down the road."" Don't put your life or others' in jeopardy because your pride got in the way.

I heard back from a few employers. They said no. I'm not angry anymore because I've learned to manage my expectation levels. There's no reason to get upset, and I've got some good news too! My uncle introduced me to a guy who may be able to get me into the biotech industry again. I'm not getting excited because...well, you already know why. Anyway, I'm going meet him next week, after all of this holiday rush passes by. He seems like a cool dude, but we'll see how he is in person. He asked me to meet him at a fancy pants college in a rich town, just outside the city limits. I know where it is, and when I say ""fancy pants"" and ""rich town"", I'm being dead serious. It could be my ticket into the industry again, but I'm still banking on academia to say ""yes"".

So, this is what's come to? Me making decisions based on money versus my passion in helping people? I'm not a child; I know I can do both. But, I'd be a fool to think that academia pays better than industry. I don't necessarily *need* that kind of money...but it would certainly help things run smoother on my end. It would also help my family pay off their debts, especially my brother's and sister's college tuition.

What a time to be alive. In the meantime, some poor bastard is getting his head caved in because he simply at the wrong place at the wrong time, or worse. And here I am complaining about getting a job versus one that may pay much more."
"Last night, before going to bed, I wrote in my journal ""you will sleep through the night -soundly and remember your dreams.""  Normally I just wish myself sweet dreams. 

Middle of the night I woke up and told myself, ""no, you are going to sleep through the night."" I turned over, and fell asleep! Miracle!  And had some weird dream about being in China, getting smashed with a bunch of friends, and a magic t.v. where the people stepped out of the screen and began to clean the house which was a total wreck because we had all partied hard and had fallen asleep on the floor. 

Please note. I do not get wasted or attend parties like that in my real life.

Also, for the first time in weeks my legs weren't aching me when I woke.

Morning mood: ++++++++"
"I have nightmares I guess I would call them, quasi-nightmares really that are fairly regular. Losing my shoes, or keys, getting on the wrong bus or getting confused on how to get somewhere, losing my phone, or my phone being in some way difficult to use or operate.

All of which leave me feeling lonely, abandoned and rejected.

Last night some of those elements were in my dream, but they were all flipped. 

I couldn't find my way home, but then my house was there. Couldn't find my keys to get in, but someone was, despite the house being dark, home and let me in, couldn't find my keys, then dug deeper, and my keys were there. 

I know that sounds rather dull, everything worked out! Yet I woke with such a sense of peace.

It is as if something is switching inside me. I'm feeling confident about myself, my value in life. My worthiness."
"My mind feels a bit dull today. I am not energized by anything. I'm not tired just unenthused, as if some vital force has been sucked out of me.

I need to go into the city, and hopefully being out and about will wake me up a bit. 

At least I will be able to get my fave lunch; a smoothie. One of the workers there recognizes me now and always has this joyful smile on his face when he sees me.

It is amazing how much a simple.smile.can mean."
"I just realized that I’m the most boring person out there. I don’t do anything and I have no real interest in anything. When people asked me questions like “what are your hobbies?” I literally have nothing to say. I say the basic answers like I just watch Netflix, listen to music, read, etc. But the truth is I don’t even watch Netflix that much or read that much. I also hate the question “what’s your favorite color, genre, flower, show, blah blah?” Because I seriously don’t have a favorite anything. I’m just so boring. I’m not passionate about anything. I’m just there occupying space. I’m not good at anything either. I feel like my life is worthless and it wouldn’t make a difference if I just disappear. Everyone would just keep on going with their lives and they all wouldn’t even notice that I’m gone. In the words of the great lyricist Tablo, “I’m afraid I’ll be a book that no one reads. Music that no one listens to anymore. I’m afraid I’ll be abandoned like a movie playing in an empty theater.”"
"I feel a little bit better tonight, but not much. I'm still salty about not getting the job and the fact that the primary interviewer cut the interview short. The feeling is mutual, of course, but I still took a personal hit from it. Ah, well, better luck next time.

And with that being said, in the meantime, I've been applying for other positions. Honestly, at this point, these entries are going to be an autobiography on how many possible interviews I can get before landing a permanent job. But, well, this is really the only place I can vent without exploding from all the stress. 

Nothing really happened today. I went with my family to eat at some seafood place in a small town near the ocean. It's a cozy, little town, but there were tons of people. Places like that always excited me so much when I was a kid, and I always fantasized about living in a place like that forever. Then, as I got older, I started realizing how boring and mundane life would be living there. It's a small town, there's hardly anything to do, and everyone practically knows each other. No thanks...but, you know, a place like that seems very peaceful, and that's something I would enjoy so much.

I want peace of mind right now. Like I said, I'm still upset about what happened. I should handle rejection like an adult--a professional--by now, but I feel sorely agitated by all of it. I guess I'm just impatient and angry at this point. Despite this, I still need to grin and bear it so I can give myself a good image. If I keep my cool and treat most people with respect, surely something good will come my way. It's happened before and it'll happen again, I'm sure of it.

My luck has always been strange. I'm either stuck in the worst case scenario possible or I'm experiencing the most euphoric moment ever. It's never in between, but I suppose that's a textbook definition of luck for everyone.

I'll simmer down eventually as this is just passing aggression, nothing more or less.

Goodnight, folks."
"Before I begin I would like to preface this post by giving some context. I am college student who is currently taking a Feminist Theories class in which I have been given an assignment to read *Living a Feminist Life* by Sara Ahmed and create a reading log in which we achieve a deeper understanding of the book through logging personal experiences, daily actions, and how our new knowledge builds off of what we have previously learned. We were given free reign on how to construct this log so I chose to to turn to Reddit, and more specifically this sub, as a place to journal my way through this book. I am aware that this space (while it is for more than just this) is a place for expression of daily life and personal experiences. I will have this in mind as I journal for it is the foundation of all my posts to come and as I hope that it well help me to achieve an overarching goal of mine: to use a feminist lens to find patterns in my past that continue to construct my present and future. If you read through my journal and would like to share experiences of your own or comment on what I have written, that would make me completely over the moon. Cheers!

**Chapter 2 - ""On Being Directed""** 

&#x200B;

**Entry 1 - Swimming Upstream** 

**""When I was wearing, I found it wearing""** (Ahmed, 48). 

Being in large, crowded spaces has always made me panic. My eyes flick from face to face, it feels as if they are all staring at me. I know they are not but I can't convince myself of otherwise. My heart is racing and my breaths become quick and shallow. There is something about swimming in a pool of people that makes me retract in on myself, makes me want to fold into myself and become as small as possible. 

For as long as I can remember, I saw this feeling as permanent and unchangeable. I was doomed to always think that I was going to be swept away in a crowd that I was so desperately trying to feel a part of while living in fear of my fraudulence being exposed. I wanted the crowd to feel like home. To have a place to stay and feel welcomed. But the truth was that I did not feel at home in the crowd. 

To depart from the crowd meant to depart from comfort. To depart form collective thought and decision. To swim upstream. 

As I swim upstream, I find the water to be refreshing. The rumors of turbulent rapids and all consuming waves are true, but only partly. Navigating new waters was wearing, but not nearly as wearing as feeling out of place in the collective. And now that I have reached the secret streams that reside away from the currents of complacency, I feel at home. 

&#x200B;

**Entry 2 - The Happiness Dilemma** 

**""To disappoint an expectation is to become a disappointment""** (Ahmed, 52). 

Feel guilty for your happiness. What gives you happiness is what attacks my happiness. How could you ever be happy if what makes me happy does not make you happy? Do you feel happy yet? Now that I have told you what should make you happy? 

The pressure to be happy demeans the very essence of what it means to be happy. Due to the subjective nature of happiness, aren't all of our means of happiness relative and equal? Do our varying experiences that we actively construct not give us the ability to live fluidly and freely in our happiness without fear of it being criticized, devalued, or even ripped away? It should, yet it does not. The human desire to place things on a value system alludes to a major flaw we as a species posses: to view and understand existence through binaries. If something is this, it must not be that. If I am right, you are wrong. If you are not with us, you are against us. By valuing things and being as ""good"" or ""bad"", which are subjective and not concrete classifications, we reject the notion of existing outside of these bounds. This then in turn creates a volatile borderland in which those who choose to exist beyond these parameters find themselves and their happiness at great risk, especially when those reinforcing the binary are willing to protect their own happiness no matter what the cost. 

In this case, I feel the binary that exists is happiness and fear. When we find happiness, we begin to fear losing it; fear the next time that we will not be happy. I wonder if, subconsciously, we feel an innate desire to protect what makes up happy, even when it is completely out of our control to do so. To protect our happiness, are we willing to take someone else's away from them if it poses a direct threat to ours? I think we do. Everyday. 

A study called The Happiness Dilemma discusses how the ebb and flow of living between states of happiness and unhappiness is part of what makes us as a species continue to show up to work, stay motivated, and continue on with our lives. I mention this because while reading this chapter I thought about how there are people who think winning the lottery will solve all of their problems and will ultimately lead to them living happily for the rest of their life. However, an overwhelming majority of  people who win the lottery end up feeling a great deal of loss and sadness as people in their lives turn on them and they discover life with money was not how they thought it would be. This led me to thinking that pure happiness must arise from pure intentions and without conditions. I believe this to be same for when we feel love. If it is not pure and unconditional, are you truly in the presence of happiness and love? 

I see happiness and love as falling hand in hand - two puzzle pieces that fit perfectly into place. Ahmed discusses the conflict that arises for a parent when their child comes out as gay. The parent will automatically believe that their child cannot live a happy life, casting unhappiness on themself and their child. However, this unhappiness does not arise from the child's inability to find love and happiness in a homosexual relationship, it arises from the way the parent's happiness feels attacked when their child will not follow the supposed recipe to happiness that, when followed, skews us all into believing the answer to happiness is through following fatalist agendas and reinforcing binaries. In this sense, what we have come to know as happiness is a facade. If a woman is only happy in a relationship when it is with a man, why would a woman who loves other women feel anything but happiness if she were forced to be with him? We must reconstruct our idea of what happiness in effort to restore its intended meaning."
"I want to start writing.

&#x200B;

I love my views on life, and I love the person I am. Although I do feel that if i was to suddenly pass away and somehow be able to judge my own life it would result in me feeling as if I have failed.

&#x200B;

I believe the meaning of life is to find happiness. There is no point to life if you don’t find happiness. In order to find happiness you need to be able to identify who you are, and what you want out of life.

&#x200B;

We are given one life to live, and we share our world with billions. We should pay the privilege of life forward by leaving the world a better place so more people could find the enjoyment and happiness that I have found.

&#x200B;

Discovering my purpose has been a difficult adventure. Initially I felt a desire in life to support, and care for my parents. I loved who they were, and growing up I wanted nothing more than to help them as best as I could. I grew up with a great sense of pride and felt as if it was my responsibility to do everything in my power to help them.

&#x200B;

In my eyes, as a male I have the role and responsibility of being a “man”. Part of being a man in my opinion is being the biggest person I could possibly be, and sacrifice myself for what I value.

&#x200B;

Martin Luther King once said “If a man hasn’t found something he will die for, he isn’t fit to live.”

&#x200B;

I believe as a man my responsibility is to sacrifice myself for what I value. Growing up I thought I should value my parents, but when I had my first born I realized I was bringing in a completely innocent child onto this planet who is incapable of surviving on their own. As a Man it is my responsibility to make sure I help my creation as best as I can. When my relationship with my parents interfered with the health of my child I realized cutting them out of my life was the correct decision.

&#x200B;

Today I have 3 children who I feel are young but growing up selfish. I want them to be selfless, compassionate and understanding of those around them. I want to leave them with wisdom, and true love for eachother but it has been difficult.

&#x200B;

I look at society and I see the biggest problem is that those who are different get outcasted, and people generally look down on those who are different without understanding circumstances or situations. That type of behavior brings negativity. I want the world to be a better place, and in order to become a better place we have to teach our children to have compassion for those who are different.

&#x200B;

I’m not sure how to teach wisdom, or philosophy to my kids. I have been unsuccessful thus far but I do feel the best way to understand someone is to hear their thoughts. Thus I want to start writing daily. Because life is not guaranteed, and If i do suddenly pass at least some of my thoughts and insights will be available to potentially help them."
"Someone once asked me what my biggest fear was. At the time, I told them it was people. And, with such fear, comes hate. I had a hatred and fear against people, and society in general. But, as I grew older and got more and more experience by interacting with different kinds of people and going out more often, that phobia started to dissipate. I started realizing that people aren't really so bad. Maybe a little cranky and grumpy, and maybe they just hate where they are in life currently. If you scratch them hard enough, however, you'll find an optimist who's still got hope and dreams in them. It's always been like this, but I'm now just becoming part of it.

There is one fear, however, that has been plaguing me. If that same person from years ago were to ask now what my biggest fear is, it would be being alone. Not necessarily loneliness, and I think most people like to enjoy their own company. No, it's the fear of one day, who knows, I'll be alone forever.

Let me tell you about a dream I had recently. I was inside of a stairwell in a large building, with tan-colored bricks and a musty atmosphere. I immediately recognized it as the high school I went to and graduated from. It was during the day when the sun's rays were shining through the window, and I just sitting on one of the steps in the stairwell, just looking out into the window and the light. Then, slowly, the sun began to fall and it became dark. It became so, so dark. I remember crying out for someone. I checked the entire school: the gym, classrooms, auditorium, hallways and hallways of each building, everywhere. I tried calling out names of classmates I once knew, but nobody came. No answer; no response. I could feel a grip over my chest, and then I woke up. I couldn't move an inch. It was still dark and I was frozen in a cold sweat in my bed. I started crying.

I don't want to be alone. I've always been a solitary person, for better and for worse, but as I get older I'm starting to realize that many of my friends and family are not going to be around here anymore. 

I'm scared; I'm afraid. I've been trying to focus on getting a new job now, ever since I quit my old one recently. I'm sometimes scared to go to sleep because I feel like I'll have the same nightmare.

My friends and family keep asking me when I'm going to get a woman in my life and marry her. I tell them, ""When I can feel confident in myself."" They laugh, but I don't have the heart to tell them everything.

My fear of people and society is slowly ebbing away, but I can't even put trust into someone else to come into my life.

I need to lie down and think, but I'm afraid of falling asleep."
"It’s almost been a year since we officially broke up, almost seven months since we really ended things. 

When people ask me how long it’s been I say it’s complicated, I don’t want to say it’s been a year. He treated me the same those five months later, so it’s really more like seven months. A year later and I’m still talking about him? That makes me seem crazy, well I should say crazier. Seven months is yep getting along with things, seven months is I should be dating again and not still thinking about him. 

I think back to before him. How did I get over the person before him? Well I met him. I replaced one ex with another. I met him five months after my previous relationship. I was never over the other guy when I met him. Being with him made me get over him. So my solution to getting over this last relationship is by getting into another one. I’ve never learnt to move on, I just replace them. 

I still want to be with him even though I know I shouldn’t, and it’s been ages. I want to be in a relationship again, but I don’t see myself in one with anyone else. 

I tried calling again the other day with my caller ID off, it rang a couple times then went straight to voicemail. He knows now that it’s probably going to be me calling if it’s an unknown number, so he knows to hang up. I feel like a creep, a stalker, a crazy ex when I do it, it doesn’t make me feel good about myself. I know it’s bad. I just want to talk to him. I never had a conversation with him, he just ghosted me pretty much. Seven months later and it still bothers me. Seven months later and I’m still going nuts thinking about it. I want to contact him with another email of mine, but I’m afraid he’ll literally try and charge me with stalking or something. I don’t know what to do, can anyone help?"
"One of my Facebook friends asked me this a few days ago, and I promised him a more comprehensive answer than the usual arguments about inclusion -- they aren't feminist, in the least.

I'm brown (Moroccan), I have a funny accent (Dutch), I'm short, I prefer [TAOCP]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321751043) to Sports Illustrated, and so on. 

Whilst male, I don't feel like the MRAs include me. Now, a bunch of women don't either (for obvious reasons). 

However, I don't get put down by them and made to feel bad for things I have no control over. If I ever need emotional support, the MRAs in our midst will do anything **but** support me, whereas the feminists in our midst have. 

While I have male friends, I also have female friends -- hell I'm married to a woman and have a daughter. But, even before I met my wife (or had our daughter), I saw the men's rights movement as an oddity, the way moderates see extremists in our midst. There were a few, they didn't bother me, and I didn't bother them. 

Then they took it upon themselves to threaten my wife at Tesco for being married to me. Then they took it upon themselves to threaten us at a football game in Glasgow. Then their views on the EU prevailed in 2016 and they formed the core for Trump's victory later that year; and I began to, perhaps reluctantly, throw my lot in with feminists.

In conclusion, if I had to choose a side, I choose the side of acceptance of differences, the side of not being judged, the side of not issuing threats based on who we choose to love or what gender our children are. In short, I choose feminism."
"I feel terrible. I think I'm gonna call in sick for tomorrow. God willing, my manager doesn't come in and cancels work for me via email. 

I couldn't sleep last night. Too much stress and running thoughts--horrible, horrible thoughts.

I want to scream; I want to cry. But nothing is coming out of me because I've exhausted enough energy on those emotions.

I've given up hope on getting a better job. Those assholes are never going to answer me. Any communication I try to give is stonewalled by the same, bullshit cookie-cutter response. I want to strangle someone.

I'm getting vexed from my lab manager. His stupid sarcasm is starting to grind my gears even more, and oh, god *forbid* I ask him a question! Mr. I'm-Too-Important-To-Be-Bothered will take it as a sign of stupidity. How's that for sarcasm, prick?

Next week, I'm quitting. I can't take this fucking place anymore. I shouldn't even be in this type of work. I never wanted to be here in the first place. And, for what it's worth, the pay actually does suck. People look like they want to die on the inside when they come to work here. And that loud-mouthed engineer with the attitude is really asking for a kick in the nuts.

I don't feel good. I just want to melt away in my bed, but I also don't want to sleep because I'm afraid of what comes next."
"Too much on my mind, and part of it is coming from the fact that I'm expecting to hear back from my potential employers very soon.  The first thing they're going to ask, if I should get an interview, is, ""Why do you want to leave your current job?""  I know that's the first thing they'll ask me.  Then they're going to dig deeper and deeper into my employment history, unless the interviewers are not too pushy.  I just need to answer like a lawyer: give them the truth, but only answer questions as is.  

Anyway, yeah, that's pretty much all that's on my mind.  Nothing amazing happened today, although I suppose, coming from my personal history, that's a good thing.  I sometimes wonder what happened to the old crew I hung around with.  Actually, I probably don't have to wonder too much.  I know a few of them are dead--actually, quite a few, I might add.  All of them killed over something petty and stupid, except one who had an addiction problem.  I wonder what they'd say if they saw me now.

I saw what happened on the news in New Zealand, and very recently, in The Netherlands.  What a world.  But it's always been like this, hasn't it?  It's easier to access global atrocities being committed than it was decades ago.  I really don't want to think too much about it.  I've already enough trouble here at home with myself and family, and among other things and people.

A certain cousin of mine told me he's ""getting his life back together with a new job"".  Hah!  New job, my ass.  If he can only hold down one long enough, then maybe I'll be impressed.  I guess he's going to skip out on the parts in his resume where he wanted to fight customers and get into shouting matches with his former managers.  He's never going to change for the better--never.

On that note, I'm ending this entry.  Good night."
"Gonna be driving my brother back to his campus tonight.  It's bittersweet seeing him leave, but it's not like we're worlds apart.  Still, I am a bit sad him and our sister are heading back.  Sis is getting a lift from mom and dad, but she's much farther than bro.  Their freshman year will be over before I know it, which is a good thing.  I'll have to get ready for tonight.

Oh, and happy St. Patty's Day!  The parade is happening in the city right now, but I'd rather not go.  It's too cold, and there're always drunken idiots who ruin the whole thing for everyone.  The last time I went, some knucklehead threw a loaded beer bottle into the air and it landed on a police officer's dog.  Brilliant idea, dude.  Also, all the restaurants are practically closed in the city, it being a Sunday and all.  The pizza shops are open on the main street area, but the owners of the shops charge customers a criminally high price.  Forget it; I'll stay right here.

Nothing really much else to say.  Once again, I'm waiting on my contacts from my potential employers to see where they're gonna take me for the possible job hiring.  And, yes, once again, I'd like to voice my displeasure at this whole ballroom dance business at just simply getting audience with people from these organizations.  It sucks.

Time to make some breakfast."
"I've been feeling pretty... Numb lately. I don't know the right way to describe. Maybe I'm more scared of being diagnosed with depression and anxiety than scared of having depression and anxiety itself. I fear I'm a lazy piece of shit that's trying to justify my behavior pretending I have a mental illness, but I've decided I'm not going to try and diagnose myself. I can afford at least one session with a psychologist this month, I want to see what that's like. 

I've looked up some psychologists here. Living downtown is really cool because a lot of therapists practice close to my home. I got in contact with two so far.

The first one is a lady I really liked. She texted me and explained what the first session is like. It seems like a good way to start. Her practice is a bit far from me (30 minutes walking, bus fare isn't worth it), but she told me she's really flexible with prices and frequency. I've looked her up on Google and she has good reviews too. People describe her in a way that make her seem genuinely empathic and caring.

The other one has a great price and his practice is really close to my college campus. The first session would be two hours long, so I'd get to know him and we could talk without worrying about time. This may be really silly, diary, but my only problem is he's a dude. I rarely talk to guys, I don't know if I'd feel comfortable opening up to him about my insecurities. His name is also so common that I couldn't find him on Google. I'm really tempted to try with him first.

I still have some other options to research, but I'm really excited to try professional help. It's been two and a half quiet years. I want to open up about what I'm feeling, even if my thoughts don't make a lot of sense now. Maybe just talking about it will make me feel better.

On a side note, tonight I'll probably go out to eat fish and chips with my friends. I miss being in the same classes together, but I love them a lot. I probably should tell them that."
"Dear Diary

Getting old sucks.  I took a spill yesterday, and in the past I would have bounced back up with little more than my pride hurting and gotten on with my life.  Not so now.  Oh I hurt all over.  I'm chugging OTC pain meds like they're candy.  

Getting older and death is something I think a lot about.  I always flirt with what the afterlife is like, but I just can't seem to find that one thing that makes total sense to me.  My latest thought experiments come from this paradigm I'm seeing about us being in a simulation.  This is an idea I've flirted with for 30 years, but it seems really prominent now.  It's almost like someone is telling me something.  Trying to send messages into a delusion or dream or vision, a la *Total Recall*.  I keep meaning to ask Sam if feeling like people sending me messages like that is anything like the voices they keep asking me if I'm hearing.  For the record, no I don't hear voices.  But I can't shake this feeling that some kind of message is being aimed at me.  

Being in a simulation would make a lot of sense to me.  I've often felt there were feelings I've had that were from an external source.  I've played with the idea of this simulation being like the Matrix.  I've played with a much smaller population being the simulation inhabitants and we're on some kind of long term cold sleep suspension sleeper ship kind of thing.  With the events of the last three years and how bat shit insane 'reality' has become, I can't help but feel that this reality is some kind of what-if? scenario that's playing out.  Or maybe the writers have gone on strike and I'm simply a background character in someone else's show.  

But I look at these thoughts, and how I feel about them, and realize there's a weariness behind it all.  Sure, it's fun to play around and guess and think of what the bigger picture is.  But at my age I'm just weary of it all and really would prefer someone just tell me what's going on. 

Ah well.  Somethings we are just not meant to ken.  And that's another thought that shows me how old I've gotten.  That used to not be an acceptable answer to me.  I've always wanted to know the why behind the what.  

sotd: *Don't Fear the Reaper*.  One thing I've realized lately is that I sure could use some more cowbell.
"
"This is long. It is a massive wall of text and absolutely unorganized. Do be prepared for a long read if you want to read this. I know no one probably will but I just wanted to get this all off my chest anyway. 

As a kid, I did know something was very wrong with me when going through puberty because I liked my best a lot (and obviously we were two guys [at the time I was anyway]) and I really liked my best friend too. I thought I was gay and I was like that's probably not right because I wanted to be treated more as a girl and I wanted to wear cute clothes but whatever floats my boat was what I thought. I did not realize at the time that the word transgender even existed, so that did not help sort out my feelings one bit. Eventually, as the year went on, I was pushed, literally, and accidentally ended up kissing another guy on the cheek. While I wasn't exactly repulsed by the fact that I kissed a guy on the cheek accidentally, I was more mad that it wasn't my best friend who I had a major crush on. That was also the time the time that I really wanted to wear a wedding dress thing really kicked in, like literally the day after that event because I thought in my head, ""Well, it's okay, [guy I like] will come and help me out eventually, right?"" Turns out I was wrong, no one really did shit, I got mocked for a good while and being called gay and all that other stuff. That passed and a year had gone by.  


The next year, I didn't really have anyone to talk to and I was mostly excluded a lot and bullied by people I knew since I was 4 years old. We mostly played random sports shit during recess and lunch so that was the main focus of that year. I did end up getting bullied for being fat and my mom had bought me fast food for lunch usually and people took my fucking food all the time. I didn't mind sharing with people I knew and that was fine. What I hated was that people took my food without fucking even asking. So, lots of bullying and food stealing went on this year and I had also been enrolled into an afterschool by my parents that was in school after the day had ended. I did make some friends there although a lot of them did think I was annoying, stupid, and had no real good inputs sometimes. That was understandable, we were kids, not everyone saw eye to eye. That year also went really bad because I was being bullied in regular classes and afterschool wasn't terrible because people actually interacted with me, I did feel wanted somewhat. Another thing about that afterschool, there were obviously lots of adults that kept an eye on us and sometimes participated in the sports stuff that we played. We did play handball at some point after all of our homework and the one that stuck with me was I was in one round with an adult. He was like way taller than me and bigger (I was like maybe 4'9 that year) and I had won one round through one random hit that got him out. He got super pissed and downplayed the fact that I won or whatever and honestly, it made me feel terrible. Like a early to mid-20s adult, shitting a fucking 12 year old kid for fucking winning one round at handball. Really? And he wasn't even apologetic about it either after that day, it felt he harbored some resentment against me for that but I'll never know.   


Although as the year progressed, I got bullied a lot more during regular school hours, getting called fat and mocked, having more food stolen from me, insulted and excluded, the usual stuff. I ended up basically failing all of my classes that year. I tried to make up some excuse for it but obviously it did not work because my parents were pissed at me because I also hid all the bad grades, report cards, and failed tests. We also had a team thing that applied to only one class thankfully, but my group leader got really pissed that I failed EVERY SINGLE CLASS. NOT LIKE I COULD HELP IT ANYWAY. That year helped create a lot of insecurities that have stuck with me until this day. I felt extremely worthless and obviously had no value in life. I wanted to die and I was around 12 years old at that time. I ended up starving myself for a while, no one really noticed tbh and I don't think anyone even cared since this was also post 08 crash and more concerns about money and financial stuff. Eventually, I had dropped down to like 80 something pounds (keep in mind, I'm like 4'9) and it was going to drop under that at some point, although I realized that yo I'm starving myself, that shit is not gucci and while not extreme, if it continued, that I could have died. There were some positive things that year like teachers calling me bright if I applied myself but obviously that did not outweigh the other shit stuff that happened. Kids are fucking mean yo. My brother still did stuff with me at home thankfully but that was only because we had each other, and our parents pretty much never let us go anywhere without them or with other kids. Kinda forced interaction but I think he still had fun because we still remember middle school years somewhat fondly. He never knew I was bullied until recently though because he probably could have chucked my bullies and tossed them around like sacks of rice tbh. I did also start karate this year but honestly I was so garbage at it lmao. This was something that did help my self-esteem a bit but not by much.   


So, 8th grade rolls around, I still have a massive crush on the dude I called my best friend, even though we hadn't talked in about a year. Gender dysphoria got way worse like I had started growing body hair and facial hair and I really wanted it to just store and my voice got deeper. Lot of crying about it at night and wanting to just wake up as a girl but people started interacting with me again during regular school hours. Old and new faces started talking to me again, I felt way better although I ended up doing some really creepy shit like randomly coming up behind people and stroking their hair and back or just bearhugging them and stuff. I basically went a whole year without any real physical contact, I was so touch and people starved, I did anything for attention. I ended up kinda being a cunt to one kid, sorry dude. I really do regret this now in hindsight. This year, overall, not very eventful but honestly a happier one and the bullying stopped too, never understood why it happened in the first place because in classes with my bullies, we could easily do group work together but outside of that, I was bullied. Like why??? We also had some team shit from the year prior that applied to all of our classes for whatever reason and have you seen a 12-year-old trying to manage 3 or 4 other 12 year olds and their grades and having to be in charge of the rest of the team also having to complete their homework? Like seriously? Who thought this was a good idea to implement??? My team did really poorly obviously, and I as the leader did not do much better, but I did pass all my classes anyway at the very least. I had to do a majority of all the teamwork though. The teacher that thought of this idea was also a huge history buff and he spent lots of time drilling history into our heads. Lots of big quizzes and watched many documentaries too. That carried me through high school history and college history because I remembered all of that shit. So thank you for that Mr. Teacher dude who I won't name.   


High school started and most it went well, although this point, I basically had become a neckbeard lite kinda and a fucking weeb ass edgy shitlord. I started spouting random poltical shit and other stupid shit. I was still somewhat cunty to the same kid that I somewhat bullied back in 8th grade, I feel really really bad, I want to apologize but I know he'll forgive me probably since he's a really nice dude. I feel like he's probably also forgotten about it now at this point so I don't even know about bringing it up and he's doing really well, I'm glad for him.  High school in general was actually pretty great outside of failing geometry and fucking up my chem grade. I only had to redo geometry during the summer. I spent a lot of time playing games at home mainly an MMO with a company that had to do something with Battle Royale games and lots of cash cow costumes for one race that people played. Nothing super eventful happened in high school. However, mostly interactions with people I was close to really affected me, mainly my brother and some friends. I did get called annoying and loud a lot, told I should shut up, and that I annoyed people. I honestly thought that hey reconnecting with people I knew before was something good and that did make me a little bit happy. I did start feeling worse and worse towards the end of high school because of the building mountain of insecurities towards myself mainly revolving around the same things about being annoyed, fat, and being told to shut up pretty often. You can kind of see a pattern at this point. Also, the fact that I only talked about the one game I played or random DS games I played (mostly Pokemon and RPGs) and maybe some anime shit. Me and my friends did join the anime club, which was actually about anime until it was forced to change into being about Japanese culture outside of anime. Something that kind of really hurt was when I did keep talking about the same MMO to my crush at the time because he had played with his brother and they both quit, but I really enjoyed the MMO and also made friends that I'm still friends with this very day (since I was 16), I know it got repetitive and annoying but I was genuinely excited for it and the updates with it but I think no one wanted to hear about it anymore at this point, including him. It really did crush any positive feelings I had and I ended up playing that MMO for five years even after people I knew quit because that was my outlet for my feelings (mainly being able to dress up my cute characters and also having something that I was good at, somewhat). That usually made me feel a bit better. Parents also tried to force me into extra curricular stuff that I didn't want to do like music, martial arts, going to the gym (understandable but 3-4 hours at the gym every fucking other day with not much rest for my muscles?? Really??) 

 

Post-high school college started and I got really depressed and I felt somewhat lonely, while I still had my brother and we played lots of TCGs together and some other multiplayer games, although he yelled at me a lot and called me shit, honestly I am absolute shit at games but still. He also did randomly burst into my room a lot even when I locked the door and he did insult me quite a bit after high school but that was how we interacted before but he thought it was still okay post high school (more of my fault really because I didn't say anything about it). It made me feel even worse than before in middle school and high school and the stupid mountain of insecurities at this point was not helping. I also read a manga called The Bride was a Boy and that really hit home. It hit hard, at this point, I felt like I was a worthless, useless, disgusting, ugly freak. Along with actually discovering what being transgender was all about hit me like a truck and everything kind of came piling down I suppose. Honestly never would have realized this early in my life had that manga not been published.   


Eventually all the bullying and insecurities and shit did catch up to me, I gained like 60 fucking pounds, I nearly ended up going out and committing suicide because I felt that I was worth less than a fucking shitty old DSi. I felt a fucking 15 year old car had more value than I did. I ended up thinking about multiple ways to kill myself, the only thing that pretty much stopped wasn't mostly the impact that my suicide could have on others around me. I ended up thinking that they'd have to replace the car if I killed myself with it. I think this was honestly my lowest point in life currently. Eventually, I ended up doing something else I never thought I would do and that was going to buy sex toys. I figured if I was going to die, I might as well trying getting some fucking sex toys, maybe that would make me feel better. I eventually ended up going to a nearby sex toy shop where the selection wasn't all that great and I ended up buying stuff like vibrators, some dildos, and thigh-highs. Something that made me feel somewhat human again but it's also really fucking embarrassing was that I bought a huge dildo.   


This thing was bright as fuck, stuck out of the bag, huge, and was thicker than my fucking arm. I was like 5'1 and I was carrying that thing around in broad daylight. I felt so embarrassed but honestly I was happy with myself in that moment. I ended up taking an Uber home, and the driver that day was a woman in her late 20s I think. She saw what I had in my hand and didn't ask my about it thankfully and didn't embarrass me. Instead, she talked about how my day and college and other random stuff and some plans were going or whatever. It made me so happy that someone wanted to talk to me, even if it was forced and was interested in how I was doing. The sex toy thing, however, did somewhat spiral out of control because I ended up sending lots of guys my nudes and constantly sexting random guys simply for validation and positive feedback, also because I was horny. I almost went out to fuck complete strangers that I didn't even know and could have probably taken me somewhere and I might have never come home. I was a naive 18/19 year old during this time frame and I was being really, really stupid. Thankfully, I didn't do that. My brother also thought I was like ace or gay but I was really hiding it or something because I never talked about anything sexual and that really weirded him out for a bit?? BUT SURPRISE, TURNS OUT I WAS TRANS. 

 

Eventually another 2 years down the line from this, which is currently this year, I'm glad I didn't decide to kill myself. I ended up coming out to some friends and my brother, although he was the one that figured out that I was trans without me having to tell him because he realized that I really, really hated any body hair and masculine features. And as a result of that, he took me to a doctor and I started HRT recently.💜 I suppose I could say this journey was worth it or something but I think what I really want to say is that, please do be kinder to people. I know people can be mean as children and I think parents should teach their kids to be nicer, rather than being cunts. I know home problems can contribute to bullying, but I hope more people teach positivity rather than hate. I really hope teachers and other adults can be good role models towards children in this day in age because they probably really need it.  It can make a huge difference, if I had someone during the times that I went through and stuck with me, it would have been very different. It can make a huge impact on others, so if someone you knew before is going through some dark times, reach out to them. 💜💜"
"Tomorrow is the day that could go well or could go miserably. It might lead me to another failure, which is one thing I probably wouldn’t be able to withstand. I’ve been in that position too many times, and I’ve reached a point where if it happens again, I’ll probably just break apart. 

I’ve been told so many times I’m not good enough, or I’m not what you want, and that’s not something I can handle again. So I need some good news. "
"Dear Diary.

Sorry, Diary. It's another one of those days. But if I don't make the effort to say that, I fear I will stop writing again. This may not mean much to others, but I'm doing this for me and not anyone else. I have to make this effort.

Maybe tomorrow will be better. No, tomorrow will be better.

"I was really sick over Christmas, I couldn't keep anything in me, I think I was basically off my medication for five days because nothing was staying in me and that coupled with how hard the Christmas and new year period hi my mental health put me in a pretty bad place.

I have new scars, I have new scars and I'm so ashamed of it but I want to do it more, I keep day dreaming about it, I fall asleep with my knife beside me because it brings me comfort. 
The only way I'm battling it is because my body was off my meds it means the quitiepine hits my like a truck and I fall into a deep sleep pretty quickly so that's what I've been doing, when it hits the quiet of the deepest night and I want to feel those endorphins and adrenaline I pop a pill and try to knock myself out before I weaken. I just feel so bad when F See's my arm and the new cuts, she's such a empathetic human and I know it hurts so deeply, I need to be better so it stops hurting other people but I'm so tired, I haven't been able to regulate my mood at all and I'm struggling so much, I want to feel better, even just neutral but it's so far off.

I at least wrote some things, new years was full of drugs and it gave me relief from myself, I was able to travel to the deep and interesting parts of my brain and create, it was nice not being me for some time and it was nice feeling inspired.

I've also now had three people tell me they thought I was autistic from the perspective that they were as well and could see the signs, D is 100% certain, I guess I'd be inclined to agree, it'd make sense, I should probably take it as a push to go get diagnosed but how do I even have that conversation and how stupid would I feel if myself and the others were wrong, I could just be fucked in the head, it wouldn't surprise me, my life is a constant shit show, I don't know what to do about this, it's confusing, people are confusing, figuring out how to navigate this stuff is confusing.

At least I might be working the splore festival, maybe that make up for all the other festivals I missed cause I've been sick, maybe it'll feel more like I'm doing something other than hating myself while on a couch and trying to offer words of comfort and advice to others so they don't realize just how bad I am right now.

I still miss my computer, I may have a job now but it's only part time at a bar, it's going to be dead for a much longer time, I wish I could make music, I want to make music inspired by my writings and share it with people.

I don't know what to do anymore, I wish I felt like I belonged in this world but this world definitely doesn't want me in it."
"Tomorrow is the day when, hopefully, the bandages on my left arm are removed. I'm excited to get full mobility on my left wrist again. (Bandages restrict full movement of my hand.) 

My left hand feels normal right now, which is good. When I finally get the bandages out, the first thing I'll do is to test out how well I can move it. Adterwards, not sure.

Hopefully, I also get a full release form tomorrow so I can go back to work for a while. Classes start soon, so I'll have to ask to get laid off, or quit, before then. I'll do it when the time is right.

"Lust, fear, and rage. Like the opposite of faith, hope, and love.


All are powerful and passionate.  


Emotions can shape/change thoughts, words and actions.  


Which is why it is so important to learn how to control your thoughts, words and actions in the midst of overwhelming emotions.  


Pain, the great teacher, heart tenderizer, the great stimulator.  Pain hurts all it touches.  How we respond is what matters most.  Pain can soften hearts, or harden them.  Soft hearts heal so much fast than hardend hearts.  

Natural tendencies aww are to run from and fight pain. Like childbirth though, what if instead of fighting the pain, we embrace it?  Let it wash over you, relax and accept the pain.  It hurts so much less. Pain is inevitable.  Fight it not. Make peace with pain. Heal.


Emotional hearts are like playdough.  Soft ones are easily shaped no matter how destroyed they get.  Hard playdough has to be broken down completely and added softeners to it before it can start being reshaped.  Hardend hearts shatter while soft heart get dented. 


Who shapes your heart?  The people you love and trust. Surround yourself with people who are how you want to be.  They will help you grow into who you want to be."
"  

I have been thinking as to why I am taking the situation at work so personally. After all, it's like the Godfather said, ""It's just business"". I have a theory which frankly is half-baked, but I am going to think about it. I think it has to do with my need to please authority figures.

My youngest memories are of me trying desperately to get approval from my parents and teachers. I remember this from as early as kindergarten. My parents demanded that they be respected, obeyed and honored. I would get a severe beating if I crossed the line. So, I was always nervous about making sure I did the right thing. Back in the day, the school I went to also allowed corporal punishment. I remember being hit several times on the knuckles with a ruler by my teacher because I did not write neatly enough. 

Every time I was punished either at home or at school, I died inside. It just killed me to think that the love I had been trying to get was not there. I wanted to do the right thing and be loved for it, and for the most part I was considered a ""good kid"". Maybe a little too good by some standards. I was afraid of my own shadow and so I did not speak unless spoken to, I did not ask for toys or candy when we went shopping...I stayed within myself. 

I think There was a lot of anger and resentment building up inside of me because of the abuse. How could these people...my parents and teachers...hurt me so bad when they were supposed to love me? I was trying so hard to be good and yet, I was still being mentally, verbally, and physically abused. I think even at that age, I realized that something was fucked up in this world. 

I wanted to be an authority figure. I thought that would stop the cycle of violence. In school, I became a School Safety Patrol Officer and eventually was promoted to captain of the Safety Patrols. The teachers loved me, and I was allowed special privileges in school such as leaving class early. 

As an adult, I joined the local volunteer fire department and became a volunteer firefighter and EMT. I also rose to the rank of captain in the department. I must admit, being a FF/EMT brought me a lot of satisfaction and pleasure. Finally, people were looking up to ME. Finally, I could drive fast and not get caught, or stop traffic, or help someone who really needed it. This was especially apparent after 9/11, everyone was in awe of firefighters and I would get thanked by kids and grown ups alike. I'll be the first to admit that I'm no hero...nor do I act like ot think of myself in those terms. But I must admit it is nice to have people thank me and respect the work I do. For some reason, everyone wants to know what I did during 9/11. I just tell them that I don't talk about that part of my life. I just haven't processed it yet even after all these years. 

Anyway, I am rambling now. So, getting back to the main topic, I think the abuse by authority figures angered me to such a degree that it gave me my drive to succeed. I did not want to be the guy being abused or dumped on. I genuinely want to do good and what's right. So, I think that I now feel that I am being ""abused"" by authority figures in the company and it is bringing up all the anger, sadness and emotions of my childhood. I want to get ahead in this company but what I have not yet realized is that no matter how far I go, there will always be someone higher. So, I might as well deal with the situation at hand and not worry so much about what others think of me."
"Took a friend out last night, or so I thought. We agreed that I'd pay for drinks and she'd pay for food. Well, just now, I received a call from her saying that she had the police department on the line and that I'd not paid for the food. I reminded her of our agreement and she denied it existed. She then proceeded to call me a ""scumbag"" and block my number, but not before telling me that I had 24 hours to settle the bill or she'd get the police to press charges. 

Now I don't have (nor have I ever had) too many friends, but this doesn't strike me as the behaviour of a friend, does it?"
"Somewhere in Canada...

Airports are weird. They're the space in between places; non-territories occupied by people in transit, in transition. They don't feel like opportunities though. They feel like the last thing you see before you leave a place forever. I guess that's why they call them terminals. (Ba-dum tssh)

Today, I'm flying for business. The mission: fly out to the middle of bumfuck nowhere, do my job, fly back in a week. Simple right? Yet I can't help feel that this is a prelude, a trial run for some future escape. This job is okay, in the way every 3 month contract is okay, which is to say, it's fun for a season and not a day more. I do shit, I get paid, I get bored, I move on. I don't feel like a traveler because my whole life feels like one long tour, one long jaunt through parts unknown. 

The nerds call it ""deterritorialization"", the process of being cut off from traditional lands, communities, and ways of life. I call it life in 2018. I call it years of decisions and reactions that brought me to this airport. 

Looking forward, I'm sure I'll be back here soon. I'm sick of the city I've adopted, I think I overstayed my welcome. She's fun but she's cold, very cold. The people are cool, too cool for you, too cool for me. I was never cool, is it any wonder I find the climate unbearable?

So where too? I hear Europe is a good destination when you're in your mid 20s with nowhere to go. Or Asia, I hear China is very cyberpunk, could be cool. Or maybe Russia, bleed out whatever communist is left in me. A whole world to explore really.

Or maybe home. Try to convince myself I'm still the same, that the last 6 years never happened. It's not that I failed, it's that I succeeded beyond my wildest dreams: I wanted out, and now I'm out. Now what? Still figuring that one out.

Lorde's ""A World Alone"" is playing in my head, and I'm thinking, maybe all this isn't worth ruminating over anyway. Really it doesn't matter where I go, I am who I am and that itself is enough no matter where I go. The battles of my youth, the homesickness, the alienation, the learning curve, that's all behind me, I am who I became and that can't be undone. All there is left to do is to keep on living. 

My number just came up, time to board. Is this deja vu? Maybe next time. 

We're all travelers really, through space, through time, through each other's lives. If you see me on the road don't be a stranger. After all, a friend is just a stranger you haven't met yet."
"There's a lingering somber feeling every time I'm left to my own devices. 

In 60 seconds, every sound becomes muffled with cotton and my mind becomes an empty expanse. The light from the surface dwindles with negative altitude. 

And the world becomes deathly, excruciatingly calm. 

I'm forced to watch reality from afar. It would seem that my head has plunged me far from the tempest stirred up on the ocean's surface to protect the fragility of my state of mind, like an overbearing parent. Little does it know, the protection is smothering me to death. Don't try and fight to open your senses, it will hurt and destroy you. Don't catch any attention, you might stir something. Don't hold any expectations, you'll be disappointed. Don't leave your hands exposed. Don't play piano again. Don't step outside. Don't smile. Don't love. Don't look. Don't speak. Don't eat. Don't. 

And each time I swim ashore to breathe, I'm briefly tempted with regret. The cycle repeats. 

I hope that I'll reach a lighthouse before I'm buried by my own cowardice. "
"I met a guy in Colorado
Haven't asked his age. I recently moved here with my cousin. I'm originally from Tennessee. 

He's very fit. Tall. Dirty blonde hair and blue eyes. I see him every morning when I walk on the trail by the mountain. He comes over too, since he's a friend of my cousin's husband. I've caught him eyeing me. As if he were onto me. He gives me a very warm and delicate smile. Those piercing blue eyes, very captivating. 

It's as if he were trying to woo me. With that smile, that look. No words have been exchanged among us. But those looks speak a thousand words.


Sounds nice and all but thing is, I have a boyfriend back in Tennessee. I'm very much in love with him. Though things between us are always on the edge. Wish he were more closer to me. We barely speak. I moved to Colorado to better my mental health after catching my bf cheating on me. It's been a very rough journey and I felt like I needed time away from all that pain.

Hence why I now live in Colorado.
But, why is this mysterious new guy appearing in me life? He really is a nice guy but he's not the guy that makes my heart race. He's very sweet, charming and very dedicated to everything. Sounds like a really nice man.

Truly, even as good as it might sound, what I really want is for my boyfriend to be more attentive and loving. I just want things between us to better. But I cant heal if he's still hurting me. I cant heal at all. 

Theres this new man here and my heart tells me I should leave that pain and try something new but I dont want to. I dont wanna leave my boyfriend behind and start something with a guy I dont have feelings for. This new guy seems highly interested in me.

I wish.. my boyfriend seemed that interested in me too. Maybe that's why I was captivated by this new guy. My heart has seemed to forgotten what it felt like to be chased after, to feel truly loved and wanted and not feel like a bother or a second choice. 

I'm fighting hard to better myself and proceed with my life in TN with my boyfriend. But honestly I dont feel like he's fighting for me. 

I just want... things to go back to how they once were. Not having the feeling of ""he's cheating on me again"" 

How I wish... my love didnt hurt"
"Yesterday I only ate one meal. Went to sleep on an empty stomach.

Today, I'll go to sleep with an empty stomach again. Only ate once this morning. 

I've lost motivation to do anything at all. My mind wont let me think straight. I just wanna lay in bed all day and cry. Suicide is all over my mind yet I dont dare to do so. Pages of suicide methods scattered all over my journal to never be acted upon. Why do I keep drawing/writing them out? I dont even know.

I'm tired of this empty feeling. Soon enough I'll become numb to everything. I'm losing myself. 

When will this sadness end? Will I ever feel loved? 

I know that one day, I'll be abandoned. Then, it will be the end of me. "
"If you move to (in my case) Brussels speaking neither Dutch, French, English, or German, you will be unable to work. If you're going to come in hijab, you'll probably end up going to a mosque to find a culture you recognize. Neither of my wives were educated, so no one would hire them. So, their world became a Guujrati-dialect speaking subculture. As they got more religious, they wanted to have me become more religious. I didn't care for their subculture, as I do speak Dutch, French, English, and German, along with the Gujrati dialect of my family."
"On Saturday I did something I didn't really want to do.  I went to a happy hour for my friend's going away.  My initial reaction when invited was to make up a reason to bail, but I wound up going anyway.  I wish I didn't.  It was just overpriced food, people getting drunk, and me wishing I didn't have to spend the money I spent.  I am much happier out in nature or at a friend's house.  Overall, I'm glad I had the experience because it taught me to listen to my instincts.  I was invited on a trip I knew would not be good for me but felt pressure to attend.  I turned it down today and I feel really good about that choice.

Sunday was spent lazing about, eating delicious food, and having a fun sexual encounter with my husband.  We had sex on Friday too.  I don't know what has gotten into me, but I like it.  I even initiated it yesterday just by fondling him.  That progressed into a long, slow blow job with him watching porn. Then I did something I've never done before.  I asked him if he would ever like to watch me fuck another girl.  It was clear this made him squirm, as he didn't know what to say.  It turned him on even more though.  It turned me on too.  It will probably never happen in real life, but I got a kick out of bringing up at that moment. It felt so, so good to be that into it.  That ready.  It has been a while since I have felt that way.  Perhaps that is why I have such a spring in my step today.

Today I woke up groggy and went to the gym, cleaned the house, took him to school, and played on the computer.  I didn't do anything different, but my attitude has been wonderful today.  I just feel content.  Like everything is ok.  My life is ok the way it is.  So I'm not some crazy successful person.  At least I don't feel stressed out. I enjoy my life. It is wonderful to get glimpses of what feeling satisfied feels like.  Most of the time I am so hard on myself for not ""doing more"" that I cannot enjoy the freedom I've been given.  Today, I enjoyed it.  I hope I enjoy many more days to come."
"Feeling stagnant.  I woke up groggy after a night full of storms.  I didn't want to get up, so I laid in bed and listened to the rain.  Eventually, I got up and got busy.  I am a stay at home wife.  Some days I love it because I get to be exactly as lazy as I want so long as I get the chores done first.  Other days I feel like I'm wasting the potential I once had.  

I volunteered at the shelter today.  My plan was to play with the dogs in their kennels instead of walking the because of the lightning storm.  Instead, I was pulled into taking photos.  The photographer was not the nicest person I have ever met and the session didn't go well.  I felt his frustration with me.  On the drive home I replayed the photo session and felt inadequate.  I clearly wasn't doing what he wanted me to do.  I began thinking I couldn't make it in the working world.  Or maybe I just don't want to? At least the puppies are always happy to see me and thankful for my time.

I spent the next hour taking my 'lunch break'.  I watched a show and ate.  Now I'm fighting inertia to get up and so something... anything.. else.  I'll have to pick up my husband soon.  I feel like I struggle to push myself to do more than the bare minimum.  My husband is 100% happy with what I do.  Our house is clean, we always have homemade food, I take care of the errands, and I take care of my body. Is this enough for me?  Can I be happy with this simple life?  I really wish I knew the answer to that.  I don't think I've ever been completely happy.  I wonder if I am depressed.  Is there such a thing as low-level depression where you can still get stuff done but generally have a low mood? I wish I could fix it.  I just want to feel sure and safe and ok.  Like I am enough and this is enough.  Maybe if I start meditating again it will help.  Maybe it will help with all this grasping and questioning.  If I stop grasping, is that giving up?  So many questions.  Not enough answers.  

I wish I could be one of those bright, shiny, happy people.  Instead, I am this quiet, melancholy woman who feels a little unkempt and uneasy in most situations.  

Life is confusing.

"I got curious about the finances of Donald Trump's digital campaign contractor, Cambridge Analytica, this morning. So, I got the source data from Crunchbase, cleaned them up, and put it into R. 

They closed $353,664,433 of funding **this month** alone from 16 different investors, the lion's share from Beijing-based [ofo](https://www.ofo.com/), a bike-sharing startup. 

Based on the data, the company started raising funds in February of this year.

"Yesterday and the night before I was feeling really down. I kept thinking of things I did in the past, embarrassing things that just made me [cringe](https://pics.me.me/do-you-have-those-memories-that-are-really-cringey-and-4337849.png) as if it were happening all over again. These thoughts are typical, not just for me, but [I know everyone recognizes this.](https://i.imgflip.com/1vfgb9.jpg) I just wish I knew how to turn it off. It was strange. I just sat around the house watching tv shows that made me even more emotional. I didn't do anything that might have helped me feel better. I didn't do any journalling, I didn't try to work through why I was feeling the way I felt. I just wanted to drown it out or forget it. I really wanted to play minecraft, but my main computer is down, and unless I want to play it without mods it just won't work out on my laptop. It's a good thing I couldn't play though. I get way to obsessed and just spend hours and hours playing to the point it affects my health. I should have gotten up and done something yesterday. 

Today I feel a lot better emotionally. I did some house cleaning and some exercise. Valentines day is tomorrow! I told my husband not to worry about getting us anything because I was  buying us some Darn Tough Socks for Valentines day. I thought that would be a lot more practical. We'll probably go out to eat as well. Looking forward to spending some of the day with him. Hoping we get some time to watch our shows together and have popcorn.

**Gratitude**: I am grateful for the low-key way my husband and I deal with Valentines day. There seems to be so much stress related to the holiday and I'm glad we aren't apart of it. I alm also grateful for comfortable chairs at work. Really grateful my daughter could finally get involved in Girl Scouts. I think that will really be good for her."
"I wish I could give a shit about most things right now, but I don't. All that feels good to me right now is sitting home to watch the Olympics, eating bad food, and thinking about you. I think you'd probably be the only thing that would be able to get me out of here. I know that I won't hear from you, so it means I'll be staying here. And that's fine. 

The February blues have taken over. "
".......... What am I doing here? I felt an impulse, a motivation to write my thoughts down in either a fictional or truthful manner. I first browsed the wonders of r/WritingPrompts, but nothing sparked my interest. I kept searching, clicking through links and pages like a scavenger hunt. Until I happened upon this. I created a new account to stay anonymous, read the rules carefully (Don't worry mods ;P) then opened a new entry. My search was over, but for what purpose did it begin? 

In my bag I carry a small notebook, a notebook kept for the purpose of collecting my thoughts and being able to understand them clearly. And for someone who overthinks basically every tiny detail in their lives, it has become quite helpful. But thoughts are never truths without confirmation. I can write for ages in a personally-kept secret, and I plan on continuing to do so. But the urge to share is immensely strong in this day and age, and I'm just another victim. I've been quite separated luckily from social media; I lost that sense of joy from posting new pictures on Instagram, or sharing that I went to get ice cream today on Facebook. I never bothered much with Twitter, no particular reason other than an almost daunting feeling that I get from the concept. But as I grow older and learn so much more about myself, one personal truth that I have found is that I absolutely love to tell stories.

I have been told I am a man of context, which from my understanding means that if I am telling a story, I must explain the beginning, middle, and end completely or else I feel I didn't give the account it's justice. That proceeds a problem. No one wants to hear an hour long story out-of-the-blue. Most people in my generation demand speed, the quicker they get to the end the better. So in fear that my tales would feel sour by the end because people just did not have the patience to listen to the whole thing, I often keep to myself. And I am not separate from those people, I still struggle myself to sit through a long explanation that someone is providing me. So I certainly do not blame them. I suppose even the length of this posting as it stands now already feels like far too much effort to read, and maybe this audience would feel the same impatience. Again, I don't blame you. But I wanted to start. Begin in some way. 

Now that the first steps are done, I have no idea if I'll even continue. Maybe I'll feel a large sense of satisfaction just from writing this narrative, then never revisit the concept. I suppose we will see.

"I was just about to sit down and write my assignment concerning what integrity means to me when someone knocked at my door. It was a woman and she told me she had just gotten into a fight with her husband and she thought her arm was broken. Her arm did indeed look pretty rough. I just got back from driving her to the hospital.  I am feeling sad as my first gut instinct was not to trust this woman, I thought someone might be waiting nearby to barge into my home or even when I got back from the hospital I'd find my house ransacked. When I came home I checked every room to make sure someone wasn't hiding inside. I feel guilty for feeling this way, and also a little angry at this world because I feel this way.  Maybe I'm paranoid or just the right amount of paranoid, but I weighed how I'd feel if I turned this woman away vs how I'd feel if I was robbed. Then I just hoped.  

To the woman I'm so sorry  if you witnessed any of my suspicion, I tried my best to hide it from you, you didn't need it especially after what you went through.  I will be thinking of you, and I hope the next we meet it will be under better circumstances.


Gratitude: I am thankful I had the opportunity to be useful to someone today. Tied to this I am thankful I happened to be home to help her and that I could be someone willing to listen to her. 
I am also thankful for mostly reliable transportation and the ease of communication."
"Dear Reader,

I'm finding myself struggling again to find food and shelter. At least this time I'm not alone. I've been homeless with my partner and my dog since June. We've had many good days, but also lots of bad. We've bounced around places between a span of roughly 400 miles in our state. We've been way up North and down South on the border of the neighboring state. We're currently near the Mid-Coast region. Things aren't very good, though. We've been given a hotel voucher from the local Homeless Coalition, but tonight is our last night. I'm worried for the future. I'm not sure what we are going to do. However, I'm doing my best to stay positive. Things are tough, but I'm okay. I've been taking my medications more regularly. I'm doing better mental-health-wise. It's almost dinner time, though, and I'm so hungry.. I wish I had money, or food. I'm honest to Goddess trying so hard to do good. I started school on the 30th of October. I had my first day of work today. It just all seems so hopeless right now, though. I don't think it is, but it seems it. I'm trying to sell my art, as well, but no one wants to commission me. Oh well, maybe I'm asking too much of people.

Regardless, it is time for me to go. I'm almost out of data.

Best wishes, Reader.

With all sincerity,

-R"
"Dear DiaryofaRedditor....
I feel like people are disappointing me in all directions. One friend couldn't even let me know when tentative plans were definitely not happening. And when confronted... she became defensive and attacked me instead. She thought because she offers something free that she gets a free pass in basic communication. I just wanted a quick apology. But she couldn't even manage it. She saw nothing wrong with her thoughtlessness.
The dating world... is just a huge disappointment. I mean, that's expected. Hopefully one day I will meet the right one for a long term relationship. But these are a bunch of strangers so disappointment is expected.
Work is alright and a bit stressful sometimes, while other times it is a complete bore. I could literally get up, go to a movie, come back and no one would notice. Other days, the ones I like, are very demanding but spike my anxiety.
My dreams have been intense lately - the nyquil isn't helping with that (I've had a cold). Intense dreams have always had anxiety underlying in the dream for me. My mother's death in one; my ex-husband being abusive to his new wife in the second dream; and me screaming at work to be heard by my boss (in real life my boss is awesome). Dreams have always helped guide me in understanding myself and right now I really have to focus on what these mean.
I am thankful though for many things. I am making new friends in the city. I have family that is always there for me when I need it. My sisters put up with me because they know me well enough to understand me. My niece... she's 5. I fully believe that everything I am going through is for her. I will one day be there for her in these situations and can help her get through them.
Thank you for anyone that is listening. Writing this out really does help."
"The 4th of July was spent emailing back and forth with Bill, I don't know why, and then around 3 pm I went to his place, I took my youngest. 

We smoked and talked, and cried and hugged and argued and cried. He had to shoot a show that night, something he does every year. This year he asked if I wanted to come. He has never asked me to come let alone let me. 

I went and helped him set up and shoot the show, he came home with me that night and stayed. Earlier in the day we had agreed we wouldn't have sex for awhile because we were both so wounded by it. When things got heated I said something about it and he said ""I'm your husband, it doesn't matter"". It mattered to me, but I went ahead with it. It's always best with him. 

We both had the 5th off so we slept in, lounged with the kids, and then went to dinner, after that Walmart for some things. It was a really good day. 

As soon as we got home he picked a fight about the restraining order. It went on for hours until he finally left. But then I found out he didn't really leave like he said he did. He just sat outside. And when I went out in the dark for a smoke I stepped on him... 

He asked if he could just stay again and I said no. I knew we would just fight all night. We didn't talk all day the 6th. Just silence, until I texted him. I asked if he was trying to sign into my Gmail. I got 2 google verification codes. He said no I said ok, He asked how my day was, I told him and asked how his was. 

Mundane, fake, waste of time bullshit, and then he exploded again. Again handing me the ultimatum of lifting the restraining order. I refused. I sought counsel with my sister and brother, two of the Godliest people I know, both say it is a bad idea, I sought counsel with someone who has lived through something similar to this and she gave me a panicked no as well. I don't feel any conviction to lift it. He is dangerous and I need the option to protect myself. 

It is more of the same this morning. He has told me to stop talking to him over and over but when I stop responding he get even more furious. I am going to just opt for silence again. At least when I wasn't responding and reading what he was saying I didn't feel like I was dying inside. 

Jake, the 22 year old is still floating around, calling. I went through my camera's pics from the last 2 weeks and saw some of us, ones I had taken of him and ones he had taken of me. He is fucked up, but I had fun with him. They made me smile. Still... I must remain silent. 

I still feel as if i am dying inside. Dying from the inside out, as if I laid down to rest in a quiet dark place I may not rise. I may die of heart break. I am in an ocean of pain and I feel like I can't come up for air. I am so tired I could weep. Again. 

I need someone to take over for me. I don't know how long I can continue to do my life at the capacity I am doing it. I am so spent and there is too much, forever looming over me, and I. Am. Tired. 
I am broken. "
"Dear diarists,

I'm a habitual Microsoft Notepad user, so this will be a change for me. Anyway, moving right along. 

I've experienced a lot of life changes since October. I've lost a lot, and gained a lot. Normally, I love change. The thrill, the uncertainty, running headlong into the unknown. I've been moving in and out of different states since I was about 20, at first just to get away, but then to become more a man of the world than any one place. I grew up in the bubble of bubbles: Orange County, California. To those I know personally, it's no secret that I loath that town. Everyone is so busy being slow, and largely ignoring the rest of the world, as if it doesn't matter. 

Well, I made the move back here, after 5 years. 5 terribly short, unwisely spent years being a much better me than I ever was here - even now. I lost a lot all around the same time in my last town. Lost my full time position that I had been working towards for a solid year because somebody knew a guy. Lost my relationship that had kept me going for 4 and a half years. I was losing my family back in California, because I had distanced myself so much for a myriad of reasons. And finally, I feared I had started to lose my mind. 

In my travels, I have experienced many things, met many people, and tried on many new philosophies. My appetite for worldly experience was insatiable. I fear now that this was as selfish a position as any could be. I would overindulge in party favors, go into work stoned, and refused to take any real advice, being young and certain that I was on the right path. In reality, I was just happy to be as far from my family and California as I could be at the time. In fact, the first time I moved out of the state was clear across the country to New York City. Culture shock meant nothing to me until that move. But homesickness never knocked on my door. Home to me was wherever I could freely be myself, not necessarily wherever I was from. I had unconsciously fetishized escapism.

For a very long time, I've felt that something is wrong with me. Something unknown, or perhaps unknowable. In fact, I only recently learned that I've been experiencing anxiety attacks that almost shut down my body, and nearly always do my mind. I completely withdraw into my head and let my body take me through the motions. Responding to people with very basic, short sentences, and never speaking on my own. I had honestly thought I was just shivering for no reason, or that maybe I had just gotten too high or needed some water. Never once did it occur to me that something was actually happening there. Which, in retrospect, is a huge lapse in judgement on my part. The irony here is that I prize personal strength and willpower. I am a mind over matter kind of man, but lacked the mind to see I had been succumbing to my own for years. 

Backing up a few years. Myself and some friends were hanging out at their house, and we had planned on trying mushrooms. I had never done them before but was certain that, whatever it was, I could take it. It's like saying you can handle your booze without ever having been drunk before. You just don't have a concept of what that state of mind is like until you've been in it. This night fundamentally changed me forever.

I spent the night looking in every conceivable direction to maybe take a break from everything I was seeing. Even closing my eyes didn't help because the light behind my eyelids would dance and take shape. This was the beginning of the end. From here, I spun off into a thought loop that wouldn't loosen it's grip on my psyche for years. I felt like I had forgotten something - something important. I looked and I asked, and I couldn't find whatever it was. Then I noticed something. I has forgotten what I was searching for. Then I had forgotten what was driving me to search for something, and ultimately felt I was losing everything. I eventually lost all traces of time, self, and position. I was shaved down to nothing, and snapped. I don't remember all of it, which gives me *some* comfort; I do remember eventually making my way into my bedroom for the night, where I spent what felt like an eternity going in and out of weeping and laughing, at nothing and to myself. I hallucinated voices saying they don't know how this happened, and that they never meant to break me. One voice rang out, ""How will I tell his parents what I've done?"" At the time, all I knew was that they were all talking about me, and I couldn't figure out how to put back all the pieces that shattered.

A shard of me was lucid enough to ponder what was going to happen. I had resigned myself to being in this state of mind forever. I eventually passed out, having not totally come out of that. I had left my phone in the bedroom earlier in the night before anything started, and something brought my attention to it. That's when I saw a picture of my then girlfriend and I, which I had set as the lock screen photo. I stared for a moment because I knew I recognized these people, and after a little bit of time, reality began to set in again, at least as far as it could. I remembered that goofy guy was me, and that pretty girl was my girlfriend, although her name took a little longer to recover. I stared at the screen for a long time, constantly turning it back on instead of unlocking it.

I never fully recovered from that night, I don't think. I'm scared of my own mind; a prisoner in a jail with no keys, and bars that close in tighter and tighter. I fear I've lost grip, and tremble as I watch little parts of me melt away with each episode. I've started to worry about latent mental conditions, and the possibility of undiagnosed autism, or worse yet, potential brain damage from that night, or one of the others. It's gotten to the boiling point now, where I've started seeking professional help, and have emailed several centers for brain health, autism, and depression. 

These little notes, these journal entries; I've always just used them as a way to think manually. Everything is such a convoluted mess upstairs that just thinking alone is too much to handle. Without the focus of a keyboard or pencil, I can't very well articulate myself anymore. So, now that I'm taking a more proactive stance against these feelings, I feel it's both advantageous, and helpful, to me, to share the story as it develops. It'll give me a place to sharpen my thoughts, and might end up being a pretty good story one day.

Well, that's about all I've got to share at the moment. I'll be back soon, with a shorter, hopefully more cheery entry. I would also like to clarify that this is an outlet for me to think, and that maybe someone would like reading through it. This is not a weak ploy for help. Contrary to how this sounds, I actually do have people that care about me and are helping me at the moment. 

Keep it real, Diarists"
"My laptop screen hinge broke today. Again. I brought it to the shop and the technician said it broke in a different place this time.

This isn't the best time to be without a laptop because I've suddenly found myself inundated with work. I build websites for a living and my laptop is my money-maker. The technician said repairing the hinge will cost $100 and take 3-4 days. Replacing it will cost more and I'll have to wait for the part to ship.

There's a silver-lining to this dark cloud of mine: had I kept using my laptop I could have cracked the LCD screen which, according to the technician, has happened to some particularly stubborn customers. So that's something to be thankful for. Even so, it was just before closing time so I left my laptop with the technician and he said he'd get back to me with options and pricing in the morning.

I'm not completely without a laptop. I still have my old one that's surprisingly survived the desktop I'd bought after it. The processor is unfortunately slow by today's standards and as time goes by applications & websites become even more insatiable forcing my processor to climb ever steeper hills.

After leaving the shop I opted to site at a cafe and have some chocolate cake. I needed to deal with the stress somehow.

I spent the evening catching up on work using my ageing laptop. There's... a lot to be done. Let's have a good nights sleep and come back fresh in the morning."
"I woke up on the wrong side of bed this morning. Wasn't feeling like getting out, actually called in sick. 

Kissed the wife good bye, but out of duty, not because I wanted to. 

Realised that I didn't have food for lunch and didn't want to go anywhere, so I had leftover garlic bread from the last time we had pizza delivered. 

After lunch, I went into work and got a few things done that I've been meaning to get sorted for a little bit. 

I had to vet a equity-only purchase agreement -- yes, one of the behemoths in industry wants to buy one of our investees. I wasn't expecting this to manifest itself into reality today.

Another investee fixed their last few bugs and will be going live by the weekend. 

My beloved Newcastle United won promotion to the Premier League. 

I just got home, saw an episode of spooks and write this. My day was like the most recent *classico*, it was a day of two halves."
"You reach the point where your whole body starts to ache and the exhaustion sets in. You did nothing all day, but your mind feels cluttered with thoughts and pain. That's how I feel right now, amongst other things.

My mind is cluttered with the thoughts of you, and how I am certain it was fate that brought us together. It was no coincidence for me to meet you that day, because there is something bigger about to happen here. No matter what anybody else thinks."
"I sent the message. And maybe it's Hollywood's influence but I thought I'd feel something more than this, the sweet taste of victory after finishing a difficult task or a lightness signifying the release of a weight.

It wasn't easy to send the message. I'd contemplated sending it for months and even thought about what I'd put in it. But when it came time, there was no fanfare, no internal heaviness that drew me to send it, no harps playing when I did. It was like sending any other message over the phone or through email. Just another set of 1s and 0s penetrating the digital ether.

I sent the message. And I'm slightly proud of myself for that."
"I was supposed to see you yesterday. I specifically waited an extra long time just so I would have the opportunity to spend some time with you. And then I showed up, and you weren't there. With no response or apologies given. I was crushed, and I still am. I need to see you. And soon."
"I was laid off work in June. This morning, I got hired by a startup in the Bay Area -- I'm in Los Angeles. They're covering relocation and giving me a signing bonus. I'm really, really excited! YIPPEE!"
"I feel like I made my life more complicated trying to seek out a actual relationship. Should have just continued with my FWB. At least he was honest about the deal. Or maybe I should just invest in some high quality sex toys. They can't lie to you. 2016 has been the worst dating wise so farT-T 
 On a brighter note my succulent is so adorable in the window . Cutest plant ever. Also it's amazing how a good pair of jeans can make your butt look 10 times better. I'm gonna look at the positives this week haha 
"
"Alright, so i'm getting surgery in like, 2 hours and I'm about to leave. Hopefully everything goes smoothly as I'm getting the tendons in 3 of my toes on each foot sliced length-wise to fix my claw toe. Can't wait to have this fixed as my feet hurt to walk right now.

Wish me luck!"
"I had my individual counseling session with the marriage counselor today. She wanted to know more about the incidents of physical abuse, so I told her about the two instances where my husband has choked me. Apparently, choking is its own category of abuse or something like that. Basically, when someone chokes you it is a serious offense. It isn't like when someone hits you, you could at least defend yourself and curl into the fetal position or hit them back. But choking is different. Obviously, I never thought about it before, but it makes sense. Just squeezing a person's neck for one second too long could be the difference between life or death. She was very adamant on me understanding how serious choking someone was. She kept telling me that she isn't trying to scare me, but I need to know that my situation is serious. 

I'm just dumbfounded I guess. She said that every unsolicited thing that I was saying was textbook. Fucking textbook. It's hard to hear how a situation that I am in is so common and so well studied that the outcome is already known. How often have you imagined that one day your spouse is going to kill you? Probably never, but you hear about it in the news all the time. No one ever thinks it will happen to them. I never thought that I would be in a relationship like this. I never thought that my husband would choke me. I was stupid enough to think he wouldn't do it again. Will there be a third? Statistics say yes. Statistics also say that I am at a higher risk of dying from him choking me because he has choked me in the past.

I told her that I know better. I told her that I have given friends in similar situations advice and I always tell them to leave, but here I am. I am disappointed in myself because I won't take my own advice. But it isn't that easy. If I could just get up and leave I fucking would have. But I have to think about the kids. He doesn't hurt them. I don't want them to hate me because I broke up the family. (I know it isn't my fault, and I am sure the kids would grow up to understand, but as a parent in this situation you do think you are making the right choices with the best interest of your children and it isn't until later you realize that you were wrong.) I have no money. I gave up my job to stay home and raise the children. He works. He pays the bills. I'm not educated. I've been going to school on and off for six fucking years trying to earn my degree and I can't. I have no friends or family here. It's a military town. People come and go all the time. They keep to themselves. I've reached out to my family before, and they were completely unsupportive. They didn't care, why would they care now? So what can I do? I sit here, and I pray to whatever god that will listen and I tell him thanks for letting me live to see another day, thank you for protecting children, but please give me the strength to leave. I want out, but I'm afraid to take that first step because I have nothing. Nothing but ten years wasted on some asshole who is completely in disbelief that he is some bad guy.
"
"/u/tomachiB I see you are back, too. I haven't read your post yet, I hope to read good things for you.

It's been awhile, that's for sure. Bill and I separated again. It happened two weeks ago this coming Thursday. I can't get past it again. Him and Skank. I just can't do it. I am so sickened by it. I just can't get over it again. 

I am still going to counseling, I am learning so much. I have learned how to speak my truth, and speaking it has revealed things to me that I didn't even know about myself. Then, I speak that truth and I find more. I feel excited about learning how to discover this... but what I am discovering is so sad, the life I have lived is so fucking sad. All of it, from the day I was born, it was sad. 

I learned that when I feel like I want to kill myself that it is because when a person is experiencing trauma, emotional or physical, their brains refer back to their child brains, if your child brain was unhappy and miserable and felt like it wanted to die then, then as an adult, a person will also feel suicidal. 

I have wished I wasn't born for as long as I remember, the day I stopped wishing I wasn't born was the day I started wishing to kill myself. How fucking sad is that? 

I don't really know where to pick up from there, because despite me feeling slightly upbeat tonight I just killed it for myself. What ever, I am learning. 

Bill hasn't been so awful about the separation this time. Sort of, the harassment has been less, he didn't steal money from me. There has been less name calling, less telling me that I hate him. I guess it's because this time I have actual ""grounds"" for not wanting to not be with him. Skank saves the day. (can I please just throw up already)

So, this time has been different for me as well, learning to speak my truth, and knowing that fear is running my show, means that I am able to see I am about to do something motivated by fear, or I am able to see that I am not speaking my truth and make a decision to speak it. 

It has made the lines clearer, for me any way. Bill asked me tonight if he could come in the morning and get in bed with me. So... I'll explain how those lines got murky in a minute. 

I guess I should start with this past Friday night. I went to the bar. I don't do that, I think I have said before. I just don't. I never really understood it, I was never included in the fun when I had gone with Bill. But I wanted to drink, and I didn't want to do it alone, and all three boys were at friends houses. 

I sat at the very end away from everyone, I drink captain and coke. Three drinks and 45 minutes later a girl named... wait, no real names, ok T. T walked up and introduced herself. She was shorter, larger breasted but not fat, with long curly hair. Her eyes were already too squinty to tell what color they were. I have no idea why I remember all those details. She was with her ""wifey"" and her boyfriend. I sat with T and wifey and we had some good laughs. It was nice to get loose and talk to some adults and not about the disaster my life was. 

Boyfriend was playing pool at the other end of the bar, small town mind you so there was all of six people in the whole place. Boyfriend decided he needed a smoke, I guess, and T and wifey followed him out leaving me on my own again. I ordered my 5th drink and sat back. 

Out of the corner of my eye I saw someone, directly behind my chair, he was tall, and larger, like a man, not small like Bill. He was well groomed and had strawberry blonde, almost red hair. His eyes were super green, and he was smiling down at me, with probably the most adorable shy grin I have ever seen. I couldn't help but smile back, mostly to myself since I could only just see him out of the corner of my eye, but still, it was cute. I can't really describe it. I felt him put his hand on the back of my chair and I could feel him move, I knew he was trying to figure out what to say. 

Its a small town, I have been here for more than 7 years and almost no one knows who I am. So, when he finally said said something he said, ""Where did you come from?"" I laughed and told him I lived here. Surprise, he, of course, like everyone else had been here his whole life, they can never figure out how there is someone here that they don't know. 

His name was Cody. He was adorable. He went back to his pool game when boyfriend came back in, so the conversation was short. I went back to T and wifey and laughing. He reappeared to order a drink, even though the bar and the bar tenders work on both sides of the bar, I felt him behind me and could see him looking at me in that way again. He was obviously smitten and it was adorable. 

We talked some more, then decided to go out and smoke ourselves. He never stopped looking at me like that. Every time he looked at me he got that silly shy grin on his face. A couple drags in and wifey joined us. She knew Cody well and easily took the conversation over. I didn't mind, it gave me a chance to take a good look at him, to watch his face and the way it was when he wasn't looking at me. To see how he was built. I liked it. T and boyfriend came out, I mentioned to boyfriend that my Colorado friend had kicked his ass in pool Easter weekend, T got mad and went back in. Ooops, apparently that was a bad night. 

Things start getting fuzzy for me here. Cody and I talked a lot more, I ran out of money at the same time he did, he wanted to go to the ATM, we sat out and had a smoke while we chatted about it, I mentioned an issue with drinking and driving, which he was about to do. We talked about why he did it and it got deep, cause even drunk I am learning to say what I really think instead of the ""right thing"". It ended with me saying ""So you don't care about yourself then?"" He hung his head for a second, and looked back up at me, and his face went into an even bigger grin. I told him I was sorry for going that deep. He shrugged his shoulders and said you're right, lets walk. He took my hand and off we went.

The ATM was only a block and a half away, we held hands the whole way, I don't remember what we talked about, we walked slow, kids, relationships, pets, jobs. He pulled out his cash and took my hand again as we walked back. Before we rounded the building I backed up against it, gently pulling him with me. I wanted to know what he tasted like. 

He tasted good. But I remember he felt better. He kissed me slowly and gently, he was so gentle about it, even when I felt him going deeper and when we were taking more of each other he was tender about it. 

It took my breath away, we parted, smiled at each other and rounded the corner. The bar had gained a few more people in our absence. The ones I remember were both Mexican, they had taken up residence in my corner of the bar. They had a drink waiting for me. One was much older, and one likely younger than I. Both tried to flirt, but Cody was on the other side of me. Occasionally squeezing my leg, touching my hand, reminding me he was there. He kissed me once, in front of the rest of them, unashamed.

The bar closed, Cody had to drive someone home, he asked for my number and I gave it to him. He begged me let him give me a ride. I insisted I would walk. The older Mexican man decided to walk with me. As we walked he tried to grab my hand, Ew, asked me to come back to his restaurant and drink with him more. Ew. 

And then my phone rang. It was Cody. ""Where are you?"" he wanted to know. I told him I wasn't sure, because I was actually not paying attention to how far I had walked. I hurried ahead of Old Mexican Man and looked at the street signs, I told him where I was and asked if he would come get me and save me from the other guy. 

It was all in good fun. We had a good giggle about it while he drove the few blocks to get me. I jumped up into his truck and he got out and let the Old Mexican Man get in the back. We took him to his place and then he took me to mine. 

I don't remember going in, I just remember kissing him. We made it all the way to the bedroom, I have a king sized bed, It takes up most of the room, our drunk asses still managed to fall onto the floor. It was hilarious. 

It was amazing. I am into things, things that not all guys are down for, and I was good and drunk and I forget my manners. He experienced a lot of things that he hadn't ever experienced before. He was amazing through all of it. We took a break at one point and I got up to get us some water. I went upstairs to turn a light off in the boys room and fell all the way back down. Completely naked, still drunk, and I hurt myself. My ankle hurt so bad I couldn't stand up. Cody heard it, came and literally picked me up off the floor like it was nothing and carried me back to bed... where he spent more time on me than any man has ever spent on me before. 

But let me go back to that real quick. Dude carried me. I mean, I'm light enough to be carried, sure. But no one has ever done that. He was so gentle and fluid about it, and he was still looking at me like that, only I was 6 feet off the ground in this man's arms completely naked. It was one of the most tender experiences I have ever had in my entire life. Can I remind you this man is a STRANGER!

And then after... he took care of me like no man has, I have never been so completely and totally satisfied. So buzzed, soooo electric. And then I took care of him and he made it sound like he had never had anything better in his entire life. He took the time to tell me how good it was and to really appreciate it. Cody if you ever come across this, Thank you for that. 

I work hard to please a man. He appreciated it. At 6:30 in the morning we noticed the light coming through the windows. It was past dawn. I told him what time it was and he told me he had to be at work at 8:30. I set an alarm for an hour and we slept wrapped in each other. Then I woke him and sent him away.

I sighed a sigh, I can still feel the way it felt. 

And then...

I looked at my phone. 20 missed calls and 40 messages from Bill. He had driven by the house and seen the truck in the driveway. 

This is already insanely long so I won't go into details. He knew, I didn't even try to deny it and honestly I really didn't feel bad.. I still don't. I don't want to be with him anymore. I made it clear as clear can be. I can't be with him. I even suggested he maybe try to make a go of it with Skank. I was clear. 

So I don't feel bad, and I would do it again. I put my phone on silent and went back to sleep. 

I woke up hours later, still feeling good and found a friend request from Cody, he had found me. My heart smiled. It meant that it wasn't nothing to him in my mind. 

Later he confirmed it by texting me. We have talked everyday since. Short conversations, but he is still checking in. He's asking questions and getting to know me. I am finding that I quite like him... The worst part about all of this is I know I'm not ready, I know I shouldn't. I know it will end badly. 

Plus there is Mike... who I'll admit that I have slept with twice since Bill and I separated. I'm being a slut. I know its because I equate being loved with sex and sexual touch. I know why I'm doing it. I'm just not sure I am ready to stop, cause its the only time I don't feel like dying. God that is fucking sad too. See still learning. 

Anyway... There is a ton more to tell, but this is so long, and I can put more in later. 

It's good to be back Reddit Diary.

"I'm just ready for the pain to stop. But life is painful I guess. It has its fleeting moments of  happiness but those seem to get snatched away pretty quickly. Death and heartbreak have not been strangers in my life. I wonder if it's possible to run out of tears. I don't think I'll ever off myself but some days when I wake I desperately search the depths of my brain trying to figure how the hell I'm going to make it through another day. I think I keep at it for my mom. She's been through enough already. 

I've always been a sad girl. When I met him it was the start of the year and I felt like I was turning over a new leaf. But after how things turned out, I wish I had never met him. Nothing worse than feeling safe and appreciated and then getting your heart smashed into a million pieces. I wish I had just stayed home that night and watched TV or went to sleep. It would have saved me months of turmoil. 

Tomorrow is gonna be a rough day. But I think I've perfected my happy face so I think I'll be OK. "
"Love is such a fickle thing. It can make you feel like you're on top of the world, like you can do anything. It can make you feel that things like happiness and joy and bliss last forever. It can distort your vision and make you believe anything you want to believe. It can make you see things that aren't really there. And when time reveals that things you once thought you saw really weren't, love rears its ugly head and tears you to pieces. You swear to yourself that you'll never fall in love again, but then, inevitably, you do, hoping and praying the cycle won't repeat itself. 

But it does. It always does. Or maybe I'm just jaded. "
"Dear Reddit,

Today on our way to the job a new coworker of mine was talking about Survivor. It made me feel really bad because it reminded me of Stephanie. I know that I used to remark about how funny it was for such an incredibly smart girl to enjoy movies like 'white girls' or 'the hot chick' and then return to doing her PhD afterwards. I didn't mean ""funny"" with a negative connotation, it was comforting for me in a way. I just liked to point it out. When Chris brought up Survivor I remembered discovering that Stephanie had been watching every week and keeping it from me for fear that I would tease her. I think my reaction was of disbelief that she wouldn't tell me, and I even ended up watching it with her and asking about all of the characters.

&nbsp;

I told that story and then zoned out trying to recall my behaviour at the time. I can't remember being abrasive about it, to me it was jovial but I obviously did something to make her feel self-conscious. I was glad she liked dumb things, afterall I am a dumb thing myself. I listened to a TED talk about vulnerability after work and it tied right in for me. Most people are conditioned to hide vulnerabilities in the fear that it makes them weak. The 'talker' believed the opposite, being vulnerable opens you up to situations in which your resiliance and true self is showcased. Opening yourself up that way is how the deepest connections are made, and Stephanie was hiding her like of reality tv. It was a small side of her, but that's not the point - I wanted to know this stuff. I hid bigger things, worrying that they weren't favorable. There are many things about our relationship that I have picked up on and am working to adjust but this one, while I feel bad about it thinking back, I dunno. I wasn't vocally supportive or encouraging of reality tv or pop music but I didn't think I was being harsh, either. It felt like a loving poke followed by happy participation, but I'd do it differently if I had the chance. She needed me to be reassuring and I didn't pick up on it. 

&nbsp;

Dave was in a bad mood today and he was being very snappy with me. One of the times he made a really sarcastic comment trying to tell me that my suggestion was stupid as the elevator door was closing. This made me really mad, but he already was gone. I stopped, and thought about how he's feeling. Well the job was bigger than we thought and we don't have all we need to get it done quickly, what else is new? Oh, his wife is in town for 4 days and he wants to be the fuck home. I decided to give him a pass for the day and not take offense. As we were leaving the origin I said to him ""am i wrong inferring that you are frustrated to be here when you just want to be home?"". He told me it was that and a few other things but at least I could rule out the possibility that I had done something. I told our 3rd guy in private not to take anything from him personally today. It's not cool to have something taken out on you, but being readily aware of it makes a huge difference.

&nbsp;

On our way home Dave was listening to some audio book that was talking about a couple who'd been together 60 years. That's what I wanted. I know we had a few crazy opening years, but I thought about that in the scope of a lifelong relationship and that's nothing. It's a prologue. I started to feel horrible, but then I looked up and saw this:


  http://i.imgur.com/DaMiBFu.jpg"
"I should be doing homework right now, but how can I when we fought again. I was afraid it would escalate more, but thankful you decided to go back to work.

I'm writing this to remind myself why I want to leave you.

Today's reason, like most, is that you keep blaming me for everything. You blamed me for you skipping out on your class yesterday. You blamed me for you coming home to bring me lunch. You blamed me for not laughing at your jokes. You blamed me for being to high strung. I'm the one who ruined the concert. It's always my fault. How can I forget that I am the reason why everything is wrong. 

But it isn't my fault! You can never take ownership of anything that you do wrong! You chose to skip out on school! You called me saying that you didn't want to go. You sought out my permission, so that later you can blame me as to why you did not go. You were the one that decided to go, but you needed me to be your scapegoat.

You called me today and offered to bring me lunch! I didn't call you. I never call you. You suggested that you would pick up food and bring me food. Of course I agreed to it, so now it makes it my fault? Like i sought you ought and called you and demanded that you bring me lunch? Why did you blame me for that too?

Oh we got in an argument because you made a joke that wasn't a joke. ""I'm just going to take the rest of the day off so that I can take a nap with you."" Oh thats a joke? Or is that the norm for you to be so lazy? Who skipped out on school yesterday? Who is always not wanting to go to work? You... but somehow, I was supposed to see this as a joke? It's my fault that we fought about this because I didn't laugh at this super hilarious joke. Oh, it's because I am too high strung? Oh, I'm sorry that I take my responsibilities seriously. You come home equates to me not getting my homework done. Why would I want you to not go back to work? Dude you have fucking responsibilities that you decided to take over the moment you told me that I wouldn't be working anymore because we were having a kid. It's biting you in the ass now that you have to work all the time. Adulting sucks, but you are the fucking adult with a wife and two kids. Do what you gotta do. We all do. It's a part of growing up.

But that is my problem with you. How you always find a way to put all the blame on me no matter how small the fight is. And that is what ticks me off. I literally stare at you in your face watching you spew the words to blame me. Never once do you recognize your wrong doing. Never once do you say sorry either.

I don't want to forget the exact details that make me want to leave you. Thats why I am writing. I can't forget these. Because the cycle always continues, and then enough time passes where I hate you a tiny bit less, and the world of comfort ensues. Well, I don't want this life. And believe it or not, I'm always day dreaming about a life I want. One where I am happy and free to do whatever I want to do. One where I'm not blamed on the stupid shit. This life isn't for me. And I blame you for that. "
"It's a beautiful feeling when you have a moment and figure exactly what you were doing wrong and how to fix it. It's amazing how simple it is really. But then again I always tend to over think things so that shouldn't be a surprise. 

I think I fucked up by purposely trying to be more emotional with people. I don't care what anyone says but being vulnerable is not cute and it is not rewarding. It's just too complicated before you really get to know someone ( for romance or friendships). Shit, it's still complicated even after you get to know someone. So so risky T_T No worse feeling than laying your entire soul bare to someone only to be betrayed lol

I prefer being cool, calm, collected, and most importantly distant. At least in the beginning.I feel like I need to take back control of my emotional well being.

Insanity is doing the same thing again and again then expecting different results. Not too keen on wasting my time anymore."
"It feels like it's been forever since I've been interested in someone romantically and sexually at the same time. It's usually one or the other. I've had a rough and weird year because of a crazy bout of depression that resulted in a complete life flip. 

Honestly, I'm writing this out here because I don't have much luck getting ""chance"" encounters to move forward. Unless it's someone I regularly see or already have on social media, I basically meet a fantastic person and the next day think ""that was nice, what a shame I won't ever see him again"". I don't want that to happen because, like I mentioned before, it was a new kind of connection for me and, if I read the situation correctly, he seemed to at least be interested. 

I know his girl bff. My bff knows him. I have this superstition (that has proved true so far in my life) that when I follow them online first, it hits a dead end. Or if I mention interest to anyone in close contact, it hits a dead end. Like, my last boyfriend literally happened out of nowhere, I had not considered him as more than a friend until he was no longer a friend. So, I'm at a loss. I figure I could go out on the weekend with my bff or his girl bff and see if it works out. Other than that, I'm simply a speck of dust on the furniture of life.

Thanks, diary, appreciate it.
wutwot"
"Lots of good things happened this week. I think I've finally realized my self worth for starters. I just had an aha moment and realized that life is too short for self loathing and general feelings of unworthiness. I'm deserving of love and appreciation just like anyone else. 

Also, I think I'm going to finally put on my jigida this week. I have had them for a while but I never felt I was pretty or feminine enough to wear them. I realize that is silly now. I'm just so at peace now. It's a good feeling. "

An online journal feels more safe and anonymous than a nondescript book on a shelf.  I hope you enjoy my story - it's the first of many.

My dear friend,

I’ve been laying in bed for hours, trying to organize my maelstrom of thoughts. I haven’t put my heart into words in so many years. You know something is wrong. So very wrong. I almost let it slip last night. I did, really - I told you in explicit terms, then passed it off as a joke. It was the alcohol speaking. I was being silly. I just wanted your reaction. I gave you any number of excuses to stop you from pressing further. I still don’t know why I said it. Part of me wants you to keep pushing. To confront me. To make me explain why I’d say something so wildly absurd.

What if you did? Could I tell you my story? The entire tale? You would expect complete honesty, and you’d deserve it. You would tell me what I want to hear; that nothing matters, that I mean the world to you, and that I’d always be your closest friend. You would throw it all aside, hug me, and tell me that it’s okay.

I’m sorry. I can’t give you that honesty. Not to your face. I value you too much to risk losing you from my life.
You’re a creative young woman. It is the origin of our friendship. Maybe you’ll find this letter - the first of many - buried among a thousand other short stories, and maybe you’ll see the author shares my name. Maybe you’ll wonder if just one of these fictional tales could be based in reality.

I’ll always be your friend.

Amélie"
"I really want a boyfriend. I miss having someone to cuddle and watch TV with. It's always nice to have someone to spend the night in with. And back rubs. But seriously though, this is getting really annoying. Everyone is getting in relationships/engaged/married on my Facebook and I'm just over here lonely af lol. 

I also really want to put on some weight. Everybody seems to love curves nowadays. Minus my padded bra I have zero. I think I'm just going to stop wearing the damn thing. It is uncomfortable :( Eating extra calories is really hard though. I think I drink to much water. I should just start drinking more alcohol. I can kill two birds with one stone by drowning my sorrows and putting on some pounds <3

This past week was really hard. School is a lot and I've been thinking about my family reunion this coming summer and how my uncle won't be there. It's crazy how quickly life changes. 

But what's a girl to do about it? "
"Sometimes it takes me a second to remember that I don't fit into labels well. It takes me a minute to remember that I stress over this stuff too much. But at the same time, I want to call myself bisexual. But can I, if I feel like I'm just dumb stereotype?

Thank god for the people at /r/Bisexual, they saved my butt from completely ripping apart my identity like I usually do."
"September 24th, 2015

Dear Diary,

Today I am feeling very low, but even though my mood is low, I feel this little beam of hope poking through the cloud of guilt hanging over my head. My mood has been low a lot lately, in spite of the medications that I am taking. For a while, it was like nothing in the world was wrong. I didn’t get irritated easily and I was just content. But now, I am feeling a lot of pressure. I am feeling less than content. I am feeling restless and like I’m not progressing enough as a person, or in my life or career in any aspect.

I know that it’s ridiculous to say that I haven’t progressed as a person. I have progressed a lot. I have fewer blow-ups than I used to have and, the majority of the time, I have a level head. But, in spite of all these things, when my mood is low, all I can think about is all of my insecurities and all of the things that I have ever done wrong in my life. I think about horrible, horrible stuff.

I just made myself a secret reddit account that allows me to confess all of my misdeeds, in hope that I can start to find inner peace. I’ve found that the root of my low self-esteem is that I can’t forgive myself for the mistakes I’ve made. I am trying to take a step toward self-forgiveness so that I can start feeling a sense of self-worth. 

I am a little stressed right now, if I am being honest. I am actually a little stressed about a lot of things. The stress is building up and I need to find a way to release it. So, Diary, I’m going to let it all go on you!

Next week, I go to Singapore with boyfriend. I need to come up with a ton of money and I’m having a difficult time doing so. I don’t know. There’s that, combined with the stress of traveling and it’s making a Molotov Cocktail of my brain. I have a week. That’s it. One week and I leave for Singapore. 

Next on my list of stress is how much I stressed my boyfriend out with our fight last night. It was my fault. I should know that he is very, very touchy about me being insecure. Last night, I found out why. He thinks that my insecurities stem from mistrust in him. And I guess, to a degree, they do, in that I am not being trusting of him to stay with me. We are as secure as we have ever been, and now I need to remind myself of that on the daily.

I feel like I am a huge burden on my friends. My boyfriend told me last night that I take too much energy and that, if we weren’t dating, he wouldn’t be my friend because of how much I require. Right at first, his comment made me feel really hurt, but then, I got to thinking about it and now I think I’m more grateful for my friends than I was before. 

I go to the doctor on Monday to get more of my prescription medication for my depression and anxiety. I am not looking forward to it because going to the hospital is always stressful. It takes forever to get to, forever to wait, and forever to get back home, or to wherever I am going. 

I took on too much tutoring this year. Which sucks. It leaves me with very little free time. I feel like I’ve used that free time very efficiently, thus far. But I am starting to feel a little rundown and occasionally left out. I think it partly has to do with the situation I am currently living in (my friend is crashing at my house) and partly to do with the fact that almost every day when I come home, there are multiple people in my house. I am an introvert and I need some space. On Saturday night, I’ll finally get some of that space and get some alone time with my boyfriend. Hopefully that’ll help with our arguing.

Anyway, it’s almost time to get back to teaching. I’ll write another entry tomorrow.

"you don’t understand the way you make me feel. for fucks sake i don’t understand how you make me feel. all i know is that when i see you, my day instantly becomes better. you make me smile more than anyone ever has in the past few years and you make my laugh so easily. thinking about you makes my knees weak and my heart start pounding.   
nothing has ever been this easy for me and that fucking scares me. i’m not entirely sure if it scares me more that i like you this much for only knowing you a short amount of time, or if it’s because you don’t like me back and i have no chance with you.   
we’ve barely hung out and i feel more comfortable around you than i have with people i’ve known my entire life, yet at the same time you make me feel like i’m thirteen again with a stupid crush on a boy in my class that i can’t get the nerve to talk to.   
you’re so sad and all i want to do is put all of my happiness into you and do anything you need me to do to see you smile. you deserve to smile. you deserve to laugh. you deserve to be happy.   
i don't know what to do anymore. you want someone to love you and all i want to do is scream that i'm right fucking here.   
i know you said that it's because we're both not entirely mentally stable right now, and that's okay. i'm going to work on getting healthy. i'm going to work on getting in a good place so that way i can just get a second chance."
"Hey guys!

Some of you may know that I've been pretty innactive for a while so I've not been able to help /u/ri0tnrrd with the CSS, but I'm back to help...for the time being. I have a few weeks left before I'm gone again and I don't know how long I'll be gone since I'm packing up everything and Ive decided to just go travel the world. I'll occassionally have connection to the internet but I can't guarantee when. Because of this I'll work as hard as possible with /u/ri0tnrrd to finish the CSS  and I'm prepared to answer any queries you have about the subreddit or any questions in general. I'm sorry for notifying you so late.

Thanks!

"But RIP anyway little buddy <3 My mini sewing machine finally gave up the ghost today. We've been through so many adorable projects together. I guess it is time to invest in a quality full size. _^ This weekend has been a good one overall though. Saw a lot of people I haven't seen in so long.My little brother graduated. Finally caught up on some of my shows and FTLOAS posts on tumblr and slept soundly. Why can't every weekend be like this?
I can't wait for the Strain to come back on. I was really salty about the end of season 1. Worst ending ever. Hopefully season 2 can redeem the show. American Horror Story failed me with this last season and I just can't take any more TV heartbreak."
"The more they stay the same unfortunately. It's amazing the lengths people I know will go to maintain the complex lies they tell. Absolutely stunning. Isn't it just easier to tell the truth? Keeping multiple stories straight in your head sounds like an awful amount of work. Not to mention this world is a small place and people who you think would not cross paths somehow always manage to. Essentially, word gets around. People talk. I kind of enjoy it though. I get a weird sense of pleasure watching people paint themselves into a corner with their lies and still attempt to bullshit me right to my face. That takes a lot of guts haha. But I'm starting to get very weary of the whole thing. It's downright depressing. I feel like a shell of my former self. I'm tired of successfully predicting which of the new people I meet is actually a scumbag. Being right about that kind of stuff is always a lose-lose situation. Is loyalty and honesty so much to ask for? 

On a less negative note my pashmina finally came in the mail <3"
"Hey guys!

You may have noticed that the subreddit has been looking a bit odd lately - I've been trying to change some of the CSS. I found it kind of difficult so /u/ri0tnrrd offered to do it (thanks!). The subreddit should look decent again soon!

"Today something very weird happened. I'm a senior in High School and the student by my side tells the teacher she doesn't understand the subject in a satisfactoy manner. Granted, the subject is rather easy, but what follows, although i'm pretty sure was an accident by my teacher,  remains unwarranted:

-""Hello there, class!"" My teacher greets us. ""Today we continue with where we left off last thursday. Is anyone having any difficulty?""

-""Well"" My colleague interrupts. ""I didn't understand a single thing!""

-""How can you not understand it?(...)"" Now at this point i have to warn you that the worst happens. I'm not looking to make a scary text, hence the [Real] tag, so be warned. ""(...)You should kill yourself.""

Then again, it was all in rushed manner, and the teacher helped her achieve an understanding of the subject that was considered enough and on par with the rest of the class, but what happened made my jaw drop. My colleague was pretty offended too, and the teacher didn't apologize.

"Normally I would post something like this on my tumblr, but the guy that I'm currently falling for is following me now, so that wouldn't end well.   
I understand that most people that use Tinder are just looking for a hookup - but that's not the case for everybody. I specifically put in my profile that I was looking for a legit relationship. But I downloaded Tinder in order to meet new people since it's harder for me to do with my anxiety weighing me down constantly. It's much easier to talk to people through a screen rather than in person. Because of my past relationships, I'm a bit cautious, but for some reason I fall in love much easier than I'd like.   
I've been talking to this guy for a little over a month now, and I feel as if I'm already falling for him. I slept over his house twice (we didn't do anything in case you were wondering lol), and I feel so comfortable around him. That doesn't happen often, so it's such a nice feeling to feel that again.   
My heart feels like it's going to explode. Hearing his name makes me smile like an idiot. I feel like I'm 14 again. I want to spend so much time with him and learn about his flaws. I want to know his strangest likes and dislikes. He is so gorgeous and funny and stupid and I hate it. I hate this because I can't tell him I'm already falling in love with him without ruining everything. He told me he likes me, but I always end up pushing everyone away or ruining it. I'm going to be so upset if I ruin this relationship too.   
He told me he wasn't looking for anyone else since he met me, but he just got out of a four year relationship...
So now it's time to sit here like a lost puppy.   
I hate it.   
Why is falling in love so complicated? :/"
"Hi everyone!

"A little backstory on my current ""relationship status"". Btw, I'm doctoring out the names of people just for my own sanity.

Many would say I am ""in a relationship"" physically. Physically A and I are in a relationship. We live together as two college students, in one house, but we have two separate bedrooms. We cook food together, play video games together, the lot. But emotionally and mentally I am no longer invested in A. We've transitioned from an actively romancing couple who used to enjoy going on walks and dates to a sedentary friend-like couple who I believe is just like two best friends living together. No sex, no kissing, no touching, or holding hands.

Now here is where my problems have started. I have friends that like to hang out with me outside of class and until the wee-hours of the morning. This is no problem for A, he just plays video games by himself anyway, or he'll Skype his buddies and play with them. We have only ever played one game together and as my schoolwork has become more important to me, the video games have become less so.

I now present you with my main confession.

One of my friends and I had sex last night. This friend, Q, is only the second guy I've ever had sex with (the other being A) and it finally felt right. I just remember driving home from his house and wanting to pull over at the park and to lay on the grass and cry tears of happiness. Whenever I had sex with A it was always so painful and he always made me know that it was my fault for that. A always pointed out my insecurities like how one of my nipples is inverted and that my tummy isn't completely flat or that my boobs jiggle a lot because they are just massively out of proportion with my body.

But it wasn't like that with Q. I don't know if it was just the built up sexual tension between us or what, but I didn't feel insecure about being completely naked around him. I didn't feel like one minute I was going to be praised for providing sexual relief and the next ridiculed for what I could've done better. I now feel stupid for typing this and having to hold back tears because of how ridiculously happy I was and am. I felt completely and totally adored last night and it was a wonderful feeling.

Thank you for reading... <3"
"I have recently toyed with the idea of starting a podcast or YouTube channel. I have already questioned my motives. I do not want fame or even notoriety. I have simply arrived at the place of wanting to share everything I have with as many people as I can, and learn through conversation with as many people as possible.

My first topic has been chosen for me. It is resistance. That resistance which always arises at the threshold of our dreams. The thing which keeps our dreams from being realized. The thing that makes us hit the snooze button on the alarm clock instead of getting up, wash the dishes instead of making that call, and busy our hands instead of being still or intentional. I have been obsessed with the world of productivity and self-development for years, because for as long as I can remember I have been hyper-aware of how much dread fills my shadow and follows me around. And, with how prevalent procrastination humor has become on the internet, it is clear that most people carry a similar dread. I call it ""paralysis"". I can actually feel the venom in my veins every day. And, it cannot be allowed to go unapproached or else the whole day has been handed over to the sluggard in my bones which thrives under the weight of inaction or, as I have called it many times before, ""preparation"". So many lies I have told myself. So many lies. And, just beyond them, are wonders incomparable to anything else. Those things which lie on the other side of fear and resistance are what make life worth living.  Life is hard whether we confront our fears or not, but in one universe there is purpose and meaning in the suffering, in the other there is none.

My second topic would be to talk about God. What I used to believe God was, what made me question that belief, and how I am embarking on a new journey toward understanding the Divine in ways my mother might call sacrilegious.

Depth and sincerity is my goal. I want to learn a lot and give everything I have. I have no idea if anyone will tune in, but I will never know what could be possible if I don't give it a shot. I am terrified. But, oh my god, I want to at least get a taste of what exists beyond that terror!"
"One of my fears is that I will spend my life striving for things that I don't really want nor ever really needed.

Another is that what I produce will be misunderstood because I, in fact, have no idea what I am doing.

These fears are never more assaulting than when I am sitting, staring at a blank page, and the cursor is blinking up at me, expectant. Most of the time, we both leave this stand off disappointed because we are both still standing. Writing is the most violent act I have ever committed and I commit it against myself. I think this is the 'universe' that T.S. Eliot feared to disturb; the Infinite Self. The pen truly is sharper than the sword. It cuts deep with every stroke. So, because I am afraid, more often than not, I avoid the blank page, the blinking cursor. However, these daily writings may save me yet. I am learning how to give myself space to write without judgement or any kind of expectation, to be inspired and raw."
"Here I am again: sitting on the green electrical box outside of my friends dealers place. We were here about a half an hour ago. He is so high on fentanyl that we barely made it here. Every time I ask if he is okay to drive it's , “ Oh yeah of course.” I don't know why I put myself in these positions. The addiction is that grasping that it just surpasses any kind of self-preservational thought. Am I really that out of control.…..?
 I'm usually only on this box for about two three minutes. As I say this, I am watching him pull up. Back in the Honda Civic from hell."
"I got my second vaccination dose on Friday. There weren't any symptoms to report, at first, anyway. Then, the horrible muscle aches and this drunken feeling I had started to slowly creep in. God, it was awful. This always happens to me whenever I get vaccinated, regardless of the vaccine type. This time, however, it felt especially awful. I had a fever the entire night, though it wasn't entirely unbearable. A few caps of Tylenol and I was all set.

I feel much better now, and now that I'm fully vaccinated, it's a great feeling. Still, we're not out of this pandemic yet, and there's still more of the population that needs their vaccine--if they're willing to get it, anyway.

Slightly off topic: I notice I haven't been sweating as much. I can *feel* myself getting sweaty, but there's hardly any liquid coming out of my pores. It sounds weird, but that's the best way I can describe it. A lot of people, including the physicians I work with, tell me it's because I'm not hydrating enough. I hope that's the reason. I'm thinking of telling my PCP, but I'd rather not him refer me to a specialist. I really don't want to go see any doctors right now.

It was my father's birthday yesterday. I got him a small gift, a shaving kit. He appreciated it and told me he loved me, etc., etc. He keeps nagging onto me on when I'm gonna get a wife and have children. Ugh, it's so annoying. I really don't see myself as the marrying type, honestly. Let alone that, I can't even begin to imagine having children of my own! I need to take better care of myself first before I can do the same for someone close to me.

The future is something I keep trying to avoid. I know all of this won't last forever for me, one day. I don't like to think about it. It's a scary thought. I rather keep moving and let everything be as much as a surprise as possible.

I got the day off tomorrow, thanks to President's Day. Hallelujah. Even an extra day will be a relief for me.

I'm not going to talk about work in this entry.

Have a goodnight."
"Letter VIII

In this passage, Seneca reminds us that what fortune brings us as a gift is not truly ours to own. One of the core principles expanded upon really. The core idea being that there are things we have complete control over and things we don’t. The dichotomy of control. Well articulated by the great philosopher Epictetus in his book “Discourses and Selected Writings”

“[1] We are responsible for some things, while there are others for which we cannot be held responsible. The former include our judgement, our impulse, our desire, aversion and our mental faculties in general; the latter include the body, material possessions, our reputation, status – in a word, anything not in our power to control.”


A personal and classic stoic metaphor for this lesson is a traveler staying at a hotel. We should regard everything “not in our power to control” as the traveler does the hotel. He’s vigilant with the information that this is not his room; he is merely there for the night, and the next morning, he swiftly leaves the room as it is without a second thought. For he knows that this room isn’t his, again, he is merely borrowing it for a pre selected amount of time and when his time is up then he is quick to release “ownership”. He doesn’t complain about how quick time fleets towards the time he must depart, he simply enjoys the room for what it is (a place to rest his head), and off he goes about his business unaffected by the loss of the room.

It’d be wise for humanity to carry the same vigilance regarding our possessions, and truly anything “not in our power to control”. 

Realize that anything that you do not solely control is not entirely under your own ownership, but is at it’s core, an external. And as all true Stoics know, focusing on externals is not only a surefire path towards disappointment but is also an opportunity for you to stray away from the path and progress you’ve worked so hard to achieve in yourself, internally. For taking account of externals comes at some cost of your Internals.---
So remember, what you own is not truly yours to own. Enjoy as you can, but do not be upset when you must return what doesn’t belong to you. As a traveler returns his room after a (hopefully) comfortable night, you too must return what isn’t rightfully yours to own. Also remember that time is comparable to the world serpent, the world eater. With a giant gaping hole of a mouth, it will consume everything, even your mere little material obsessions. To time does everything truly belong, therefore no disappointment should arise when it’s time to surrender what’s in your possession. To end this passage, I’ll leave here another beautiful quote from Seneca regarding the attitude we should have; grateful for what we currently have in possession, but no less content without.

“The wise man is neither raised up by prosperity nor cast down by adversity; for always he has striven to rely predominantly on himself, and to derive all joy from himself.”"

"At some point tomorrow I'm going to either go to hospital or kdoc. My chest physically hurt earlier, (more than normal which happens a lot) is causing random arrhythmia and I'm scared. 

I think I need my meds reassessed."
"I have always loved being the oldest of 4 kids. I could set an example, pave a way for my brothers, and always be a corner stone in their foundation. This is especially true coming from a Hispanic Immigrant Family. I was going to be the first one to graduate high school and college and help my family achieve their dreams. I never realized how much that weighs on a person. 

In a span of a year I fell in love and started my own family, meaning that I left behind my parents and brothers and I feel very guilty. I do not know how people do this. They were my life and now I see them maybe once or twice a week due to work and my wife and kids. My brothers were my best friends, they were the reason why I did not commit suicide a few years ago when I was in a really dark place. I guess I just wasn't prepared for this. It just kind of happened. One day I am spending the whole day at home with my parents and brothers and next thing I know I am having a kid, leaving somewhere else that feels far away. As the oldest in a Hispanic family it is so hard for me to let go of them and they of me. It feels like I went from being a third parent to a stranger that pops up every once in a while.

How do you handle being the oldest and making a life for yourself, when you know that you probably weren't ready? I guess time will tell"
"I'm still under very intense psychiatric supervision but I don't seem to be able to calm down. I'm in a lot of emotional pain, my fear of abandonment is raging and even staying in call with my friends doesn't help me.

I wish it was easier. They're trying so hard to protect and help me but I'm starting to feel like I'm beyond help."
"I answered my pain clinic appointment and was pleasantly surprised to find out that these people genuinely believe me and want to help me. It's not everyday as a chronically ill person that you find someone that doesn't see you as a drug seeker.

I'm finally being taken seriously and it means a lot to me."
"i slept 8 hours and i studied for an hour i didn't get a haircut even though it was on my list i also didn't exercise and i couldn't think of 5 things that made me happy today i also meditated which felt good and I'm pretty happy about studying for my SAT it made me feel good but i still don't feel satisfied

"

     So yesterday I gave a drug dealer 2 fake hundred dollar bills for my usual scoop. I got away with it.…. Until now. I'm sitting at work today, dropping an oil pan on a Chevy Silverado, and he walks up behind me, and confronts me.
	The kids got to be early 20's, if not younger. We walk to the back of the shop, behind the fence. He asked me where his money is. I told him I ain't got it at the moment. Ask me to turn my pockets inside out, I have nothing in them. He tells me if I don't have his money by 5:00 he's going to be my ass.
I go back to work, my boss asks what's that about. I give him some BS story. Over the last few weeks I've been doing some stupid s***, and it's all because of the drugs.
	I text my mom, and and tell her I need money for rent. After a few text messages saying that they're broke too, she finally said she'll send me some money, via Walmart.
	After work I make my way toward Walmart. On the way I call another guy, and ask him if he's in the area. He says he is but he only has a few caps. I tell him that's fine, and he says he'll meet me at Walmart. I finally walked the mile and a half to Walmart, waiting line, finally get to the register and get my money.
	As soon as the receipt prints, the guy waiting on me calls and it says he has to leave, and asks where I'm at. I run out the door and go meet him. Afterwards I walk back into Walmart to get a lime. You can't shoot crack without a lime or some kind of citric acid. I make my way to the Walmart bathroom, and proceed to shoot some crack.	I text my mom and tell her that everything's okay and I got the money. She tells me to be safe on my way home, and to text her when I get there. I start making my way on the 3 Mile Walk home.
	I make it about a half a block from Walmart, and find a bridge that I can go underneath and shoot more crack. Afterwards I look at Google maps and see what the fastest route home is for walking. I stopped at the gas station on the way to grab something to drink, and a little snack. I'm listening to a podcast about the Spanish Inquisition. The types of torture they did was pretty f****** insane.
About a mile from my house I find a little Park area with some benches, and a light right above it, and proceed to sit down and again rig up some crack.
	At that point, I walk the final leg home. About three blocks from my house I see a lady crouch down against the wall, with a lighter cooking up what looks to be heroin. Honestly, none of this phases me. It's the lifestyle I've lived for the last 15 years.
	I finally make it home, text my mom and tell her so. I sit down, turn on Netflix, and again proceed to rig up the last amount of crack that I have. My phone rings, it's the guy I ripped off. I tell him I have a little bit of money for him, and over the next couple days I'll hustle up the rest. He's okay with that. He tells me to meet him outside, so I throw on some shorts and some shoes and walk outside and wait for him. He pulls up, and asks me what made me think about doing that to him. I told him I got f***** up on some Xanax and it just seemed like a good idea at the time. I told him id make it right, and I will. This is my day. This seems to be almost everyday for me. I don't want to live this life every single day anymore. I think about how I can get out of this loop. I'll find a way. I'll figure it out, like I always do."

22 holed up last day to smoke


23 no still smoking instead of staying away, 


face it, confront it, apologize for being weirdo.


It's all very reasonable. Maybe even mend the fence?


Put it right, probably got kid freaked out with my back and forth changing mind, bailing cuz I'm wrapped up in some paranoia.


So I do


Figure gets ignored like everything else


But it'll be done and off my shoulders


It's not tho


Gets acknowledged


Don't remember you


Fair enough. I wasn't anyone back then.


Let it go I think...no, respond, tell who I am


Go to. Only been 5 min. Not like hours, days later


Nope. No response necessary.


In fact, don't


In fact, blocked


Yea


Shut that right down


Made feelings very clear


Fuck off, get lost


That's it.


There is no relenting no coming back


No hey sorry who are you?


No face to face friendly smile happy nice good


I'll always be that person


The creepy crazy bitch who kept trying to talk to him


The one he finally told to fuck off and blocked


There's no happy ending


Even the delusion knows


It's all crumbled


I look out upon the ashes


Of hopes dreams something good


Of memory"
"I've been building an excellent reputation, it seems. I knew this day would come: the Professor is enlisting my assistance to other researchers in different labs. You remember that special machine I work with? The one where I, apparently, am the only person who knows (for now) how to operate? Well, after the two successful runs I've had with it, the Professor was so pleased that he's given me the responsibility to work with other researchers from different labs.

Yeah...great. Look, I appreciate the buildup on my reputation, but this is just going to give me more work. I honestly don't mind too much, but these guys had better do a majority of their own preparation. I'm only going to be running the machine's protocols, and that's it. If the Professor expects me to do *everything* in regards to this instrument, I'm putting my foot down.

My boss doesn't want me to teach anyone on how to operate this thing, at least not yet anyway. I don't see what the point of that is. It's not like any of this stuff is secret, and anyone--scientist or not--can download the entire manual from the manufacturer's website and read it themselves. Rather, he doesn't want anybody, not even in our own lab, except myself, to touch and play around with the machine. 

I understand where he's coming from, but sooner or later, the other scientists in our lab are going to complain to him. I hope he at least charges these collaborators for our services. I wish I would get paid extra for this, but nope, that's never happening.

Whatever. I don't have a choice, and, once again, this'll look good for my CV.

I need to relax more, somehow, someway."
"It was my birthday a few days ago, though I don't feel any older. Honestly, with what's been going on, it hasn't really felt like anything new with this year. Like I said before, only the number of the calendar changed. Besides, it's way too early to see anything change for the better. That is, *if* it changes for the better.

My family wished me a happy birthday and gave me a gift: a new winter coat. I rarely buy apparel; I'm particularly stingy with my money. So, it was a nice thing for them to do that for me. I did return the favor and bought my mom a new handbag and wallet for her birthday, which was yesterday. She wasn't happy, saying to me that she didn't want anything, but I think it's fair repayment after what she and dad gave me.

I received my first shot of the vaccine against the COVID virus. I'm slated for a second dose in February. I only felt the usual adverse effects of muscle pain and weakness, but that's always been a thing with me, regardless of the vaccine type. Otherwise, I haven't grown a third arm or have experienced anything else as some ridiculous people have claimed. I was one of the lucky ones to receive it early, and now I can only hope and wait for others to do the same.

Our state went back into an ""emergency phase"" again. It was expected after the holidays, but I didn't think it was going to be this bad. Actually, that's half of a lie. With the amount of traveling people are doing and further with those who have not been respecting and abiding by the public health measures put into place, it shouldn't be any surprise. Then, of course, you can add the fact that this soon-to-be gone administration (good riddance) damned our efforts into combating this thing from the very beginning.

My boss has been in an incredibly foul mood these first weeks of 2021. He's been cooped up in his office doing nothing but grant writing and sitting for hours upon hours in meetings with our collaborators. He's been nice to me, but I can feel his tension every time he steps out of the office to take a break. That, and the fact that he's been cussing a lot. I try to stay out of his way as much as possible, because I want him to be happy, and he's the guy who's signing my checks so I don't want to get on his bad side.

With that being said, I've been in his place for some of his meetings. He's entrusted me to be there in his place because he's too busy with other meetings. The collaborators I've spoken with have been kind to me, but they're sometimes extremely interrogatory in their tone, though it's understandable. They've been constantly asking me, ""Where's the Professor? Why are you here instead of him?"", and I have to explain to them, again, I'm here in his place because he's too damn busy with other meetings. They sometimes treat me like I'm part of the wall, and it gets particularly frustrating when they discuss among themselves as to why I'm here instead of my boss *while I'm still in the same meeting room*.

I'm definitely still going with my plan and leaving at the end of this year, or at least when it comes close to it. We've got a fully staffed lab now, but I'm still juggling too much between data analysis, training of other scientists, daily lab tasks, and now these business meetings. It's excellent experience and I've no doubt it'll beef up my resume after this, but it's exhausting, and, again, the pay is trash.

My brother and sister have been trying to get internships, but it's been almost impossible. It's even more aggravating, according to them, to be conducting these interviews via Zoom or Microsoft Teams, or whatever conference app they're required to have. They tell me it feels unnatural, and there've been a few times where the people conducting the interviews don't know how to host a meeting. If I go for a new job and this pandemic doesn't come to a close soon, that's going to be me next!

I'm taking better care of myself and the ones I care about. I've been trying to ebb away from those awful thoughts, especially the ones that remind me of the past. Still, it hasn't been easy. I just need to keep moving."
"However, that doesn't make it, and my disappointment, any lesser. I'm just truly and utterly done today. It doesn't matter how I feel toward this because things will not change."
"Life's really lovely, huh?

It's alright. I suppose to have an online job interview today but UNIVERSE really conspired just to tell me either two things,

One is, i need to change back to my course, I need to go back to God

Or

Second, maybe it's just not for me and God is telling me otherwise.

So what exactly happened?

Last night, I had this thought while having pre-interview jitters, I have this thought where

""What if things go wrong tomorrow? What if there's a sudden power outage tomorrow before my interview?""

And so, yeah, I hoped it won't happen.

40 minutes before the interview, I've sent the interviewer things he needed (documentation, papers, etc) he also needed some computer specs and he asked me if I do have extra computers or laptops because the work will be online.

I said, no, I don't have. Fair enough, yeah. I asked myself, maybe it's just a simple hindrance, not that heavy at all.

Then you won't believe what happens next.

15 minutes before the actual interview, there's a sudden power outage in my home. 

*insert blinking guy meme here* and I was like,

Did that just really happened?! 

I was dumbfounded and amazed. And terrified. There's a lot of things needed to be filled here.

🙃

It felt like a big slap to my face, from the universe. It felt like Darkseid was the universe and I was Atom. It goes hard. It kinda gets heavy. Because I'm having so much trouble finding job.

And when I found one, I kinda scares it away.

I'm jinxed.

😄😆"
"Hi there, first time speaking to myself in here. 

I wouldn’t even doing this if it was not because I did drugs and get high again this day. To be honest with me, drugs have fucked me up entirely and I’ve said more than a thousand times this dumb shit and I keep going and going without a full stop for a good fucking time. 

Ángel, this words are for you: this time is crucial for you and you’ve been to pick up a choice up to this time that will never get to happen again. You’ve lost your feet from the earth. You’re constantly living under this dream which appears to be put away your pain from your soul and your obsession has overweighted any of the positive aspects that you were able to enjoy on each ‘painless’ session, that is all gone now. You’ve played yourself and the devil has attached your most preciously part of yourself: ‘your soul, but also your own body and mental strength.’ 

Ángel, I know sobriety can be scary and withdrawals are even a lot more; but you’ve no choice up to this point. You’ve got no excuses anymore for keeping this up and you know exactly the reason as per why this hasn’t changed at all. The only one who could perform these miracle and make it work throughout the rest of my life once and for all is by making the decision of wanting to do it. 

If I wanted to get sober I’d have gotten it done a long time ago, since the day I commit to want such decision.

I feel I am fooling myself every day and I don’t realize it but only just a couple of times every time to time and for a matter of seconds. It’s such an evaluation that realizes how my decisions of every day are destroying my own self. Slowly process that goes undercover onto my consciousness whenever I am awaken, hard to spot most of the times and difficult to maintain as your real self for a few period of time before it shades away and dumbs my own form of being again. 

If drugs were meant to be fun, then why do I do them if the fun disappeared a long time ago. I know addiction is the key role playing in here but I never cared. I never gave a fuck about getting hooked up since I did not understand the withdrawals from this. So, why are you so stupid?

You’ve got everything to success and opportunities are still there ready for you to pick them up but they won’t last long until they go away. Contacts? Don’t worry about them, a year or two of hard work can get you on the road again. I need to position myself in the place that I deserve: on the top. Probably a way more harder than I could imagine right now, but before being there I need to be on the opposite side and start from the bottom. 

_________________________________________________________

Angel, stop fucking around now and take the damn decision before it’s too late. It’s closer than you think and you won’t have the chance to decide my own way to detox myself. It’s hard to get a closer image of the real feelings that such an explosion of them would have impact and affect my own self, until it becomes the real truth of my own present and of course all of these aspects understood by theory then turned into practice. I’m still here by the theory, Angel, come on! Don’t screw it up and make it a living experience were withdrawals will kick at its fullest and my only wish baby then would be to get all these mental suffering, physically sickness, painfully experiencing a desperately reality in the look external relief – which won’t be even a choice there and would mentally be force to deal with it as it – and also on top of all of these, a devastating feeling of depression and anxiety. 

So, Angel, once you get there you need to know that nobodies to blame but you. The choice was yours and it lasted for longer than it should have been. 

Ángel, just take the decision. It may sound easy but deeply look inside of yourself and examínate the way you’ve been living all these last years. 

Be honest with you, Angel, you haven’t stopped yet because you have not wanted to do it up to this point. You want to keep using the drug in order to reach a high that it’s worthless, dangerous, dirty, nasty, expensive and physically destructive as it leaves marks that seem to last for ever. Be honest, Angel, do you really want to stop now? Or is this the kind of life you want to keep on living for the rest of hot life/or at least the next decade or so until hitting rock bottom?

Ángel, you’re 22yo, it’s not that late yet to make a change. Success it’s not on your side as of now, but failure. You’re kind of a loser as to this time and you know it. The question is: you really want to keep being this loser until you turn 30-40yo and you still have nothing accomplished in your life?

Please deeply take a chance to read and deeply think about these questions. Understand its significances and move on by accomplishing the first step into the making of these change and get as ready as you can for what the upcoming hard times. 

“Nobody said it was easy” 

So, Ángel, just listen the fuck up, stop with your bullshit around right now and be responsable for the decisions that you’ve made and fix your life up before it’s too late and your life is a wasted piece of trash who never took advantage of any of the opportunities that were presented during his time. 

Put your pants up, man. Use fucking common sense from now on. Quit drugs and get sober as quick as you can now. Go through withdrawals and face them just in the same way I decided to shoot up this drug since the begin. Be a fucking man and stop being this worthless pussy. 

Stop hiding from withdrawals anymore! They’ll come in one way or another, don’t be stupid and do it now before you get locked up in a small room with no meds to allow me ease the pain. I’ll be locked up before I do think if I do not do it now, as soon as I finish up. 

Take-the-decision-now! Really do it! I’ve been kicked out the addiction before and really now I have to make it again before it’s done to me by force and suffer. That being said, Angel, spend money on weed and acid. Change the set up that your mind has been in for such these long period of time.

Ángel, the idea for more will be here still and won’t go away no matter how much I write and push the desire to stop as of now.

"i wish i could stay out of the social media world forever. but it sucks because its the only way i can keep up with my friends and family. i fantasize about being in a completely different city, not knowing anyone, and just live my life there for a while. tired of the suburbs. i feel stuck and i wanna meet new people.

in this state of the world i sometimes feel obligated to hit up my friends. im not so fond of texting. i know that i should take advantage of it especially during these times, but i just prefer hanging out in person. i miss that so much.

i dont like feeling pressured to do anything. it makes me want to do it even less. it can get irritating and frustrating, knowing that i let this person down just because i cant fulfill their basic needs to nurture this friendship, which is reaching out and initiating the conversation. im tired of feeling this way !!! i dont know if im being completely selfish or if my feelings are valid anymore."
"So I woke up to this warm fuzzy feeling today. I wish my alarm didn't go off so I could continue my dream with him. I was taking the tram with him, when he suddenly put his arm around my neck and forced my upper body on to his legs. He basically shoved my head towards his thighs, affectionately and playfully. We were laughing and giggling, I was pretending to be mad. 

Then he asked me if he could kiss me. 

""No."" I answered through my laughs. Because I'm his friend and he has a girlfriend. But oh how much I wish I could say yes, even if it was just in the dream. Apparently I'm too woke in the dream to even let that slip. I replayed the way we nudged and bantered with each other on the tram. I would've thought we were a couple if I were a stranger looking at us. This is one of the best dreams I've ever had in a while. I miss hanging out with you. I seldom contact you but let me tell you, I think about you almost every day. You told me about your girlfriend and i know you like her, and I'm happy that you like her. I like it this way. You can live your happy life with your girlfriend while I can continue dreaming about you in my dreams. And I can be your old pal who was right there from the start, when we hang out again we'll be like two brothers, talking about everything. I really want to see you again soon."
"In the dawn of Soviet Union times, when the situation in the country was not the best. My mother, Tatyana, already had a two years old girl Aliya and was about to deliver a second one, me.

Also taking into consideration that the marriage with my biological father was not in the best shape and they were already separated, by the time she left to the hospital to deliver me.

The labor was not the easiest, I was a breach baby and got stuck on the way out, in the waist area, the doctors had to pull me out with forceps. While doing that they damaged my spinal cord in the neck area, causing asphyxiation and paralysis of half of the baby's body. Also during the delivery Tatyana's kidneys stop functioning. So the doctors (If I can even call them that) had to make a decision who to save and they choose to save the mother. But as you can see...I survived; good or bad, but I did. After putting out the fires they created themselves, doctors began to attend the baby. 

My mother was in comma for 3 days. After she woke up, she asked to see the baby. Because as she recalls, last thing she saw before passing out is the purple lifeless body of a baby carried away from her. She was certain that I was dead. But to her joy and more of a surprise I was not too well, but still living. Still paralyzed, barely hanging on, but living. My guess is someone upstairs had some kind of a plan for me. I would really want to know the plan though...since now I am 37 and it (the plan) still did not come to me yet. Anyway...

After the eventful delivery and later on countless months of NICU's and therapies, my mother had to make a difficult choice to send my sister to live with the grandparents. By that time she was a single mother at twenty three years old, with two girls, one of which did not leave the hospitals until she was nine month old. And I would have to repeat again... that was Soviet times, when one teacher salary was barely enough to support one adult, needless to say it would not cover an adult, a toddler and a very sick newborn. But thankfully my father's parents helped, I am sure they were definitely feeling bad after what he put my mother through ( that would be a whole another story though). Both of them were very respected doctors with great connections that helped my mother with the appropriate medical support and counseling to treat my condition, before it grew into a permanent Cerebral Palsy. 

I was under physical, psychiatric watch and every week counseling well into my elementary school. In general, due to a lot of health complications caused by the labor, I was a very sick child. I am left, up till now, with asthma, anemia, abnormally low blood pressure, calcium deficiency, iron deficiency, minor mood swings. I am sure if you ask my husband, he would say they are not minor.

So, all and all this is how I came to this world... with a BANG! The waves of which will follow me till I die"
"A global pandemic. A busy nursing program. Crushing debts. “For such a time as this...” My life is exciting and difficult. You’re my friend. You have ALS and you are dying from it. You let me take care of you. You love me. With only one visitor allowed, you think you’re dying and you ask me to be your one person. You ask me in front of your sister and your mom. I feel guilty. Guilty because I love you like a brother and not as a lover. Guilty because I only take care of you 6 hrs per week while your mom takes care of you 24/7. Guilty because you pay me and I’m your friend.You sob in front of me and I cannot be moved to tears. I’m gearing up for whatever is about to go down. I turn myself into something solid. I tell myself that I do this for you, but if I’m honest, I have no choice. You tell me I’m an oak and I just hope I’m not jaded. I feel pressure in my chest and in my throat but I cannot cry. I rarely cry anymore.The night you thought you were dying, I arrived at your house to see the ambulance. I got inside your house just as they were getting you up. I hop in the back of the ambulance and the medic is my best friend’s brother. (This is the first God thing.) I hold your head in a position so you can breathe. We get you to the hospital. The NP admitting you decides at first that you are not a priority and almost transfers you to telemetry. Somehow, I convince her to think again. (2) She reconsiders and you get the last bed in the ICU. (3) In the ICU, you get a doctor who really gets it and he decides to get you the trach on the same day. (4) The surgery is later described as “beautiful” by both the doctor and the anesthesiologist. Something very rare for patients with ALS. (5)I recall a very old memory. One of the earliest ones I have. I’m in a white truck and I’m very sick. My dad is taking me to the hospital. He is worried about me and he is talking to me in his teddy bear voice. He calls me peach and tells me over and over again that he loves me. He points to all the stoplights ahead and he tells me, Look, Peach, Jesus is answering our prayers and He is turning all the lights green for us.”I see Him turning the lights green for you. I hope and hope that you will be healed.I sleep sitting up and then I don’t sleep. When I wake up, I trade places with your mom. My sister takes me home and I shower lying down. I cry. But at the same time I don’t feel. It is as though I am physically crying but not from my guts. I turn the water to as hot as it will go and I don’t feel.I don’t know how to pray when I don’t feel. I don’t know how to have faith when I don’t feel. Yet somehow I know that my silent lament is heard and the Lord sees me. Somehow I know He loves me even when I don’t feel. Sometimes I think that this denial is my anesthesia. A mercy in a strange way. Like turning off long-term memory during a trauma. I’m carrying so many things and I can’t let go of them. I carry the stories from patients I meet in my clinical shifts. I carry the weight of expectations and hopes that I imagine my parents have for me. I carry made up problems and real legitimate ones that don’t belong to me. I carry hurtful comments and all my past mistakes. I carry guilt and worry because my sense of morality and my inner critic are best friends. I carry anger I don’t know how to honor because I taught myself it wasn’t right. I am lost and somehow I know that when I’m lost, I’m also found. I curl up into the fetal position at night in a bed by myself and I’m held there by my creator. I sense this. I am fully know, fully seen, and somehow still fully loved. I am broken and He works all night to stitch me back together for another day. "
"I’ve been using the phrase “jacking off” a lot recently (Relatively speaking. Maybe once a month for the past year, just enough to be noticeable). I don’t use it in the traditional sense, I should say. Not like masturbation. More like “they’re just jacking themselves off over how smart they are” or “you know he’s just jacking himself off when he talks about that.” There’s a special bitterness about the phrase. It’s raunchy, it’s a poignant metaphor, it stings like any good insult should. I remember having similar feeling about the phrase “piss-baby” when I stole it from that 100 gecs song.

I think the theme that’s made me pull from the “jerking off” well so many times recently is ingenuousness. I’ve become sick of the actual words “genuine” and “in-genuine” after this election cycle, when I’ve heard so many young people access politicians solely on that scale. But more than that, I’ve been perceiving ingenuousness in the people around me so much more recently. I’ve gotten too cynical, too insecure, and now whenever anyone acts remotely passionate about anything, or lands a talking point well, I can dismiss it as then “jerking themselves off.” It’s a way to make me feel better; I’m too genuine to try and sound smart in front of other people.

I’m being self-deprecating right now, but I think I’m right sometimes. I think I’m right all the time, if I’m being honest. I live in Portland, a crazy liberal city, and while I’m as progressive as the next guy, I can’t help but think that when there’s no action to back it up, the discourse over things like the implications of celebrating thanksgiving or completely abolishing the police, is performative. We get it, you can have some progressive points, but put your money where your mouth is or you’re just being cynical for the sake of it. You’re just jerking yourself off.

I don’t know. To give myself an ego boost - I think I’m too pragmatic for my own good. I can’t make broad conjecture, I have to make everything actionable. I’m a realist. It’s cool. I’m like Hans Solo, or some shit. I’m like the Hans Solo of identifying when people are jacking themselves off. I don’t know."
"hi :) i hope you're all doing well and staying sane to some extent.

im honestly so glad that i found this reddit community to write out my thoughts and just brain dump free of shame or guilt or whatever else. lately its been hard for me to open up to the people in my life. it's not really their fault though, it's more of a conflict with myself. i always end up feeling... i dont know, guilty? for lack of better term i guess, yeah, i feel guilty when i go on a whole ramble about myself. i literally feel like i sound conceited or narcissistic sometimes but i probably sound like a normal person to other people. there's always a voice in my head that goes ""okay, but... did they ask????""

so i guess you could call this my intro to this community. also, i've never used reddit before just wanted to preface that for some reason (evidence: this is me re-posting this because i didn't know there was a certain title ""template"" you had to follow when creating a post...)

i kind of just want my thoughts to be heard, or in this case, to be seen. it seems to be more relieving to know that strangers are getting a look at the thoughts in my head and not the people that im actually close with in my life. ive been searching for a way to do this for a while now--i even tried using tumblr but its harder to really get yourself out there, you know what i mean?

if you're reading this, thanks :) you're dope.

random question now that you've read the whole thing (im assuming): can you guess how old i am by the way i wrote/typed this? (is that possible lol)"
"I breathe for the first time after a marathon of endless chaos. Catching my breath as I clumsily clasp at the water tank to quench my endless thirst. Looking back briefly at where I'd just escaped, seeing who was left, and who was still here with me. Peering over a cliff's edge with a forceful and raging waterfall angrily pounding the body of water seated 30 feet below. Cautiously gazing over the ledge, I was perched like a curious baby bird. Do I jump, or continue to endure the exhaustion that reddened my face like sizzling barbecue meat awaiting their final fates ever so patiently. No one was still here, they had all left and went in another direction. If i did jump, I would be the target of the waterfalls fury and would be wildly plunged with such tremendous force, it will be like a small child trying to tame a wild raging bull. I can't just stay here in limbo, sometimes in life, you have to make big changes.

Before I decide, I lie down in the meadow where a wall of summer trees envelop a private backyard in an old tattered but charming house. Bees buzz by busily baking breakfast honey. Creaky doors and paint-peeled windows should repel any burglars, here should be safe. At least for the time being. The mammoth of stress the past 4 years has brought me has been intense and relentless, I just need a wee rest before the chaos that awaits me. I close my eyes and am smothered in a sea of memories, still fresh like recently squeezed breakfast orange juice.

What I see now is the crazy episodes where we had run amock in a flurry of stress and now the once solid cliff face was giving way to landslides. I anxiously step back and allow myself to let my guard down as rocks spillover to their ultimate doom. I will need to be rested for the mission that tomorrow will bring. Try and think of positive memories as I enter a half-awake half-asleep state of consciousness.

Several months of fighting for survival, and now in this unconscious state I am rewarded with momentary rest. The laughs, the joint celebrations, the endless chats and taking on life together. Where is all that now? Gone! Texting for nearly 7 months, then one day I guess you decided to cut the ties, and take on life completely without me. I suppose you thought life is better that way. I understand. Other people who I've shared life's journey with try and invade space in my mind, sadly for them that is mission impossible. I smile inside and out and perhaps this is the end of the road, as where would we go if we stayed in contact? My mind forms false memories to comfort my heart like fine silk bed-linen on a soft mattress. The 7 months is over now, and the only constant is change. I gotta move on.

I awake out of my slumber, refreshed and accepting the past 7 months and fully prepared for the fact I may never see you again. I gain strength from the positive times we have had and am now looking forward back over that cliff face. Too high to just wing a jump, I piece a rope and tie it around a thick sturdy evergreen tree. Abseiling is now my only option like some crazed adrenaline adventure junkie, I take 3 deep breaths and begin the descent.

As my body lowers and the placement of my feet securely stabilize my position. The world that was my life for the past 7 months slowly disappears and vanishes from visibility.  Down, down down I go. As I'm half-way down, I hear the voice of a young woman echo and ricochet off the back face of the cliff positioned behind me. I don't know if I can get back up to follow the voice, or if I'd just have to dismiss the familiar tone as my imagination.

Dreams and life can be so similar. I don't know which one I like better."

Music - N/A

Wow it has been a long time hasn't it?

Im back at uni in my second year and due to cover were in another lockdown. As much as i like to kid myself into believing that its not affecting me that much i have has a bit of a breakdown over the past 2 days where i was binging ""Sherlock"" as a form of escapism, ie to emerge myself in a fictional world to forget about this one. Ive had 2 almost sleepless nights and woke up at 1PM on both occasions.

Moreover today in the shower i turned off the lights, turned up the music (shout louder) and started scratching myself i don't really know why but i couldn't bring myself to stop. I scraped my nails along my skin to feel the fleeting sting of pain and to know that i would mark my body (I don't understand this, i think it is so that the turmoil that i feel can be seen by me and by anyone who looks close enough). I have a bite mark on my left hand and some lingering scratch marks on both forearms and chest. The worst part might be that i don't want to directly stop this behaviour as i know that it is stress induced.

Stress from work, stress from losing all of my friends from physics, stress from being far behind in the course because fuck online teaching and loneliness I've only got one friend who i actually talk to (barney M obviously) because he and Dan are the only people who I've spoken to for a very long time.

I actually started tinder a couple weeks ago but i find it so hard to come up with replies to multiple people as well as trying to be entertaining so i just ""air"" them out of fear. it doesn't help that my bio is still sexualised when my ideal outcome is a coffee date or something. I should probably get back to my impossible homework now..."
"As I was working at the shop on a project with my mom, we were discussing the election and what we thought was going to happen.

Now mind you, it was early in the day and the tally had not been completed yet. We were in the back part of our large shop, in the workshop area, the gallery up front where my brother was getting things ready to open shop. We had the back door ajar to vent fumes out like we do each day.

Because we keep the back door open we have had several unusual experiences since first moving locations.

And that day was very strange.

As I was talking about the tally at that time, a scraggly looking woman, with far too much makeup on and reeking of something unfamiliar to me but stinking to the highest heaven whatever drug it was, kicked the door back as far as it would go resulting in a screeching sound as it raked against the pavement demanding that we ""shut your filthy whore mouths!""

Then she demanded to know if we were Democratic or Liberal.

In hindsight I may have overreacted.

By a lot.

It has been a difficult time for us while dealing with financial strain and the loss of a loved one and so... I snapped.

""I'm a fuckin' people unlike you, you psychotic deranged lunatic! Get the fuck out before I drop you!""

Now, when I am in peak rage my voice rumbles a bit. I have been called a monster all my life because of the change in my voice while enraged.

And my roar at the woman was loud enough my brother came running ready to brawl while my mom put herself between us.

She took one look at him, and he is a frightful sight when mad, and just left back the way she came as though her ass was aflame.

So now I am not allowed to be at the shop anymore until this business of putting my aunt to rest calms down."
"I can't write english paragraph or essay well. Since I start writing, I feel afraid of wrong grammar or no idea of what should I write about. I believe I have ideas but I can't pull it out and write it on paper."
"My head feels funny. I really need to see a doctor, but we're going to begin the onboarding of a new employee on Monday and the Professor really wants me to be there to walk her through. It's funny, you know, I didn't think I'd be the one training someone. I mean, I have done it before with previous jobs, but never independently like this.

My boss is confident I'll do well with this new addition to the team, though I think he puts too much faith into me. I know I sound like I'm disrespecting him, but that's not it. I am extremely grateful for him bringing me in when I was in such a low place, but now with this turnover period still in effect, he's giving more than I can chew. It'll look great for my resume and any reference letters, sure, but it's mentally and physically taxing me more than ever.

And he knows this. He knows that I'm doing the best I can and I don't think he would've entrusted me if he didn't have confidence in my abilities. That, of course, and I'm the only person now who holds seniority in this position. You know, because everyone else left. Yeah, it sucks, but it doesn't suck so bad to the point where I'm going to jump ship. That would be stupid anyway; I still have to make money. And without solid references and beefing up my resume further, I won't stand a chance in finding another, much more lucrative position, after this.

Today was pretty dead. Cases are rising up again over here, and the fact that it's Election Day means that not too many people came into work. At least, from what I saw. 

The governor is planning on moving back into Phase 2 if this keeps up. It doesn't surprise me, honestly, but I wish things would get better sooner than later. I'm sure it won't be as bad as it was back in March, but who knows at this point.

The garage I park at for my daily commute is undergoing construction. The structural engineers are gonna need at least a month, according to them, to evaluate and repair anything necessary. In the meantime, they've temporarily opened an old spiral driveway for motorists to use while they do their job. The driveway looks like it hasn't seen use in years, though they claim it's safe to use. It's kind of creepy driving at night, and because that section of the garage lacks any mounted lights, someone could be walking on it and you wouldn't know it until the very last second, if you're not careful, that is.

A lot of shrubbery has grown around it, while the walls of the spiral are coated with graffiti and tags. A lot of homeless folks, I'm told, frequent that section of the garage so I should be careful in my driving.

Anyway, that's all I can muster to write for now.

Goodnight."
"It hasn't been long since I gave you some advice for your day to day life. I hope you're putting them to good use. There might be people trying to put you down for anything and everything you do or say. It's a bit funny right? How people waste their energy and time on you like that. There's nothing more to think of it when it comes to that. Take that as an example for how you shouldn't be. Constant negative people can damage you mentally and emotionally if you let them. But you have power and control. Keep living your life the way you enjoy it the most. At the end, you'll be happier, calmer, and more at peace. I hope these are the words you wanted to hear to soothe your heart.

Z.Z.H."
"Will my feelings and problems matter months from now? Years? I wish someone would tell me all the things I need to hear. I want to learn all the things I can. I want to know the right thing to say. I don't want to be anxious. I want to smile even more, even wider. And years from now, I want to take a deep breath and tell myself my problems then don't matter now after all. That everything will be okay. You can only live one day at a time, only from morning until bedtime. That you won't get to live for eternity, but to enjoy the time you have now, one day at a time. To enjoy everyday for yourself. It's okay. Were these the things you wanted to hear to soothe your heart? I hope so. 

Z.Z.H."
"It's been a month today since you left. To say it's been hard is an understatement. You were officially my son-in-law for only a handful of months but you called me Mom from the first night I met you. B (your wife) went into a horribly scary downward spiral after the morning she found you in the parking lot of the church sitting in your car unresponsive and cold. I still remember the sound of her dad's voice at 700 on that Sunday morning. Although you two weren't to impressed with the other his heart was breaking for his little girl. We knew this was definitely going to change her forever.
The last time i saw you was at the scene while the police investigated. From where I was standing you looked like you were asleep. But you weren't. 
They found the gun on passenger seat which was odd for someone who had taken their life. To me meant that you didn't go instantly. It took a minute or two. You were looking at the picture of B you kept on your dash. 

I still get anxious and overwhelmingly sad when I go past the church where you were found. I used to be able to mindlessly drive to the apartment you shared with my daughter and my two beautiful grandbabies. Now it seems I'm hyper-aware of turning down that street. I'm instantly back to that morning, standing outside of the police tape looking at you in your car. 

I met your mother, father, step father and brother a little over 48 hours after you were found. I completely understood why you were so drawn to me and my family within the first 5 minutes. You had finally known what it meant to be part of a loving, supportive family. We had our issues, we had our arguments and would distance ourselves at times but we never walked away. In the 29 years you were on this earth, I was the only person who had ever been upset with you but not verbally abuse, scream at or threaten you. You always knew that even if I was upset with you about one of the many issues there were in your relationship with my daughter and the drinking, that in a few days I'd be there to talk to you about my concerns. I did see you try to do and be better. I think it just got to be too much for you. 

At almost 3 years old, C talks about you often. He says he sees you a lot. It wasnt long after you were gone he fell asleep holding your picture. L, suddenly began waking up in the middle of the night laughing and jumping in her crib, whereas before she would immediately cry if she woke up. 

A lot of songs I hear have a new meaning to me now and I find myself tearing up at random times during the day when something I see or hear reminds me of you. 

I've got the pictures you emailed up in the living room. C likes to look at them when he's over. 

It's cold, rainy and gray outside this morning, it seems fitting. 

No one is sure why you made the decisions you made that night. I guess we never will. I know you're finally at peace though. And I know you're still with B and the kids, which is the only place you wanted to be. 

I don't know how her story ends, I just know that in that one instant her life was forever changed, as was mine and many others. I've never lost someone so close to me in such a sad and tragic way. I think the fact that you are the one who took yourself away is the hardest to cope with. You didn't have a terminal physical disease, there was no accident. You were the who pulled the trigger that night. In my heart I think you did it in the most compassionate way possible and all the little things that happened since tells me you did what you felt you had to do. But you're not going anywhere. 

I know you're at peace now. I wanted to put a candle in the church parking lot for you tonight but I don't think I can go into that parking lot just yet. I can barely drive passed it. Eventually, maybe I can but not yet."
"My lab partner is leaving. Yeah, remember the guy who's been on vacation? He's leaving for good afterwards. And wouldn't you know it, the same coworker who informed me that my mentor was leaving, unceremoniously, also was the one who just informed me that my lab partner is quitting...unceremoniously.

This **sucks**. We do, fortunately, have a newcomer joining us by the first week or second week of November, but guess who has to train them? Me. And, on top of that, I have to now take **all the goddamned responsibilities that my former coworker had**. Wonderful. I still haven't gotten a raise yet, either.

This is getting too much for me. I'm about to leave within 6 months if this doesn't improve. Seriously, I can only take so much before losing my freaking mind. In addition, it looks like cases of the virus are going back up again. This is thanks in part to the imbeciles who still haven't listened to the experts.

I should start thinking about updating my resume and looking into jobs.

The worst part of all of this is that he didn't even tell me he was leaving. I know it's not my business if he leaves or not, but the least he could've done is give me a heads up so that we can change our schedule. He didn't even give the Professor a 2-week notice; just waltzed into his office and told him he would be leaving.

Great. Just fucking great. I'm going to be running around even more now because of this. I swear, I'll be going just as insane as my former P.I., maybe even worse.

Fuck 2020."
"Feeling frustrated. Need to vent.

I have ADHD, Depression and now have been diagnosed with Anxiety.

The most effective treatment for me is IV Ketamine which costs a lot of money. 

I figure maybe I can just bust my butt but then I think ""but... I can barely do the bare minimum in my life. How am I going to bust behind for probably 4 weeks straight??"" 

I feel stuck and trapped. I can't qualify to borrow the resources. 

I'm thinking I could maybe power through with use of ADHD meds in the morning, CBD oils at night. Maybe. I mean... man, worth a try."
"I’m actually feeling hopeful, if incredibly anxious, about maybe a date tonight?

I wrote here that at beginning of quarantine my long time gf and I broke up, and since then I’ve just been alone and I haven’t thought about seeing anyone. Also the pandemic makes it difficult, and being completely virtual for college also give road blocks to making friends in general. 

But at the beginning of the week I started talking to a girl in one of my classes and it seems to be going well?? I’m incredibly nervous. Also, I didn’t expect the type of convos or reciprocation at all. Like I did not expect to go on a date at all, and that’s what scares me. 

I don’t know if this is a date
Or a booty call thing
Or just being friends

Like it could be any. So I’m very nervous, but I’m also really excited because she’s super super sweet and kind and beautiful and hilarious so I don’t know. And also I didn’t want to go on dates. I didn’t want to date for a while, but I sorta have a crush on this girl and that FREAKS ME THE FUCK OUT. 

also my ex is really good friends with the girls roommate so that might be problematic, yet to be addressed. 

I think it might be a date because we have had some flirty moments, but again, I just don’t know. 

Either way, I’m excited. New friends a new friend. 

Song of the Day: Dead End Lovers by Richard Walters"
"It's been a couple of days since my last entry but honestly not much has changed. I had a bad day, my mind kept going back to her that day for some reason and I wrote her a letter. I don't think she will ever read it but at least it's there if she ever wanders across my page. My mind has been a war zone lately, different wants and thoughts fighting against each other for my attention, I need to get better at controlling my mind. 

Anyways, today was a good day. I had lunch with a friend at the restaurant in downtown. We sat and talked for a while, I realize that I am not good with conversation when it is with people I know because I don't really go and do much. I think I need to go an experience life a lot more. I need to go out and make my own stories, instead of waiting for the perfect time. 

It's late here and I have work tomorrow. 

\-Love always,

J."
"Sorry for not writing in a while, I decided to take a break from journaling for a bit because it started to feel like a chore. I wrote everyday for months and months in my little journal and it was only in the last couple of weeks I realized I stopped enjoying the process of writing these. I realized I didn’t care at that point to put any effort into it at all. But I’m back because I feel like I want to write again and that I do enjoy looking back and remembering these moments. 

Honestly I also stopped writing because my (ex)Best friend told me never to contact her again and that she hate(d) me. It cut deep for a few days and then it stopped. It finally sunk in and I just accepted it for what it was, I felt free from my burden of wallowing in my own self pity. I could either hold that pain and use it as an excuse or I could use the pain as a tool to make me a better and happier person overall in the future. 

I had a good day today, I played among us with some of my colleagues from work which was fun. I do enjoy working there and while it is a different work environment and vibe compared to my old work I think I have grown to enjoy talking to the people as well. Slowly but surely becoming part of my everyday life. 

I have let myself go a little bit, bringing back some old bad habits. But overall I’m on the up and up. 

-love always,
J."
"Hey guys, I just wanted to say that after my many years of research I have finally come to the conclusion that god fucking hates my guts.

So, let’s start with when my sister picked me up. It was around 4:13 pm. We first went to target and picked up some stuff. Then we headed back to the house for 10 mins to get settled. Then we went to Starbucks and went for a walk. I taught her how to do all of the aesthetic iOS 14 widget stuff too. 

It was around 7 pm when we started to walk back to the car, so it was pretty dark. Then it happened. Everything was perfect until this happened.

I tripped. 

I landed on my thumb, and I was holding my phone which fell face first into the ground.

Fuck.

That was the straw that broke the camels back. I started to tear up. Then I told my sister about what our mom has been saying to me. And *very* surprisingly she told me it was ok to cry.

Then while we were on our way home she told me she’s seeing a therapist. That made me cry tears of joy(which I held back bc I didn’t want her to ask why I was crying harder.) 

Man I’m just so happy and proud. Idk how long she’s been seeing the therapist, but I can already see she’s making tremendous progress. I just really want to thank the therapist for helping so much.

Well, this *might* just be the ending of my sister’s temper tantrums. This has been a hell of a roller coaster.

Also, thank god for phone cases and screen protectors. My screen protector is shattered on the bottom left side, and only a little bit of my actual phone was scraped. It’s noticeable, but small. And my thumb did get really hurt. It’s alright now though because my sister cleaned it up and put a band aid on it for me.

I hope my life will continue to move in a positive direction."
"Today was my first day working the floor (still shadowing a more experienced person for most of the day) and I find that I get nervous talking to customers because my knowledge of the products isn't the best. I do think that I will get better over time as the products and materials used in the products become more ingrained in my memory so that I can recommend different types of fabrics and cuts to customers coming through the store. Either way I do hope I get less shy and be a little more outgoing when customer facing. 

Other than getting nervous today was a good day. I was up wayyyy late last night and I really could have used more rest so that I could have been my best self while at work but ultimately it was a good night. Sometimes it's nice to just go out, get ice cream, go to a viewpoint of the big city and just think out-loud. 

I realized that despite a lot of the sad things going on in my life I still have a lot of happy things too. And that despite the fact that some things are sad I can still choose to focus on the happy things that surround me and that I can choose to be happy. I like being happy and I think it will be good for me to think less and just be a more intrinsically happy person.

Anyways, it is late again and I should sleep. 

\-Love always,

J."
"Hi,
I'm living in Czechia, so english it's not my first language, sorry.


So, this story, for full context, starts at the start of the year. I've just broke from a 2 months epic relationship (best girl at the worst time), losed my job and was just depressed at home with just first education of 9 years (then you go to middle school of 4 years and then hight school (uni))

Then, I've started to work at a new job (similar to FedEx for companies) for an above average salary (25k CZK into my pocket every month).

I got back up on my feet and reevaluated what I would like to do in life. So, after two months working there, I've quit and started a new job at KFC (start of March). I wanted to be a manager and make some difference, accomplish something in my life, you know...

After my first month there, corona striked and we had only drive-thru window. After 2 months of working there for 16k CZK into my pocket every month, I've started to smoke weed and made some friends at work (I was a lot more introverted so I haven't had any friends back then).
At 4 months in there, we've changed management, had a new people and general managers came in and from there everything started to go down. We were now open 7-23 not nonstop anymore and had open restaurant again.

They've been strict for smoking marijuana (it's not legal here) and I've had some bad encounters with them.

So we were already starting at the bad note.

Jumpcut to some bad encounters, some problems at work and now, we're here, like last week.

I've had another encounter and they've took away 1k from my next salary (I need to work like 8 hours for 1k CZK). I was furious and started to consider leaving KFC. Pay was bad, because of encounters I couldn't be a manager, they wouldn't let me.

Then, my mom found out that like 2 miles from my home they've build a Mall and a new mcdonald's is built there.

So today, I've should've been at work from 12 o'clock and end at 23:30. But I was at an interview for that mcdonald's. They've said to me that they will consider me, but they don't know how would they look at my last work (KFC). 

So I've been late to a job (came at 15 o'clock), but I was tired and walked like a sack of potatoes. So I was a cashier and asked my manager if he will find a replacement for me. Then, at 18:15 I got recommended energy drink, cause I don't drink coffee. So I went to a gas station for a monster, took a sip and immediately I was feeling really bad and wanted to puke, but haven't. I got back to my manager and told him that I will be going home at 7 pm (it was 6:30 pm) and that he will better find a replacement for me, cause we had a really small number of workers low as that.

Anyway, he found a replacement, but for an eight, so I've stayed and waited for an eight.

Now, I will be losing this job (KFC) at the end of a month, signed up the papers, at Monday I will know if mcdonald's chooses me and then, I will slowly lose my friends, cause everyone I have is from work and I'm like that.
Corona is starting in my country again, so I'm afraid that mcdonald's could've just get rid of me if they close restaurants like the first time.

I don't know why, maybe I've just wanted to express myself to somebody, but nobody will read it anyways...

Thanks for listening to my ted talk 
Bye"
"Or at least I was definitely going to die unless I had doctors to save me. I am so happy for life yet somehow I am also mad. Mad at all my friends who watched me dying on snapchat and didn't express any concern. People who claim to be my friends, sitting there watching my life pass. It's sickening and infuriating.  I never ask for much, but if there was one day to reach out to me today was the fucking day when I was dying. Even strangers or people I wouldn't consider my friends reached out and offered their support which was far beyond anything I could've imagined. Is it really that hard to reach out to someone or do they not care about me? I honestly don't care at this point. I am over it, over investing in people who would literally watch me die it's despicable. I don't care who you are but if you see someone dying you should care, regardless of who they are.  Anyway, time to do some ""spring cleaning"" and I would love to tell all the people I cared about off but I feel like they wouldn't even care anyway. They already watched me dying without any issue. You sick fucks, I won't be your death porn."
"I don’t really know where to start. I feel so bored and hollow. Walking makes me happy. I try to walk a few miles everyday, and it’s hard when I’m following the path uphill. It’s a struggle because I haven’t been active since I lost my job. But going downhill makes me happy. It’s like the path just carries me down and I feel the cool breeze that isn’t there when I’m walking uphill. I feel the sun shining directly on my face and it’s nice even though I can barely see. It’s almost like the path is rewarding me for the couple miles I walked uphill. That good feeling lasts about an hour, and then I sit with my thoughts all day. I miss working. 

I really wish I could love myself. I just had a heartbreaking moment because I was thinking about stuff. I don’t deserve my family. I don’t deserve my friends. I don’t want to eat anymore because I feel like I don’t even deserve food. I want to be more fragile for everyone so they will see me and want to be nicer to me. I want to look how I feel on the inside. I want to relapse. My friends threw a surprise party for my best friend recently, and it’s because she’s a great friend and she deserves the world. She is always there for everyone but im not there for anyone except for her. But it made me realize that nobody would plan something like that for me unless it was only her doing it. And I barely think about anyone but myself. Anyway, when I was thinking about how I don’t want to eat anymore and how I want to relapse again it made me realize that I kind of hate myself. I really want to love myself. If I’m not there for anyone else I should at least be there for myself. But I don’t deserve it. 

My relationship with my mom isn’t so good. I can’t tell her about how I feel because she thinks it’s her fault and it burdens her. I can’t talk to her about anything else because I can never tell her how I feel. It’s a vicious cycle that keeps getting worse. I’ve been short with my parents for such a long time but I feel like I can’t talk about anything other than how much I hurt. I love my grandma but every time I go see her, all she talks about is how much I don’t see her. That’s funny, right after I wrote this she came over. I told her about how I’m not happy in my relationship and how I gained weight lol. She said she understands and that she couldn’t leave her ex boyfriend either. I don’t think I’ll be able to find better though. He makes me happy for the most part, but he spends way too much time on his computer. I haven’t touched mine in like 2 weeks but he has trouble staying away for an hour. 

I feel a little better after I talked to my grandma, she makes things feel brighter. I should go see her soon. 

Now I’ll probably go do my homework and try to start exercising since I always put it off. Hopefully I’ll be able to fit into my jeans again soon. I’ve been doing a calorie deficit diet thing and it’s weird counting all of the calories. It makes me feel obsessed. I know I should just be focused on eating healthier and exercising. I shouldn’t be too focused on losing weight I guess, I just want to feel healthier. But at the same time I want abs haha. And I want to be able to button my damn jeans. Okay yeah that’s all for today."
"Today I finished up all my computer training at my new job, I didn't spend any time on the floor. It was nice to be able to go home and just relax for a while. I was supposed to grab dinner with a friend, but he bailed so I ended up grabbing dinner with another friend. It's nice having people to talk to outside of the normal group that I hang around, it lends me a fresh perspective on what it is that I am going through. I ended up just sitting around for a few hours thinking about my life and my hopes and dreams for the future. I stayed out till late walking around downtown under the stars. Looking at the beauty of mundane life. The beauty in the simplicity of happiness. 

I ended up thinking I am a Ted Mosby, always looking for love but never working on it. Never realizing that true love doesn't happen in an instant, but instead it takes work... that if you are going to love someone it means never giving up and that you keep working through the issues. I think most people can fall in love with someone, given enough time, but staying in love with someone takes effort. Love isn't effortless, nothing in life is, and that's what the movies and books get wrong. They don't show the messy bits, they don't show the hard work of forgiveness and of change that happens. Because everyone changes, loving someone is loving them through their journey in life and sticking beside them. Even if it means that you have to take a step back sometimes to give them space to figure out what it is that they want for themselves. 

I always end up losing that battle, the battle of knowledge vs patience. I always want to know things right away, and that's not how we make decisions. At least not the decisions that we make when we are clear and level headed. I need to be more patient, and I need to understand that everything takes time... especially forgiveness for past actions. 

Anyways, tomorrow I think I'll take a morning to myself. One so that I can reflect after sleeping on my problems and my wants. A morning so that I can try and find myself in a more level headed position to make decisions and talk about them openly without fear of making the wrong decisions. 

\-Love always,

J."
"Hi there, I'm not really sure why I'm writing this journal entry... I'm not sure if it's because I just need a place to get my thoughts out, or maybe I just need a place to write without worry. Anyways. Today was an interesting day, I started my new job. It was weird... I still can't believe after all of this time I quit my old job, I had so many friends and so many memories there and now that chapter of my life is just over. I think it was good to change jobs and locations of places I will constantly be. After I lost her there were too many memories attached to that location and only now am I starting to really get over her. It's kind of funny, I wanted to text her again. Tell her everything that is going on in my life. I mean I quit my job and I got a new one in a couple of days. It would have been one of those things that I would have told her about... it's funny how someone is such an integral part of your everyday routine and then all of a sudden they just aren't there anymore.

Anyways, my first day was good. I mainly worked on online learning modules. I am a bit worried that it will be too confusing when I start actually working the floor, but I know I'll pull through. Tomorrow they have me working the floor, actually tomorrow and Sunday... I finish my training Monday, so they must have really needed people. I guess that's why I got hired almost immediately.

After work I hung out with my friend and his dog, it was fun catching up. I hear more people jumped ship and quit at my old store, and I mean good for them it was getting really crazy and stressful. I do wish them luck in finding new jobs.

It's late and I can't sleep. I keep going over the memories with her. It's always the little things that remind me of her, and I still see them everywhere. I guess it's getting less frequent, but sometimes something catches me off guard. Someones glasses, a song, a strangers laugh. All of it sometimes just reminding me of what I lost. But it does happen less frequently now. I used to see her in everything, and now it happens a couple of times a day where I catch myself thinking of her. Eventually I hope nothing will remind me of her, at least that I won't get sad whenever something does. Because I know I'm young, and I know I will move on. Right now I need to live my life and get better. But damn do I miss her. I know I won't reach out, I don't even have her phone number anymore. But sometimes I wish that I would wake up and I would see a text from her.

\- love always

"Guess I have no choice to carry my physical journal since I've been so busy with life, so might as well write here, right? Better than nothing.Quarantine is killing me, and it's killing my family. My boss threw a bloody tissue at my head just because he's mad while I'm trying to do some work, I have a doctors appointment, and I have other things to do then just to do his own tasks (wow, sorry if I scheduled my appointment about 5 months in advance), and my family is crumbling apart. All my mom and dad do is scream at each other: dad is a control freak with anger issues, mom has anxiety issues with emotional mood swings which she can't control (I'm 90% sure she's also bipolar-she shows signs of mania episodes). They refuse to see a marriage counselor and always scream about getting a divorce...and I have a weird, sneaking suspicion that my dad could be cheating on my mom. I could be wrong though.

I'm just so fed up with today, and it's ONLY MONDAY. I'm sure the rest of the week will just be downhill crap of my controlling father who constantly bothers me and my mom, my sister who's financially irresponsible and put us more into debt...I don't have anything to say.

It's only monday. Help. Don't know how I'm going to manage to get through the rest of this week."
"Lately it feels like time doesn't exist, definitely a by-product of covid. Like the morning bleeds into afternoon into evening. Sometimes I feel like maybe I don't even exist anymore!

I work from home and lately the projects I'm working on seem to go nowhere. This is partially on me and I could step up the game in holding myself to more structure and being more productive. But I'm just not motivated!

And I'm so tired. Like all the time. I'm well rested, luckily sleeping well. But I don't have the urge to do a lot. I think if I was interacting more with people in-person that would change, but that's not really on the table with covid. In part because most of my friends are online or live too far away to spend time together IRL. So it's not the best time to be making new friends, or going to a space with people around to socialize in a more open way.

I'm just venting. Luckily this feeling isn't getting me stuck in some depression - though I've dealt with some depressive episodes over the last few months.

I'm sticking with my routine, going to bed around the same time every day, waking up at roughly the same time every day. I'm doing yoga daily. And meditating daily. Going for walks daily. Occasional bike rides. In many ways, I shouldn't complain. I just feel so pent up!

This weekend I'm going to try to actually rest and do things I enjoy. I've been letting work blend into weekend because I'm lazy during the week. Having \*some\* structure can only help, right? I'd like to pot some plants, finally fix my car battery... maybe go for a hike? Oh and clean the house. Maybe I'll do that now, Friday evening clean - set myself up for a nice weekend.

Thanks for listening, first post here. Probably more to come!"
"I blocked my half-brother on Facebook. I had enough of him. He started blowing and going in my Facebook comments about how the pandemic was a hoax, and the sooner I learned that, the better. No worse than the flu, he said, and that it was over-exaggerated. And with my every reply, he started getting more aggressive. He said that if I was afraid of dying, I might as well shrivel up under a rock, and to live for action and danger, not safety. And then, somehow, the Jewish and Nazis got into the mix, and that pretty much made me not want to deal with him any longer. I blocked him.

Keep in mind, this is the guy that drugged and kidnapped his own daughter when she was younger, was dishonorably discharged from the Marines for an incident in Tijuana regarding a woman, possibly going AWOL for a while during his time with said Marines, and tried to run some kids down with his truck while drunk during a rather bad disagreement about TPing the school. How is he not under watch? I don't know. America. His charges as an offender were apparently dropped. Dad continues to defend him, because he strongly believes that he would ""never turn his kids away when they need help"". My half-brother needed a place to stay again after his second wife dropped him like a bad habit and her foster parents decided to probably sell the house.

The offender thing I could've maybe forgiven, as my boyfriend has made his own mistakes ""back in the day"". But now that I really, really think about things, and have the space to make a decision about my half-brother for myself? ...I guess talking to his daughter really made me do a double-take. His daughter still has PTSD from that whole ordeal, but she's trying to seek counseling for it and is going to college in New Mexico. She wants to become a social worker at a school.

My boyfriend told me, himself, ""You're finally doing well. I'm working again, all your tests came back negative at the doctor's – things are going WELL for you. You don't need that kind of negativity in your life. I'd suggest blocking him."" Between him and D, a good friend of mine, I decided to. A quote from someone resonated with me:

""I will be mean now, so if you don't expect mean from me right now, close your eyes.""

D is so happy to see someone on my side like my boyfriend, who can give me the support I need. He has his quirks sometimes, and he does have a temper, but he tries to be a good person. The world hasn't been good to him, which has made him more than a little cynical, but there's a side of him not a lot of people get to see. That good side that makes me fall in love with him again and again. I'm one of his biggest fans and could talk about him for hours. I told him I told D he was more than I ever expected in my life. I think he scoffed.

""I may be more than you expected, but less than you deserve."" He walked out of the bedroom to get some food, ignoring my whimper of ""No...."" He breaks my heart sometimes with that talk, because he doesn't know how valuable he is to me, and how he's saved my life. Thanks to him, I've lived longer than I've sometimes thought I should've, or wanted to."
"So, everything was completely fine just 20 mins ago. It was really quiet too. You could have probably heard a pin drop.

Anyways, now my sister is randomly angry. She is slamming doors and yelling a bit. Now I'm considering just going home tomorrow. I don't want to deal with my sisters anger issues. It just reminds me of my dad."
"So, earlier today my dad said he is coming by for dinner. After my siblings came back from shopping my mom told them and they left. 

My sister was ok with it as long as he doesn't go near her room. My brother wasn't ok with it at all.

My dad arrived a few minutes ago. He sat down at the table and started asking my mom and I questions. I started smiling. I don't know why I smiled. I've heard that it's a defense mechanism.

Anyways they went outside to talk. They came back in a few minutes later and we started eating dinner.

I think my dad was trying to manipulate me by asking my mom if she ""told him to get a 1 bedroom apartment."" And he kept on asking her that until she answered.

Then he started targeting all of the questions to me. He asked me things like ""Do you want your mother and I to get divorced?"" 

""Do you think it would be better if your mother and I got divorced?""

And I answered, ""With how the family is now, yes.""

And then he started saying how I was trying to break them up and get in the way of their love. The thing is that they should have gotten divorced 4 years ago.

A lot of the other stuff we talked about is slipping my mind already.

Anyways, my parents are outside arguing now. I'll update once other events unfold.

(10:12 pm) Update: My parents came back inside, talked for a few minutes and my dad left."
"Shadowed
Last night I was told by a MAN that I hadn’t really been “sexually assaulted.” After sharing with this guy I trust and call one of my best friends (really the first time I’ve actually talked about it out loud to someone) about some of the things I’ve gone through over the years, I was given all of these reasons and excuses as to why what happened to me “wasn’t really technically sexual assault.” Instance after instance, he justified and excused my different abusers actions. I was so sad and confused, literally just fighting the urge to cry the entire conversation; trying to come up with the right words to discredit the points he was attempting to make. I could feel myself slipping in to the dark shadows; unheard and unseen. I finally gave up and just listened while nodding my head; eventually the conversation passed since I wasn’t fighting back on the topic anymore I guess. I literally cried the whole drive home. I woke up at 3am and fucking cried again. It’s almost 1:00pm and I’m still in bed feeling sad as shit. But thanks for your opinion I guess... I know my stories, I know the facts, I know the truth. Feel free to check out the link below if you’d like to educate yourself on sexual assault. 
https://www.rainn.org/articles/sexual-assault"
"So, things were actually going well yesterday. My brother told me that if I wanted any new stuff for my room he would buy it. I decided on a new desk and bed frame. I also decided which monitor I want, the ASUS tuf vg249q.

Now, everything went to shit. My dad wanted my brother to apologize to him. My brother responded by saying ""I'm sorry that I yelled at you and you're hurt by that."" Or something along those lines.

This sparked a *huge* fight. My dad started yelling saying that my brother can't talk to him like that because he's the dad. My brother yells back saying that he doesn't care and that he doesn't  want him anywhere near the cats. 

Then they started fighting about how my dad cleaned the litter box. My dad said that he has the right to clean the litter box because he paid for the house and that he has allergies. They just kept screaming back and forth.

Some time during the argument both my parents came into my room, closed my door, and started screaming at each other right in front of me. I felt like a ghost.

Now my brother and sister are leaving with the cats to go to the ""A"" house. I'll be joining them during the weekend.

I just really *need* to talk to my therapist."
"I've been informed that our government is planning on moving into another part of the Phase 2 reopening. Well, we're already in Phase 2, but by tomorrow, they plan on reopening many retail stores throughout the state. I have no idea how they're going to make this work, and even more so, I have no  idea how they'll control the influx of shoppers going into their favorite stores. There's a mall, close to where I live, and it is one of the largest complexes here. They're planning on opening on Wednesday, but how they'll manage that is beyond me.

In the meantime, I've continuing my work onsite. There's nothing much else to say, other than us slowly reviving all lab operations. Unfortunately, it's been nothing but tedious and headache-inducing. Since so many other labs and their staff share space and equipment with us, trying to social distance while doing our work is impractical and, in most instances, almost impossible. We're required to wear masks from the start to the end of our shift, but even then I fail to see its usefulness when we're all clumped up in the same sharing space anyway.

Scheduling to use certain spaces and equipment throughout the facility and other areas of the hospital sucks. It just plain sucks. I've been juggling between doing my duties and trying to get a grasp on adapting to this new work style. I still can't believe this is all happening so quickly. One of my coworkers, the Doctor, told me that we'll need to ""fight tooth and nail"" if we want to get our procedures done. And, all the while this is going on, my paycheck has remained the same.

That's something else that's been on my mind. You see, September will be my work anniversary, and while I've been grateful to my coworkers around me, I really don't see an increase in my pay, especially with this ongoing pandemic. I was planning on staying for a maximum of 2 years, but I may have to think about putting in a 2-week notice, maybe, after a year and a half on this job. Thing is, working for another year after this one would really bolster my C.V. I was thinking of taking a second job, but with all that's going on right now, there's just no way it's happening.

I'm very worried about job security, more than ever. While I would love to explore other opportunities, I'm scared I'll be trapped into another round of job hunting (literally, hell on Earth) and getting nothing out of it. You have no idea how difficult it was to secure a job like this, even if the pay is abysmal. Getting extremely strong references after having rendered a lot of time into this job will absolutely help.

I hope I don't get burnt out from all of this. I'm taking so many risks being exposed to the general public, and they to me. I've seen people not wearing masks or not wearing them properly. And, for whatever reason, there are those who think this is a joke. We're not out of the woods yet. There is still an ongoing global pandemic, and until a majority of the population is immunized, we can't let our guard down, lest we *go back to quarantine again*. 

I don't feel well about all of this. I wish there was some other way."
"So, my brother went to pick up the kittens on the 23rd. Their names are Apollo and Rex.

Anyways, my dad has cat allergies and apparently my sister and brother doesn't want my dad to play with them, but he decides that it's okay to play with them anyways when my siblings aren't looking.

I saw my dad playing with them then he asks me to not tell my siblings. He made sure he heard me say ok. This is so fucking annoying. It's like he thinks we're on good terms or something.

Ever since I was like 9 I was everyone's confidant. My mom or sister would ask me questions about my dad then they would tell me not to tell him. Then my dad would do the same thing, but a lot more often.

I'm so tired of this."
"Today, I dreamed of being the woman I thought I am and never was. 

It was winter and gloomy. I didn't know exactly what was going on but there's one thing I know for sure. I was living by myself in some house apartment I think. Until that winter day, that man came. We became friends and have been seeing like we've known each other since. Then at one moment everything seemed to be different. I really don't understand what was happening. There were signs and clues that tells me that there was definitely something wrong. The people around me has also been suspicious. And I asked him why. I asked him the answer to my questions I longed to know. Everbody seemed to know the truth and I didn't. And it felt like I didn't belong. I was screaming inside. Desperately wanting to know the hidden truth. There was a blizzard in the house from outside and I was stuck. I couldn't get out because the door was blocked with some weird sticky thing that has big holes in it. I don't know how to describe it. And as much as I wanted to get out, I just seem to really trust that man behind the door. That same man. I was shouting, wanting to escape that misery. Until, I woke up. No, it's not what you think. It was a dream within a dream. But at that moment, it was reality. My reality. I opened my eyes and see myself in a house. It was a bright day with the warm rays of sunlight throughout the room. I was in bed asleep all this time. It was a beautiful season of summer. There was someone with me. A teenager, a preschooler, and a baby. They were all boys and they were all mine. My children. I got out of bed to go outside. The season then turned to fall. It's not sunshiny as it was after I got out. We live in a cabin somewhere in the middle of a forest. Someone arrived. I was definitely sure who he was. He was wearing a jacket and he was tall. And I trust him. And love him deeply. For he is the one I seek. A ""Man of God"".

"So, I got a new phone today. I'm really thankful for my mom buying me the phone, I just don't know how to show it besides saying thank you.

Also, apparently I'm a goth now. Yesterday I told my sister that I wanted the phone to be black, and this morning she was saying that now I'm a goth lmao. I almost had to get the purple color because my sister wanted black. She got red instead. Thankfully.
The reason I wanted the phone to be black is because my two favorite colors together is blue and black, and I don't think that blue and purple look good together.

Another thing to add is that my sister was really rude to my mom after she bought us the phones. I *hate* the fact that my mom isn't disciplining my sister. She can't just give my mom attitude and act rude after my mom spent so much money to get us new phones. My mom says that she can't control people and that she's tried talking to my sister. I understand that, but my mom can still take her phone away, or something and it would be for a valid reason. My sister gets away with everything.


Although, I think I might know the reason for why my sister was mad. My mom told me that she is jealous/mad that my brother(20) is really successful. I kinda believe that my sister would be mad about that."
"Dear Nat   
How are you?  
How are you today?  
I hope you are doing fine   
I hope you are breathing fresh air   
I hope your heart is light today   
I hope your conscience is clear   
For the most part   
I hope your day is well spent   
I miss you   
""Really?"", with a surprised look on your face  
""Yes, of course"", me trying to sound confident and not awkward   
We were beautiful   
Like the stars in the sky   
We shined bright   
Making the other stars jealous   
We shined bright   
We shined bright   
We flew in the sky   
We traveled time together as we talked   
Not knowing what hour it is   
We went outside the the eyes of the time-lord  
We skipped time as we were listening to each other   
We traveled time   
I was not grounded anymore   
I got lost   
I got lost in time   
I got lost in you   
In your warmth   
In you   
I didn't know  
""Is it good?""   
Is it good? Should I be grounded?   
But I knew I enjoyed it   
I enjoyed it   
Every bit of it   
Well not every bit   
But most of it  
It died before it started   
It died before it started   


My birthday is coming up   
I don't share it anyone   
Only few of my closed ones know   
I wanted to share that with you   
It's next week   
You wanted to know   
I did not want to share it you that day   
I was not sure if I can trust you with it  
Trust?  
Expectations, was let down too many times   
Don't want to feel that again   
I thought I will share it with you   


You told me ""Don't change, be like this forever""   
You told me ""When I am with you, nothing is normal""  
I smiled   
With a warmth in my heart   
Warmth of acceptance   
Warmth of being wanted   
Warmth of a hug   
What happened?  
How did we die?  
You told me I am good looking  
I have been complimented before   
Rarely   
But I did not believe them   
I believed yours   
It touched my heart   
You told me ""I believe in you""  
It touched my heart   
It touched me   
You touched me   
I believed them   
I still do   
What happened?  
You chose him   
You could not let go of a dead relationship for me   
I was not enough for you   


Were you enough for me?  
That's a new question   
I need to think   
I accepted you   
For what you are  
There are things that I don't like about you  
But I tried to accept you as a whole  


I said ""I want someone to partner up""  
""Who can support, not help, support me""  
""And whom can I support, not help but support""   
I want to experience people   
I want to experience you   
Your colors   
Your shadow   
Your light   
And cry   
Cry my heart out when we say goodbye   
I want to hug you tight   
And cry saying goodbye   
I wanted to feel   
I wanted to say goodbye with an ugly smile   
I want to remember you with a smile   
You said you do too  


I could be me with you  
I felt comfortable   
I felt wanted   
I felt accepted   
That was your greatest gift   
I could be silly   
I could be a kid   
The kid in me could come out  
The kid   
The kid who wants to come out so bad  
He came out when you were around  
I made you laugh   
You found me funny   
You found my words interesting   
The way I name things   
The way I call things   
You laughed at my jokes   
You found me funny   
You did not laugh at me, but with me   
When I said or did silly things   
It was marvelous   


I miss waking up next to you  
The few times that we did   
The weekends   
The weekends that I looked forward to   
You put your head on my chest   
I felt wanted   
I felt like a man   
I forgot how it felt   
I felt like a man   
I felt somehow complete   
We made love twice   
I felt so comfortable with you   
You touched me with affection   
You kissed me   
You kissed me on my cheeks   
You played with my beard   
You were so beautiful   
Not by your shape or skin  
But by you, being you   
You hugged me from behind   
You bumped me with your hip   
As I was cooking with serious face   
And then had no option but to show a embarrassed happy smile   


Where are you now?  
Where have you been in the last week and a half   
You told me to keep in touch   
You told me to keep you updated   
But   
It's not a one way thing  
I don't like to feel needy   
How much?  
How much more need I be needy?  
I can't do this   
I know you mean well   
But you  
You need to say you want me too  
Was I needy?  
I know I was  
When I realized  
I pulled back   
I composed myself again   
Was it too much?  
Remember me, it was not your fault   
Don't go looking for one  
We need to protect ourselves you see  
Don't go looking for faults   


I got rejected for the first time  
By you  
Our first kiss  
I got rejected   
I was happy   
At least I tried   
I was happy   
You said, you have trouble saying no  
I gave you a token   
Like I give myself   
A token, to remind you to treat yourself  
To treat yourself for saying no  
You smiled   
You seemed touch   
I thought it was sweet   


I gave you a space in my heart   
And now you are not there  
Now there is a void   
I am sad  
I feel sadness   
I feel loneliness   
It's okay  
I will move on  
I got stronger   
I have a sweet memory of you  
I wanted to say goodbye to you soon   
Just did not know it would be like this  


This is my first poem   
Or was an attempt towards it   
And it is about you   
What does it mean?  
Does it mean you are special?  
You are to me   
After a long time I have let someone in   
Too afraid to get hurt   
I closed myself from the world   
Like a scared dog   
At the sidewalk   
Who barks trembling with fear   
And none goes to   
I mean why should they?   
It's barking   
I pulled myself together   
My greatest achievement so far   
I was expecting for someone to come along  
And fix me   
I have managed to learn that much   
It's just the void   
It was critical for me   
You were critical for me   
I hold no grudges towards you   


You told me to tell the truth   
You have been lied to   
You were afraid   
Not knowing what I am doing   
You asked me   
I smiled   
I was happy   
I asked you for the same   
I held my end of the bargain   
But you didn't   
I made a fool out of myself   
I exposed myself naked   
I made a fool out of myself   


I thought this quarantine would be my heaven   
With you   
I thought you would say   
""Can I come over?""  
""Do you mind if I stay a bit longer?""  
I thought I would say   
""I would love that""  
With a smile   
With a warmth in my heart   
It was not the case   
You are confused   
You are not sure if you should leave your dead relationship   
Which you did not tell me at first   
But you did eventually   
For that I thank you   
You are confused   
I am not enough for you to leave that relationship   
I thought I was special to you   
You told me  
You are the third person I can talk this freely   
After my best friends   
Did you lie?   
I don't think so   
What do I know?  
I have been fooled before   
More than I like to admit   
This time  
I chose to trust someone   
You didn't call me to say that   
I am sad   
I thought I will spend my birthday with you  
I wanted to   
No matter   
I have been alone all my life   
Even when I was relationship   
Pulling the weight of two  
Like the proverbial donkey   
I can be alone again   
I just hope I will not be lonely   
I won't   
I am stronger now  
It will take me some time   
But I can do it   
I knew we won't last   
But I thought we would be true to each other  
Well we were   
It's just that   
You didn't want me   
Like I wanted you   
I couldn't help myself   
So long I have not felt warmth  
After the warmth you shared   
I fell   
Maybe a bit deeper than I would like  
It's okay   
I feel again   
It's sadness  
For so long, it was gray  
It was gray   
Gray everywhere   
Neither joy nor sadness   


I feel like a fool   
I feel naked   
I feel tricked   


But you didn't trick me  
You were truthful   
For the most part   
And I respect that   


I am just tired you know  
Tired of wanting someones company   
While they don't   
I got over it  
I got good   
I became scary good   
Then I decided to open up   
To feel life   
To share human experience   
I did not want to miss this part of life  
Now I feel like a fool   
Why o why I did that?  
I just said that, the why   


Here I am writing  
I did not know I had so much to write   
It feels good  
A sense of righteousness   
A false sense   
A pride, maybe a ego   


I miss you   
I miss your warmth   
I miss being around you   
I miss being myself around you   
I miss sleeping in the same bed   
I miss sleeping cheek to cheek   
Talking about the face   
I miss holding you whole face with my hand   
Your face is tiny   
I like that  
I miss your hair   
I miss messing it up   
I miss you fixing it as soon as I am done  
I miss when you got insecure   
I could feel it  
Without words  
You asked me, ""Can you read my mind?""  
""Seriously, can you?""  
""How did you know what I was thinking?""  
I thought we had a connection   
I thought wrong   


There are so many details I missed  
Some I want to include  
Some I don't   
This seems unfinished   
What do I know  
I have never written before   
Will anyone read this?  
Does it matter?"
"So it is now 5.30am, 11th of April 2020 and it is the last day of my 20s. In less than 24 hours I will turn 30 and… well it feels like I’m absolutely not ready for that. I don’t feel 30. I’m not done with 20s. I feel around 27, and I'm not ready to let my 20s go. I suppose that might be a problem? Well, here we are. Everything i do now, is the last. The last dinner I cooked in my 20s. The last bath I took in my 20s. The last crosstrainer in my 20s. The last sleep of my 20s. The last day of my 20s.

The end of my 20s is taking place during a worldwide lockdown, quarantine and coronavirus pandemic. That’s pretty unique circumstances I suppose. Once in a lifetime? One would hope so. What does that mean for me: my parents couldn’t make it to England to spend my birthday with me, my friends are not allowed to visit, we cannot go out to celebrate. I can’t even go out to buy the stuff I might want to cook or have as a treat on my birthday. On the plus side - i’m an introvert with very little need to go outside, I have my husband by my side, my cat, and a nice house with a garden all to myself (with my two favourite boys). And a chance to tell this as a story, that i will probably appreciate much later in life.

It made me think, how does this compare to the end of my other decades? My 10th I don’t remember at all, at that age it clearly had no significance. But roughly I can say that I was in Israel with my parents, I was a happy carefree kid and my birthday likely involved a few of my friends visiting, tasty food, games, cartoons. And probably a separate dinner party for relatives later. Lots of presents, hot weather, being allowed to miss school that day. Or possibly it was Passover break anyway, I don’t remember.

My 20th. Well, I can’t say I remember that one very well either. But I do know what was happening then - it was Easter break at uni, my second year. My boyfriend was in Odessa with me, my parents were renting a house by the sea and we had a nice bbq with family, friends and anyone my parents and I saw fit to invite. As I said, I don’t actually remember the party, but I have pictures from it - there were lots of people, the weather was nice and everyone seemed happy. Clearly turning 20 was also not a big deal. And then Icelandic volcano erupted and we all got an extra week of holidays in Odessa due to flights getting cancelled because of ash in the air.

So I guess this is not the first time something unusual is happening over my birthday period. But my god, it escalated dramatically since 2010. From a volcano eruption and ash in the air that supposedly interfered with flights over Europe to Brexit, Trump, approaching recession that is being compared to the Great Depression and to top it all - worldwide pandemic with strict lockdown in every country I know and/or care about. What will happen when I turn 40, I don't even want to think about… Guess I have to be happy it’s not worse than that?

On the positive side with these comparisons - well now on my border with 30s I have a husband, a cat, a house, an ongoing doctorate degree, a (somewhat paused) therapy placement and generally a fairly comfortable life. One has to be grateful for that… But mostly, I am and will ever be grateful for the people in my life, my family, husband, parents, friends, course-mates and work colleagues, my supervisors and my students, my clients and my therapist. People are what makes it all worth it and what makes it all bearable and possible and why I would like the lockdown to end at some point (please).

Is that enough to make me ok with crossing that invisible border between 20s and 30s? Well clearly not. That’s not enough. I lost a few years in my mid 20s and now I’m desperately missing those, feeling 27 instead of 29(30) and fighting with every cell of my being the idea of turning 30. I don’t want to. 30 - means mature, calm, cool and collected, being somewhere in life that is fairly centered, grounded, measured. Admitting that you’re an adult. In your 20s you don’t have to be an adult. In your 30s I feel like you kind of do. And that’s not me. I’m not an adult. I’m an eternal child, teenager, someone who wants to play, not work. They say age is arbitrary and means nothing - but you can’t escape it. I can’t just be 27 if that’s how i feel. I can’t say i’m 27, because my passport says otherwise and in our world that is what matters. I wonder if in 2-3 years I will mentally get there, feel like I’m ready for my 30th. Maybe I’m literally just lagging behind because of these 2-3 lost dark years when my life quite literally stopped. I suppose we will see. Assuming we survive the pandemic, recession, Brexit etc. and I get a chance to see… as of now - i’m not ready. I’m not 30. I refuse. I refuse my 30 on the last day of my 20s. Where that leaves me, I don't know, which seems appropriate and fitting with the general climate of limbo and the unknown of the pandemic quarantine. I will have to live on and see. And that is all I know for now."
"Hello there.

I love to write.  And by that I mean I love the idea of writing, being able to put down on paper thoughts in my head.  So no, I don't love writing, but I love what it gives us.  

I guess I want to use this space to reflect on how I became the way I am.  I want to put down my struggles as being atypical.  I don't consider myself trans, although I want to be the other gender.  I don't consider myself gay because the thought of being with a guy, as a guy or a guy crossdressing doesn't really do much for me.  

I'm scared of coming out to my kids.  No, Bobby, Daddy doesn't want to be Mommy.  Well, he does, but it's more complicated than that.  My kids are mostly grown, so I'm less afraid of the lack of understanding than I am of being rejected by them.  

I'm definitely scared of coming out to my family.  My mother, if she was a live, would be the one I'm most scared of.  Ironic, because she was the most accepting person I knew and she's the reason why I accept people for what they are.  But I'm her only son...  I think maybe she knew.  but such was her consideration for me to be me that she didn't ever bring it up.

My dad... that's the funniest one.  Funny because I have written proof from him that he has no problem with people like me.  If my mom suspected, I'm sure she told him, so it's possible he already knows. 

My sister would just be awkward.  For me.  I don't know how to be a sister despite wanting to be nothing more than that to my sister.

My wife knows.  She's known for a long time.  It hasn't been an issue with her because while I've felt this way for several decades, and years before her, I haven't expressed this much or wanted to act out on it.  But recently it has, by mutual decision, become more relevant in our day to day lives.  I'm sure I will touch on this more in the future. 

I'm gonna warn you now...  my thoughts are random and manic and all over the place.  It's very much going to be a Jeremy Bearimy train of thought.  Not at all logical, looping and weaving around.  And the Dot will be Tuesday.  Or July.  Or sometimes never.  

I really wanted to reflect on how I became this way, but Jeremy Bearimy baby.  Next entry, maybe.

<3 katie"
"Diary,

I hope you’re being amused by my cabin fever ramblings as I go on about my life stuck at home. This is the only thing that I’ve really looked forward to doing all day.

(Funny enough, I started this account in November and when I started to check my app a little more, I had 20 karma, now I’m at 400 or something. Fun!) 

Everyone’s hating being stuck at home. My dad still goes to work because he’s in the medical field. My brother’s out of school and playing Mario Kart all day. Well, I’m not really stuck at home. In two days I’ll be heading into work uncertain about what’s actually going to happen during a seven-hour shift. Apparently the state thinks I’m a significant employee to have around amidst this time of panic. But really, I wonder who whispered into who’s ear about all of this. 

Right now, I’m starting to feel like everyone’s true colors are coming out during all of this. Companies are especially showing what matters to them during this time of overwhelming panic that’s sweeping the planet right now. I think someone over at the corporate office is rolling around in a pool of money, laughing at everything with excitement because there are actual profits coming in. They’ll do anything to make money off of people’s panic. 

I’m having a hard time walking into work and acting like everything is fine. I am reminded of everything that’s going on when someone calls and asks me if I’m going to be stocked on hand sanitizer or toilet paper anytime soon. 

I’m moving on from the subject. The more I talk about the company I work for and how badly we’re going to get hit by this COVID19 panic, I get a little anxious about everything and it just needs to stop. 

Every day, I’m doing a little bit better than I was yesterday. My mind drowns in schoolwork, chores and other things that I’m doing around the house and I forget to open up twitter to check the news or look on Facebook to see what idiots I went to high school are saying about this. I’m in my own bubble with the people I choose to roll around to and talk with. 

I have to tell myself: No peeking. 

If I peek, I’ll get anxious and I’ll begin to binge-read articles about what’s going on and get even more swept up in the White House press briefings. I’m trying to go around with a smile on my face saying it’s business as usual. So far, It’s going well. 

Hope you’re well, Diary,

(Maybe) Bukowski"
"Two years have gone by. Where were your interests, values and friendship? Today, you texted me. Was it out of boredom? I put trust in you. I remember feeling that I needed to take care of you. Therefore, I replied back. Was it a mistake? I don't know. I trust no one, yet easily trust some people. At the expense of my mental health, I wanted to protect you and still feel like I need to. Where will this outcome lead to?"
"Quarantine Files

Day 1(Actually 2 but only thought of it now)

Boredom just absolute bordem and uncertainty for what lies ahead, most establishments such as restaurants and movie theatres have shutdowns, towns high streets more and more empty, biggest personal blow was the closing down of gyms and fitness centers without those I'll struggle to entertain myself for the next few days but life finds a way, home calisthenic exercises will serve in place of gym for now."
"[real] 3/6/20 View of myself vs people’s view of me

So for the past few years I’ve told people things in confidence, that would later be used against me in the public arena. I no longer trust most people and consider most attempts to dig into my life another way to use info against me.

I’ve been working on trusting people again. My girlfriend told me of the numerous things she had already knew about me that I was embarrassed of, but she personally didn’t care about. She tells me that everyone has skeletons in the closet and that people you consider close friends using that info to purposefully embarrass you should not be considered close friends. I’m the only strawberry in my friend “group” in that I’m the only one who’s issues are fully known by everyone because I foolishly told people I thought we’re friends In confidence years ago. 

Recognizing that it is not normal behavior for people to vindictively do that is one thing I have learned through this experience. My girlfriend no longer talks to the people she knows personally tried to ruin me and suggested I do the same.

Ever since I’ve grown apathetic to the people that used my insecurities as a punch line as though I didn’t have emotions, they are now apologetic. “I was just having fun”, “I didn’t know that we were hurting you”, “I don’t want you to think that I’m a bad person”, “are you still mad at us?”, “Here’s a gift I’m sorry”, “I’ve changed from the person I was at that time. I was just jealous and insecure, I’ve changed now”, “you know I’ve always had a crush on you”, “I don’t know if you want to hang with us anymore”. 


I find myself indifferent to these statements. Time and time again they’ve tried to poison the well with girls I’m talking to, or tried to act like my accomplishments don’t matter. 

Trying to ruin my reputation just to get a girl I’m with is corny. Being jealous of “a guy like me” getting “a girl like that” is corny. Saying I try too hard or am a loser for going to the gym and studying is corny. At this point I’m just trying to move on with my life. My head had probably been damaged beyond repair. But I have to live for me and forget these people. Starting today I choose myself."
"I skipped one yesterday, but I'm here today.

I'm clean from drugs and alcohol a year, six months, and sixteen days. !!!!!!

Feel meh, feel bleh, but feel good too. Thank god I have such good people in my life, but I have this friend, her name is. I appreciate her more than most. She's a different one, and she's doing better now. I'd definitely fuck her if she were up for it, but I don't think we'd work out as a couple. I love her though, as a friend, very much.

""Don't walk away right before the miracle happens. Don't walk away before it happens because it might happen tomorrow. Or today. Or a year from now. But don't walk away."" Is what someone said today. A few miracles have happened to me. Now I'm waiting for the next one. See they're ""miracles"" but they're also essentials to living. I can't be alive if I'm using. Well, not for long.

Tomorrow is another day. Corona scares, sure, but not for me. I think a strong 23 year old like me can survive a super flu. My mother might not though, and that concerns me. I try not to think about it.

I'm dying to stick my dick in something, but more so than that I wanna cuddle. I love cuddling, and loving, and talking to each other like nobody else and nothing else might matter. Extremities are rarely a good or realistic thing though."
"I walk among my insecurities, questing desirability. 

I look beneath my abnormalities, wishing I could change. 

I relapsed into fear and forbidden ground, only to feel disgust and incomplete. 

I wish for so many things. For comfort, for normality, for confidence. However, people often believe my qualities are a factor of ugliness. How could I reach towards my identity if people often comment against my appearance and value? Even if I try, I'll be called onto the destruction of words. Even if I found purpose, it fades away with judgement. Even if I believe in myself, several others always disregard it. 

How could people support others in terms of societal rebellions for beauty and intelligence, yet pursue to mock and look down on me? Often the answer, it is my fault. 

I feel disgust in myself. I want to run away from my reflection. In terms of the worlds' rules, I have lost. For beauty, I have none. For intelligence, I have little. For being someone, I am no one."
"It's 8:09 PM. I'm tired, after a day of work. I had so much fun at work. Good money too, on Fridays.

Still I woke up at 4:30 am and I'm tired. I gotta haul my ass into the car and drive to NA soon anyway though, cause I haven't been to a meeting yesterday and I won't be at one tomorrow. And you know, consistency is key. That's something my friend told me just now. He's Chinese and he's not from NA. Poor guy, he's been stuck inside his home ever since this Coronavirus mess started. His Boyfriend flew to Chile for some work and he's there alone going nutssssssssssssss

&#x200B;

Anyhow.

&#x200B;

Tomorrow I'm visiting my father. I don't like that, but I also do like that. I mean I'd like to murder the guy because it'd be easier on me, instead of doing the work. ""You made me what I am dad!"" is what I wanna say, and it'd be even easier to stab him in the kissah. Nah nah. I'll just hug the guy and enjoy our time together. I'm not a kid anymore and what's past is past, as Taylor Swift says. Taylor is one of my idols.

&#x200B;

I wanna feel sorry for myself, but there's no reason to.

&#x200B;

Today I'm clean one year, six months, and 11 days. The key to staying clean is to keep coming back. The key to staying alive is staying clean, and staying clean is, in itself, the hardest thing there is. It gets easier, but only if you do it every day. That's the hard part."
"I've got to separate my work from my personal life. I'm starting to get obsessed more and more with the research I'm part of. It's becoming possessive, though not as crazy as the other investigators. Then again, that's what I'm worried about. Give it enough time and I'll become exactly like them.

This week was terrible for me. My right ear has been bothering me, and I know why but I need a specialist to check me out. The clinicians suggested I visit an otolaryngologist, which is a doctor who specializes in ear, nose and throat (E.N.T., for short). I haven't had the time because of this damned work. And, to make matters worse, our cold room on our floor broke down. Yup. We thankfully didn't lose any reagents like the freezer disaster, but God, what an *enormous* pain in the ass! As if my work couldn't get any harder! I have no idea how the piece of shit broke, but my guess it may have been an electrical problem, or its compressor died. We've had to relocate everything in different cold rooms throughout the facility. Kill me.

Ugh, and on top of all of this, we've a guest in our lab who wants to shadow over our work. I don't mind anyone taking admiration in our work, but this is going to slow my duties down even further, and it's awkward having a stranger hovering over my procedures. I don't hate the guy at all. He's been nothing but polite, patient and observant in our work. It was just so sudden that he came in without any forewarning from the Professor. Whatever, it'll be a good experience, I guess.

 The hospital's officials have been alerting us more and more to this Corona virus, and they've given it an official name: COVID-19. I'm not a virologist, so my knowledge regarding virus biology is limited to college-level stuff. We haven't had patients exhibiting any symptoms of the virus, nor have there been any confirmed cases. It's not like I would know, anyway, considering I don't do much clinical stuff. I think people are panicking over this way too much, though it is the officials' job to be vigilant about this. I'm not scoffing at any patients who're currently sick with the disease or those the virus has brought to the morgue, but we've lost more people to other illnesses than this one. And, of course, our medicine has gotten better and better over the years for us to be able to handle this thing.

I've been having nightmares again. Like I said, this entire week was terrible for me. I didn't feel like moving at all. It's probably a short episode of depression, but nothing that would constitute as clinically significant. I don't know, I guess the stress is slightly getting to me. My ear and head are hurting, but it's nothing I can't handle.

Despite all the gloom from this entry, I did technically get promoted. Rather, I've been officially assigned as a research associate with the two postdoc fellows in our lab. I'll help them out on whatever stuff they've got lined up, and from what I understand, it looks like they're mainly focused on protein research. It'll be nothing but Western blotting from here on out, it seems, among my other duties.

There was something else. I've been thinking on what I'll be doing after this. This is not a permanent job for me, obviously, and while I enjoy my team and the splendors of academia (this is not sarcasm), I can't stay in one place. I was thinking of going back into industry, but I'm not so sure anymore. Maybe government sector? I was always interested in doing forensics with the police, though I don't specialize in that. I could try going to the federal level with agencies like the F.B.I., but those guys are super competitive, and hearing back from them could take months or even *years*. 

I'll figure it out in time. One thing at a time."
"20-feb-2020

I write this not as the obituary of those horrors that assaults the man fron all directions, but as the register and probe of all those victories that have to be forgotten by the breath of the history.

By this way, I give beginign and introduction to a new pneuma in this diary, that has to represent in its homogenizer totality as the narration of a new period in the odiseum of the common man; and its funtion is register those fears that inmaculated us, those malaises that rushed us and those 7empest that fulminated us in the search of the maximun human ideal: be invencible.

By this way, while I write this in my notebooks, my Reddit´s or Wattpad´s profiles or in my tipewriter I will aspire more and more to leave my condition ass common and ascend to the invencible."
"Dear Diary,

Even though life has been fine lately, even though years are passing, even though time is moving foward, I still think about him every day. 

A moment of nostalgia led me to discover an unsent song. Seeing the date it was posted brought back all the old feelings. I wish I had seen it long ago.

We are not in each other's lives anymore, but I truly cared for him, and I shared more with him than I share with my own family. That can't be erased, nor should it be. Those events, the happy times and the pain are part of me. They will stay with me always. 

I hope he's being himself and getting through each day, following his path, knowing that he's the best."
"Ughhhh. This one might be a bit ranty. I know in a teenager and none of this will matter in a few years and that it doesn't matter but reddit is now my outlet for talking to people. Which is nice because I dont care about embarrassing myself or trying to look good in other people's eyes and it makes me feel like someone cares. Also to the people who commented the other day that was really nice thank you :)

So, today was the most normal run of the mill day ever. Nothing interesting happened I just got more sad. I was talking to some female friends about valentines day. And my friends dont yet know that it hasn't worked out with this girl yet so I had to lie and say I was planning to get her a teddy bear and go to the cinema and so on. So we were talking about it and they start laughing and giving wierd looks and i ask what's wrong. Long story short they dont think she would ever like me. 'I dont want to lie to his face, be honest he is unlikable'. They said she only kissed me because she was drunk and at this point they are probably right. I mean I'm a fat socially awkward nerd. They basically crushed any self confidence I had and that was only made worse when at lunch a girl was giving out 'honest ratings' and I got like a 4 for looks and a 4.5 for personality or something like that. There completely right to and that's what makes it worse. I've tried so many times but everyone already had this image of me and j cant change from it. Like I've been given this identity and I want to change it but they wont let me. I'm trying I really am. But it never works. I want to be better and fitter and funnier but it always end in failure. 

Moving on from that I wasted another 6 hours on that game and then played lego star wars with the girl. It was the first time since she rejected me and it was honestly so much fun. I've always been terrible with hints and I cant tell if I'm missing obvious ones or making ones up in my mind. I guess I'm not missing them but just doing nothing about them. I'm to scared to and according to everyone else I shouldn't be getting them and shes probably just being nice. Idk anymore. Idk anything anymore. 

Goodnight reddit"
"Hellooo, boring. That it really for today. There was a big storm going over the uk today and it trapped me inside. I played games and texted people that's basically it. My dad baught me a new game today Europa unerversalis 4. It seems like lots of fun but very complicated, it's going to take a while to learn. Also in trying to play it on an old laptop so it's quite slow unfortunatly. He gave it me in exchange for being his model for a day. He is a photographer and needed someone to hold the products he was advertising. Wasnt that bad but it took like 4 hours of just standing there. 

Currently just texting friends and hoping school is shut for tomorow.

I dont think there is anything for me to rant about today tbh. Comming to terms with mega crush on this girl but that's it really.

Goodnight lovely people of reddit. :)"
"Hello, so today was once again school. I didn't manage to act well enough to convince my mum I shouldn't go in so I went to school. It was just like any school day tbh wasnt bad but wasnt good at the same time. Just kind off meh. I came home and wasted a few more hours of my life on the internet and then I went to mcdonalds for some horrible processed food and then to archery. I'm alright at archery, it's fun but takes up lots of time. I currently have 4 county records but I doubt they will be there for long. Archery was very busy today tho as it was a competition shoot instead of just training. After that I came home and played on the xbox with a mate from archery, let's call him speno. 

So that was my day, just as boring as normal. 

So I'm trying to move on from this girl, it really hurts but its probably best if I just try and forget about her. I think I just met the right person at the wrong time and that sucks, I mean we had really good chemistry but I messed it up. I hadn't ever got that far with a women so I didnt no what to do and quickly messed it up. Life is a bout mistakes tho so I'm sure I'll do better next time. 

Throwing away a friendship like that is hard like I really care for her but ugh. 

I met her through 2 people at archery speno and his gf. They invited me to some parties and the girls is the gf's best friend so she was there to. They didnt mention her once throughout archery or when we were talking over xbox which I'm kinda surprised and suspicious about because all speno would do up until she told me she couldn't go out with me was constantly ask how it was going. So they clearly no which I'm not surprised about but maybe they just agreed not to bring it up which is fine. I did kind of want to to talk to speno about it tho, we are good friends and just wanted to get those feelings out to someone but the convo didnt go in that direction. 

I have some pictures and videos of me and the girl, I'm not sure wether to delete then or not. I mean it might help me move on but they are cute and it was one of the best nights of my life and I kinda dont want to forget it at the same time ya know. 

Right I'll stop moping I just need to man up. I messed it up so be it :/
Kinda sucks that its valentines in a week I had it all planned out but alas I'm condemned to loneliness. 

Etleast it's the weekend now

Sorry for boring you, goodnight

"Well, I feel exhausted, so this entry is going to be short. Basically, one of the freezers in our labs decided to die. Apparently, its compressor stopped working and wasn't freezing like it's supposed to. And, to make matters worse, we weren't alerted about it until 3 days later.

We had over 400 samples in that freezer. That is from approximately 10 years of research that just died in there. The postdoc who had her stuff in there went hysterical. I feel so bad for her. I don't think most people realize it, but many of these scientist dedicate their lives and the livelihood of their career into research. They genuinely do care about helping people through biomedical research. 

I have no idea what we're going to do. She called in sick today, complaining about a massive headache. I don't blame her. She's probably having a migraine from all the stress and the reality of it all befalling onto her.

At a grand total, that stuff cost us about half a million dollars. What a damn waste. 

We're gonna have to find a way to fix this, and fast."
"Hello, I think I'm gonna try and post here every day. Theres lots about myself that I dont like and hopefully this would be a place for me to log my experiences of trying to improve myself and talk about all the crappy bits of being 15. The few main things I'd like to change first is my YouTube addiction, my endless procrastination, me being overweight and lack of revision for 2nd of school tests. 

I'm starting now because just the other day I hit a low again. But last time writing in a diary helped me improve 2s it gave me a reason to so I didnt let down the diary. Idk but hopefully having people know that I failed will make this strategy work even better. 

So what did I actually do today, 
Well I pretended to be sick in the morning so I dodnt have to go to school I really just needed some time to think about things. Consequently I stayed in bed for a good few hours played on my xbox for a bit and then made a para cord bracelet for my dad which he loves :). He baught me the kit to make one for christmas it just took me a while to get round to it. I watched alot of youtube probably like 5-7 hours today. I know thats really bad. I cleaned my room. I know some people hate cleaning their room but I find it therapeutic and looking at how nice my room is after is awsome. I pretended to be fighting monsters with my dog for a bit and played on the xbox some more. Thinking I pretty much wasted the day when I could have been doing the huge mountain of work I have for school. The day went pretty quick and that's pretty much all I did. Oo actually before bed I did actually take care of my skin. I dont have good/perfect skin but at the same time I dont have acne just a few spots. I used this wierd paste thing it sting but apparently helps idk. 

Just about to head to hed maybe listen to an audio book, hopefully get an early night

Goodnight reddit and whoever's might be reading this sorry for boring you :)"

"Dear Teddy,


It's been a few days. My toe looks disgusting by the way but I'm walking better. I took the shots better than I expected but they definitely hurt. I punched the wall and bit my arm but I didn't cry. Thankfully, that doctor had the best sense of humor and the scary parts were done. I saw the blood and nail that had been causing months of pain and I'm glad I finally decided to go. 


Today was a good day. I went to a party with non-alcoholic jello shots and waters in the ice chest that normally have tons of beer. Alcoholism runs deep in my family so I was very proud of these efforts of recovery. It's been months for him and he's doing better than ever. 
-tears up-


Teddy, I did zero work during this break. I don't regret it either. I know I'll be suffering the cost of my inactions all this week. Sometimes I miss having a job that didn't require me to bring it home. I've got a better balance than ever before so I know playing catch up will be hard but not unbearable.


-looks at clock-
Who will beat the clock tonight?
My thoughts or my eyes?

Goodnight Teddy.

"I'm caught in the wheel of life. Time cycles on and I can't shake the funk. Almost 24 years and I'm still thinking I'm going to be able to change my life this year. 

I am actually starting this year more positive than I have in the past. Last year started with my Ex attempting suicide in my home. It was a terrible relationship and that was the big manipulation preceded by many smaller ones. 

My cousin tried too. He's my best friend and I love him. I often think about what I could have done to help him not end up there. He's doing a lot better now.

It's strange that somehow the bad can make you into better. Aside from meeting the man of my dreams, 2019 was a disservice to me. Yet somehow I've come out in the black. 

I find myself hoping for an incredibly mediocre 2020.

Goodnight™™™"
"The fear of time... Am I the only one who thinks like this? Every New Years the same thoughts pop into my mind. Like popcorn rotating in the microwave on another lonely Saturday night... Time goes by so fast. Your childhood memories of the Cinderella slippers tapping on the wood floor, have already been wiped away by the rain that falls down the windshield as you leave the driveway where you spent the last 18 years of your life. I’m losing track of those days. Of all the days. Christmas came and went. Holidays aren’t the same. And now here we are. Welcome to 2020! A new decade and yet the same old shit. Rent is due tomrrow and your phone bill is two days late. You know you need to work more hours yet here you are. Still thinking about the rear-view mirror on that rainy day and your grandmother crying in the reflection. Your graduation cap has been thrown, yet you’re still stuck where you were 6 months ago."
"Merry Christmas Eve everyone. And for those of you (like myself) who think religion sorta sucks, I hope your day is going well. 

Song of the Day: Sweet Disaster

So my cousins are in town for Christmas. Which is really nice, I haven’t seen them in a while and they might be my favorite extended family. 

I leave tomorrow for Vaca at like 8PM so that’s gonna be brutal, but at least it will be fun. And I get to legally drink where I’m going so #partah

I’m so sad rn tho. Like seriously. Something about holidays and family. I feel utterly destroyed and downtrodden. I don’t know how to feel happy. 

My girlfriend is sad too, her parents are shitty and she’s always talking about how sad it is we’re gonna break up. And she doesn’t believe it’s worth it. Also whenever I’m sad she wants to make me happy. And she doesn’t get that sometimes she can’t do that. That sometimes, no matter what, I’m gonna feel depressed, and she doesn’t get it. And says “I bet someone will make you happy” so I feel guilty that I can’t be happy for her. She makes me happier than anyone else ever has. But still. I’m sad

Signing off. Maybe I’ll post on holiday. By y’all"

"Dear Diary

Yes, I know it's confusing.  I just said I don't buy into organized religion.  Okay, I didn't say that, but I am now.  I don't buy into organized religion.  The idea of someone being in charge of this reality, creating what we're experiencing here, and actually caring about every single one of us, 7.7 billlion people and county, is ridiculous to the extreme.  If the number of souls is much much lower than 7.7b, then maybe I could see that.   There's an old Robert Heinlein novel where he implies that most people on the planet are golems, which I interpreted to mean that they're just animated robots.  With some of the people I see around, yeah, I can buy that. But I digress.

There's a story you should check out Diary.  It's called *The Egg*, by Andy Weir.  Yeah, the guy who wrote *The Martian*.  It's a short story, and I like it.  I feel like we're here to learn, and to me just one life is not enough.  This story, without going into too much detail and digressing even more than I already have, answers that nicely.  

I like the idea though of someone, some extra real person, being there to help and guide.  It's like the opening to *City of Angels*, supernatural beings helping and calming people through their day.    But as much as I like that idea, I just don't see it as being viable. I may not like the concept of organized religion, but I do seem to read a lot of books about it and watch tv shows and movies on the topic.

But today's SotD I listen to and... believe in?  Accept?  Hope for?  I dunno... anyways, it agrees with my mantra of *If I can just get through today*.  I try to use this to keep positive.  Of course, I usually add ""Yeah, this will be over soon, but then what other crap am I going to have to deal with?""

Baby steps, Diary.  Baby steps."
"Dear Diary

I wish I wasn't so timid.  I hate posting to reddit... I don't want to argue. I'd like to just put my opinion out there and if you agree, great.  If you don't like it, well don't read it.  I'm not going to argue with you about my beliefs.  It's like fjords.  Important to me, but I'm not going to fight to the death for fjords. 

As the SotD goes, I don't need to fight/To prove I'm right.  It's my opinion.  Don't like it?  Well, the earth will continue rotate.  The sun will still come up. 

That being said, I came very close to responding to an AskReddit post about depression, and how you get through it.  Fake it til you make it would have been my response.  Except I did that thing where you don't read the whole text and assume you know how it's going to end.  The post was actually about how you fake it *convincingly*.  That I have no idea.  So glad I didn't respond, because the question was already acknowledging that you fake it until you make it.

But that question stayed with me.  I was - am - so good at faking it I even convinced myself that I was okay.  Still for all that I can't tell you how I act like nothings wrong.  

I am so good at convincing myself that I'm not depressed that I feel like a charlatan when going to therapy.  Surely, I've said to myself durring my sessionss, S/NS can tell I'm faking it.  

Sad part is, I don't know what's real anymore.  Since I can lie to myself so well, what else am I lying to myself about?"
"Dear diary

So it's been a while yeah? Almost 8 months. Lot has happened, but not much I care to write out here. Sorry. So it goes.

Therapy has been like sex for me lately. Less than satisfying. S had to go home a few months back, and their replacement started out okay. But there's something about NS (New S) that keeps me from really committing to the process. I should ask for a new therapist but losing S and having to rebuild the trust and rapport was hard and I don't want to go through that again. 

The truth of the matter is Diary, that I have found my purpose in life. And I hate it. I'm too selfish to be this giving person that Fate wants me to be. Maybe on this turn of the wheel that's what I need to learn. Oh how I wish the lesson was not this one.

I also had an epiphany today. Depression is not bad as long as you control it. I tried the pills. I tried the meditation and mindfulness.  Of them all, mindfulness seemed to be the best control system for me.  But it's not something I need to purge from me like a virus or a quesadilla that's gone bad in my tummy. No it's a part of me. It defines me and part of me -maybe a large part - is here because of it.  I suck. I'm a terrible person... But I've seen the me without the depression and that person is not who i want to be.

Ah well. Not gonna make this a beat up on me session. Just gonna acknowledge some of the harsher truths about yours truly and be grateful that I'm starting to see the light in the darkness that is me.

"You're holing yourself up and closing off again. 

You're being evasive and vague. You're putting on the mask for people who want you. You're hiding. 

You don't want to admit how fiercely and intensely you've begun to feel, and how it scares you. It shows. You're conjuring any lie to run away, to ease the fear that you're opening yourself up to more hurt. 

The warmth he gives you... You're so cold, it's an insidious blaze beneath the surface that threatens to consume your paper skin and dried-out mind. 

You would rather shrivel away in darkness than see if you are even capable of growing.

You're a coward. You always have been."
"I heard on a podcast once that we humans rarely feel only 1 emotion. Most times we're feeling a jumbled up mess of emotions which makes it difficult to slowly peel apart to see what's really there.

I've been trying to peel apart my jumbled mess for weeks but haven't made much progress. It does feel as if there's this tightly wound up ball of twine right where my heart should be. I can't seem to find where the twine starts and when I tug on one part it just tightens another.

On the surface, I'm both exhausted and not exhausted. Given my current arrangements, I should be far more tired than I am and I can only think that maybe through some exotic miracle my sleep has actually been restoring me enough to function on a moderately high level.

I'm feeling worried, but that feeling was in the house when I moved in. It's something I inherited and am continuously dealing with, especially worry about the future.

I'm nervous about work. Save for a couple small things, I've got a good handle on my projects right now. I shouldn't be feeling nervous about work, in fact I've come so far in the past few years that I am quite proud when I stop to think about it. But the nervousness creeps back in.

I'm frustrated at life in general. I need to learn how to let go and let stuff just slide off me without it affecting me. How do other people do that?

I'm angry at people. I'm angry at questions not answered. I'm angry at those dickheads who ignored my request for reimbursement. Shit heads, I hope you fall into a pile of manure.

Deep down, I think I'm speechless. Not in that awe-inspired way but more of ""is this seriously all there is?"" Underwhelmed, I guess, I expected far more. And at it's center, Disappointment. Ah, hello darkness my old friend, I'd almost forgotten about you!"
"I cry alone. I cry after useless pain. I cry for past self. I cry for the purpose of salvation, for a word of validation. Yet, my reflection reminds me of various insecurities. Pictures flick ugliness upon my face. Words and stares produce the hatred of my features. 

Even after weight loss, I thought I secured comfortability. Yet, my face remains with disgusting genes. Chub-like, man-like, huge-like. There’s no words for encouragement, no treatment for my appearance. Even though I pushed myself into the realms of acceptance, reality is often nearby, stating that I will always be less in either appearance or talent. 

For my brother, he was born gifted and beauty-like. He was special, unlike me. Even upon my first words, I trembled hatred. Why was I exposed towards the reality of poverty? Of conspiracies? Of lies and manipulation? When he was sheltered among happiness and innocence of childhood? 

I wish to be happy. But I fear it’s too late. I never had the opportunity for expression or desire. Now I’m older, failure is limited. 


Never once have I been noticed. Never once was I important. First impressions are usually last. Why can’t I be beautiful? Confident? Even family members laugh at my own sight. Even they have stated the obvious. Even though I believe I’m changing, it’s never enough. 

I saw a picture of myself today. These words are a result. I’m afraid of my reflections. Fearful of pictures. It’s my fault for crying. I’m sorry for dedicating time for useless worries. I just wish and continue wishing, but remain alone and scared."
"For context, I'm almost done with my 10 month service project with AmeriCrops NCCC (A service program for 18-24 year olds, we spend 10 months traveling the country as teams of around 10 and working with a variety of nonprofits in a variety of service areas. Its effectively 10 months of travel, on a government budget, with a scholarship attached if you complete the program). Anyway, here goes:

&#x200B;

There’s a river about a half mile down the road from this summer camp, and I walked down there in the dark not long ago because I couldn’t sleep. I walked down in the dark and then laid down on a bench by the river bank and stared at the stars. It just felt so right. I just love that feeling. I imagined I was on another rafting trip, I imagined the tents scattered about, everyone’s sleeping areas hidden away in whatever private spots they could find. I imagined the boats tied in the water, I imagined the kitchen area not too far away. I remembered Senior Seminar. I imagined the bus not too far away, the tarps we called shelter crinkling underneath us as we lay there. I heard coyotes and thought of all the times I encountered them hiking back home. I thought of homesickness. Yesterday marked the end of the third to last work week with AmeriCorps NCCC. We have 2 more work weeks. 10 more work days. Then closure and then, I fly to Georgia, spend thanksgiving with extended family, and drive home to Denver with my mother who I will meet there.

Most of all, I thought about my service year. I have done a disservice in writing so seldom in this journal about it. I barely mentioned Detroit, Minnesota, Kentucky. All the people I’ve met and country I’ve seen. I suppose I’ve been too busy to write very often, either way its a shame.

I recalled, lying on the shores of this river, a quote I once saw on a picture of a raft framed in a riversports equipment store near Denver. I don’t remember the author, but it was something to the effect of “the river will harden the callouses on my hands, and soften the callouses around my heart”. It sounds about right. There’s something about whitewater rafting, the long days on the river, the campfires on the shore, the people, the wilderness, the lack of normal niceties like toilets or internet, that cultivates introspection, and reflection in general. The same is true for my service here. The long days in Illinois, throwing chainsaws around and withstanding the heat from our controlled burns (heat great enough that it melted my boots). The long hours building trails and cutting down brush in Detroit, and Camp Timbers. The long days with all the hand tools we used at Camp Timbers, Camp Esquagama, and everywhere really. The challenging circumstances of our housing, both withstanding the abandoned house that we were made to call home in Kentucky, but also the unfortunate situation with bed bugs in our Detroit Hostel that had us sleep on the office floor of our sponsor, and then a hotel room, before unfortunately being forced to a return. All the interpersonal drama, the differences in work styles, world views, and communications between me and my teammates. This program has left me with thicker callouses on my hands indeed (to say nothing of the farmers tan).

At the same time, it has softened the shield around my heart. The poverty I saw working with the Red Cross in Detroit. The holes in walls, the dirty mattresses lying directly on the floor, the bulletproof glass in the fast food places. That one time we got an address wrong by 1 digit, and it took us to a wealthy neighborhood that, despite only being 10 minutes away from the house we were supposed to go too, looked like it was in another country entirely. Oh the difference a single number can make. Then theres Camp Courageous. The campers here who can’t speak, can’t walk, often can’t even eat, drink, go to the bathroom, or get dressed without help. The people who’s disabilities are so debilitating, that the only way they can communicate their anger and frustration are violence towards us. The fact that if it weren’t for places like this camp, these people would likely spend their whole lives in group homes, or on the streets, with no freedom to see the world.

For Christ’s sake, I saw my privilege for the first time. Just being able bodied, and coming from a financially stable background means I have worlds of opportunities many of the people I served don’t.

So… Is AmeriCorps NCCC worth it? Hell yes. The best education I ever had, and, just like the river, I suppose it has hardened the skin on my hands, and softened the shield on my heart."
"I’m not sure what to say or think or feel anymore. Everything I try only satisfies me for a moment until I feel like I’m barely living. It’s all motions at this point. 

Then we have you. You’re so obsessed and consumed with him right now, that it’s breaking me apart. The daily texts are gone, and the conversations aren’t sustainable. I’m trying to figure out if I did something wrong or to piss you off and not want to talk, but I can’t think of anything. I miss you like crazy, and I feel as I lose you more, I’m losing myself. You’ve helped me to sustain some sort of desire to keep going for the last few years, and now it’s deteriorating to the point I’ve thought too hard into too many things I’d have preferred not to. I’m surrounded by people, but nobody is breaking down the glass I’m trapped in to find out what’s really wrong."
"I had to cut away someone from out of my life. No, it's not my dumb-ass cousin, but it's someone else who is most likely going down on the same path as him. He's immature, insufferable, condescending in every bit of his way, and I just found out recently he's bigoted in every sense of the word. Yeah, that's a hard pass for me. I actually gave the guy ample opportunities to fix his act, but I seriously doubt it'll ever come to that. So, I'm cutting him off for good. I like to think of it as trimming the fat--or killing the cancer.

Bah, forget about that guy. Everyone else I know who knows him don't like him, either. He's a jackass, end of story.

Work today wasn't as intense as yesterday, but I did have to stay a little more than usual to help with a few things. While it does mean I get paid extra, there's no overtime, unfortunately. I get paid by the hour, and because our lab is running on grants, donations and outside collaborators, we've literally not enough money to go around. Grants are nice but obtaining one is very difficult. It's not as easy as asking, ""Please give us money, we're doing medical research to help people"". I don't want to get into the process of grant writing, because that's not my job anyway.

I gotta work tomorrow, and it's a Saturday, so this sucks. Oh well, there's nothing I can do.

Goodnight."
"I don't feel so good. Today, I was feeling pretty well to start off the morning, but I slowly began to feel...off. There's a medical condition known as malaise, which is French for ""bad feeling"". Patients describe it as an oncoming feeling of morbidity and illness just before they fully become sick. Well, I think it's fair to say in my case, that's what happened to me today.

I try to avoid the monotony and gloom of other people's conversations. Stuff such as, ""It's a day closer to Friday!"" or ""Another day, another dollar"", are a real turn off for me. I mean no disrespect to others. Of course, you're allowed to say whatever you want and vent however you like, but I try to steer away from those attitudes. They become so infectious, and before you know it, you start to pick it up yourself.

I'm happy with my current job, but I feel empty today, as if a bunch of heavy weights were dragging me around. The best way I can describe it is if you had a ball and chain around your ankle, but now imagine as the day progresses, your sullen emotions kept feeding the weight of that ball.

Maybe the change of season is making me feel this way. I don't know, and I'm not going to try to play doctor with myself. I need to focus on my job and make better connections, that's all. And, better yet, I need to avoid those who would put me down with their negativity. I'm not with that anymore, and honestly, I never was.

I feel like I want to write more, but I don't think anything coherent will come out further with these words. I could just type and type and type and it'll start to look like a manic person wrote it.

With that being said, I'll end it here before I start rambling on. 

Goodnight."
"Lately, I've been skimming books more so than reading them start to end. I'll go to Barnes & Noble, walk down some random aisle, grab a book that piques my interest, glance at the table of contents, flip to the chapter that sounds most appealing, then read a paragraph, a page, or the whole chapter. I can understand why the avid reader would hate me for this, but I think it's a great way to get into the reading groove and explore new genres. I don't know, what's your opinion on this?

Anyway, this is how I spent my afternoon yesterday. I found a book called ""Becoming Supernatural"" by Dr. Joe Dispenza. I admit although I was attracted to the book cover, the title kind of put me off - it sounded like all those other pseudo-self-help books that I've been trying to avoid lately (the one genre I'm trying to stay away from at the moment) but I gave it a try anyway. Flipped to the chapter about staying in the present.

It was a pleasant surprise. I'll try to give a summary of the chapter in the most logical flow and in my best recollection:

Essentially what Dr. Disepnza argues is that in order to be in the present, one cannot have a familiar past or a predictable future. By having a familiar past (recalling events, memories, etc.) then your thoughts evoke the feelings associated with the past, and those feelings evoke the thoughts associated with the past - you get into a thinking-feeling loop. Then your past becomes your future because everything is predicted and the feeling/thoughts are already assumed. Consequently, the narrative that you write in your head reaffirms those thoughts and feelings when those future events do come, thus fueling the thinking-feeling loop even more. So how does one avoid this loop? By keeping your energy internal, as external events are always in competition for our energy. By conserving our energy, we can utilize it for creative tasks and allow the unpredictable and unanticipated events to occur in our lives, which break us out of the thinking-feeling loop and ultimately allow us to stay in the present.

There's a lot more depth to the chapter, but these are the nuts and bolts. This is something most of us probably know already, but it's a good reminder to have; allow unanticipated events to break us out of the monotonous Groundhog Day limbo.

"I didn’t ever think I’d be the kind of person who loves other people in a romantic way, but I’m wrong so often I shouldn’t be surprised. Ever since I met her in my freshman year of high school, I’ve gotten a weird feeling when I looked into her eyes. She’s got somebody though, so I can’t tell anyone but random people on the internet through an anonymous account. 

Her eyes are so, so pretty, they’re this pale grey I’ve never seen before and they look so amazing on her dark skin and next to her dark hair and eyelashes. She’s got little moles and freckles all over her face and neck and everywhere else I’ve been lucky enough to see. One of the moles on her face, it looks just like a beauty mark, like Madonna or Marilyn Monroe. Her hair is thick and wiry like doll hair and her when she ties it up, her bangs hang over her eyes and she’s always gotta keep pushing them back up behind her ear. Her hair, it’s so short that whenever she ties it up it’ll all fall out within a few minutes but it still always looks good. 

I know exactly how much of a cliche I sound but I’ve really truly never felt this way before and it feels like going through puberty again. 

The way she says certain words will never fail to make me smile, like how it’ll sound like “a boat” when she says “about” or how she gives my name a couple extra syllables whenever she wants something from me. I hate hugs, I hate being touched, but when she hugs me and she’s so much shorter than me that I can rest my chin on her head, I wanna stand there forever, as long as nobody sees me. 

I’ll forever be jealous of the girl who managed to become her girlfriend and I really wish I’d taken advantage of my chance when I had it."
"I think if we didn't endure our grim times, we wouldn’t know what to call our enamored times we seek and turn scarlet for...I think."
"I've been meaning to start journaling. Once again, I did hours of research on how to do self-therapy in the form of journaling, and then put it off for over a month. Now I'm alone and there's nothing else to do. I have a ton of childhood trauma compressed so tightly that if I open my mouth, I should avoid open flames. And I don't want to talk about it, or even think about it, because I feel like it couldn't do me any good to dwell in the past, but I see the way it seeps out of me in my everyday behavior. I need to work through it like a bad knot in long hair. I could walk around with a rats nest on my head, or just sit down and brush it out. Whatever, fuck it, let's do it. 

I honestly debated in my head whether or not to use pronouns in my entries. Why the fuck do I care? I sometimes feel like if I am open about being female online that people don't take me seriously. I feel like pretending to be a guy is so much easier and doesn't seem as attention-seeking. Then I thought, who the fuck is actually going to read this shit?! Why should I give a fuck? Even when I'm talking in person I feel guilty about saying the word boyfriend because it feels attention-seeking. I make up these crazy boundaries to contain myself for no fucking reason. 

Anyways, my boyfriend's out of town for a business trip and fuck. He's gone three days and it is really affecting me. We haven't been apart for this long in months. I've seen him every single day for the past four months. I genuinely can't even remember how it was like when we were long-distance and couldn't see each other for months at a time. And now we've grown so much closer and dependent since 'moving in together', and I'm not sure how I'm going to cope when I go see my family for a month without him. 

I'm not sure how to explain it, but my idea of 'everyday' has changed so much since moving in here. I think about what I was like in college and I was so different. I hung out with my friends every single day. Every single day I'd see my friends, either because I lived with them or because we all met up. Now I get weird anxiety about leaving the house for too long. I get so anxious and irritable and I feel so goddamn bad for the people around me. And maybe I'm self-diagnosing it as anxiety, but that's the only way I can explain it. I get so nervous and worried and unwell when I'm away from home, away from my computer where I should be doing work. I should be doing something. It's fucking strange, though, because this place really doesn't feel like home. It's filled with things that aren't mine, and I'm just staying here. And when he's not here, fuck is it lonely. I didn't realize when he was here how different it is. I'm scared at night when he's not here, I'm fucking lonely. I don't have anyone to talk to because I barely leave the house. I just don't know what I'm doing. Pretty sure that's going to be a reoccurring theme here. Hope the next post is more positive lol"
"As the first week comes to an end of my new job, I've been reading more peer-reviewed articles from the Doctor. She insisted I read them over the weekend, which I did. There's a lot of stuff in those papers that I've never heard of before, though some of it is somewhat familiar to me. One paper talked about the biophysics of a family of proteins. It's an old article from 2012, at least considered ""old"" in the world of science. The rule of thumb is that you're supposed to read fresh articles within the last 5 years. After that, unless nothing substantial has been discovered or investigated thoroughly, it's considered ""out of date"". There's a lot of jargon and technical terminology I'm not even remotely familiar with, so it's going to take a while to process all of this new info.

Besides the theoretical stuff, I've been getting hands-on training with the instruments and techniques I'll be working with. It's been pretty nerve-wracking with all the material they're throwing at me. Everything's going so fast, which is to be expected. They want to train me as quickly as they can to get me up to snuff on every protocol necessary to perform. The Doctor put it straightforward for me: ""I want you to focus 95% of your work on the hands-on techniques."" I did actually get to try out one of the instruments on Friday by myself, which, with respects to the lab staff, is literally being held together by duct tape and loose wiring. But, despite its unappealing looks, it does work, so that's all that matters. I had a mini panic attack because at one point, one of its components stopped working, and would you believe the damn thing decided to stall on me *seconds* after my trainer left the lab? I managed to get it working again by myself, so I guess I can count that as part of the on-the-job training.

I also heard we're getting another guy to join our lab. Excellent. The more people we have, the easier it'll be to expedite our efforts for this research project, among others in the future. The trainer did tell me that once I've mastered all of the instruments and techniques, I'll be the one teaching future members. It made me feel like I truly belong here. 

I'm really happy so far with how things are going...maybe almost too happy. Knowing my history, I get worried when things seem to be going smoothly my way. I always feel like there's going to be failure around the corner and I'll come crashing down with my emotions. I need to stop thinking this way, but it isn't easy.

All I can do now is really focus on my training and keep building rapport with my teammates. If I keep this up, I'll hopefully have a better understanding of what'll lie ahead."
"We humans are an annoying species, we defy logic we saw birds fly so we built planes, we saw horses run so we built cars and we saw fish breathe under water so we built submarines. Whatever obstacle presents itself we have overcome it, and yet this will not always be true. We belive that scientist or other more important people will save us from the chaos we create and when they don't show fast enough results we call them unfit and take away their livelihood. Instead of enacting the change we belive should occur we wallow in despair and blame others for our hardships. Even now as we kill our planet we bicker over nonsense argue over materialistic things that are finite and will eventually vanish. What does humanity in its essence really mean? Is it showing kindness and affection to others or is humanity really our primal instincts of chaos and destruction. We belive that through good deeds our souls will be saved, that the sins we have committed will vanquish, however is it really that simple? For every good act there is one of evil. How can we claim that one good deed erases an evil one? Does saving a life make up for taking one away? Human history is plagued with sins, slavery, wars, the holocaust and even now sweatshops across the world. Even if every good deed took away an evil one, we would all still carry an arsenal of sins. Is humanity love and kindness or chaos and savagery? In the end it's up to you to decide I guess, will you be the change in world full of problems or will you continue in the path of indifference and let everything around you crumble away until nothing is left."
"Several things on my mind right now. I'll kick off with the first thing. I had a bad nightmare the night before--real bad. I still remember the details, and that's just how bad it was. I was trapped in some kind of well or cistern, I don't know. It was dark, very dark, with only a little bit of light coming from the surface and slowly trickling its way down to where I was. I think I was descending but I don't recall. Honestly, it felt like the entire structure of that place was alive. I don't know how to describe it, but it felt as if it was sucking me in. I remember hearing things around me, although I couldn't see them, whatever they were. But the most haunting part of that nightmare were the groans. I distinctly remember hearing these awful groaning sounds resonating from down below. They sounded painful, like someone suffering in their anguish. It sounded like men and women--sometimes separately, sometimes in unison. Just before I woke up, I remember getting a better picture of the place I was in. For a brief second, there was a flash of light that illuminated the whole area, and I could see just how enormous that place was. I can still hear those sounds reverberating from the walls of that place. At some points, I don't think they were human.

Anyway, it was just a stupid dream. I have no idea why my brain feels the need to conjure up horrific shit like that, but there you go. Onto the other thing now...

I heard from an old coworker of mine, from my last job. He was a cool guy, and he and I got along with each other. He asked me if I got a new job yet and, thankfully, I told him that I have. I asked him how the old workplace was coming along. As expected, he told me it's gotten worse. I'm not surprised. He told me that the turnover rate through not just his (our) department was increasing, but throughout the entire company. Apparently it's gotten so bad that the executives are giving out ""desperate"" bonuses to ""select"" employees in an attempt to keep them on board. He also told me there were several allegations of sexual misconduct among other employees, including the higher-ups of the company. 

I guess I should be shocked, but honestly, I saw it coming a mile away. That place was complete horseshit, and that includes my former dickhead manager. I told my old coworker he should just leave once he got another opportunity. He's seriously considering it. Good for him.

There's no point in sticking around with a company whose communication and management skills are abysmal. The fact that I saw many workers leaving within the first month of working there, spoke volumes of its administration and working environment. I don't even have them as a reference. When employers ask me why I left the company, I just tell them that I'm currently looking for ""better opportunities"" and end it on that note.

Whatever. It's in the past now. I wished him good luck and bade him farewell. 

There were other things on my mind, but that'll be the end of this entry. I guess I should be thankful for finding this better opportunity, though the pay could be better. Honestly, however, I'd rather be underpaid in a better work environment than a higher paying position with a crappy work environment. The dream job for everyone is one where you have both excellent pay and work environment, but it's not easy to find something like that. I was thinking of writing my own book as a side gig to possibly make more money, but being a writer is easier said than done. It's fine when writing these personal entries in a journal format, but actually making a story for the majority of an audience to enjoy is much more difficult. Writer's block is a pain in the ass, too, and I can only imagine being a writer for living and having a demanding publishing company hound you day after day to quickly write your story.

I'll think about it, but for now, I need to focus on my upcoming training and orientation sessions."
"It took a few simple questions from my therapist to confront it head-on. My psyche is so focused on the needs and wants of others that I've been ignoring the hard truth. I didn't want to hurt him so I ignored the source of my discontentment. I've let myself be miserable for years so that he could live in ignorance, and isn't that even more cruel? 

The thought of us splitting hurts, but not nearly as much as the thought of staying. I'm trapped in a net of my own making. I'm bound by flowery words and childish promises a decade old. I can't be beholden to the emotions of a person I no longer am anymore. It's a lie.

There is nothing he has done wrong, except for me. His faith in me; naively placed on a broken human incapable of returning such a pure intention. He is a wonder that delights and enraptures the people around him... but not me. I don't see child-like wonder; I see immature ignorance. I don't see blooming creativity; I see disordered distraction.

I am different. I don't see the world the same anymore. I'm cynical and jaded, and hard. I don't want to let anyone in because if I do, that's how they can break me again. I don't want to be alone but I don't want to hurt.

I crave connection with others but connections are dangerous. They're addictive, and hard to control, and selfish. So incredibly selfish...

He sees a future with me. 
I see an endless void with no happy endings. 

I want me.

Who am I?

Who am I?"
"The tree has always been my tree. I litterally grew up with it. It's just a special tree. It was planted as a stick and is now taller than the house with a trunk so big it would take 3 of me to wrap around it.

But my dad is getting older and he can't keep up with maintenance  of trimming or cleaning up leaves in the yard. He's called various tree trimmers to help but everyone has quoted between $800 and $1000+ and my family just doesn't have that kind  of cash.

And my dad is more bark than bite so sometimes he just says stuff to vent, but I can tell when my dad is serous anout an idea sometimes, and I think this one he's serious about. And I get it, what else can you do?

But I'm really upset about it. And there's nothing I can really do about it."
"This was while I was at work yesterday. I thought I had seen her before, but since I work at a college bookstore and have regulars, even if I had, my brain’s first response was “WOW, she is cute/pretty/beautiful/out of your league”. As such, I legitimately forgot how to do my job.

She told me what she was looking for, and I immediately turn down the wrong aisle. I catch myself and head towards the right aisle, but I forgot what she was looking for so I ask her again. I find it but then I doubt what I had picked up. I don’t even remember anything I said or did after that point because whenever I interact with a girl that pretty my brain shuts down and defaults to “make her laugh, dude, that’s all you have, don’t blow it.” Thank god she laughed at my attempts at bits and jokes, otherwise I would probably still be hiding in shame. And god damn, did she have a nice laugh. As someone with as low self-esteem as I have, if I can make a beautiful girl laugh, then I can at least justify my claims of being funny, and my brain defaults to “keep it going, she’s laughing, keep going.”

I’ve had moments of “wow, she’s pretty” while I’ve been at work before, but never enough to entirely throw me out of how to do my job. If I ever see her again, I’m sure I’ll choke the way I did yesterday. But I do hope I see her again even if it’s just so I can make her laugh again. I’d never have the cojones to find a way to ask her out in any way, and it would be especially awkward to do because I would be on the clock and that can only come across as creepy.

And I hope that I’m not coming across as creepy now. But my GOODNESS, I have never been that tongue-tied. My brain just tossed out everything about how to do my job because it was so thrown off by just how... “WOW”. Like, caps-lock “WOW”. You know? I mean, I’m not gonna track her down or stalk her or anything, that’s just creepy as hell. But since she’s a student at the school I work for, I’m just saying it’s a possibility and I hope I either can be less tongue-tied or lean into the gag harder and make her laugh more if I ever see her again.

She’s definitely out of my league, I’m just hoping I can make a beautiful girl laugh again if I can.

Anyway. That was like an hour into my shift at work and it’s all I’ve been able to think about since. I really hope that’s not creepy.

*Day-late Edit, but felt it was necessary: I’m 27, and she’s a law student, so she’s at least however old you have to be to get in to a law school. Just wanted to clarify that.*"
"I'm not in the mood to type down my thoughts right now, well, at least not too much. Some things happened recently in the family and I basically had to fix it. God, I'm just damn tired. I don't want to talk about jobs or anything like that right now. 

It never ceases to amaze me how cruel and petty people can be to each other."
I guess I didn't really expect it. I've always thought that I have a objective outlook on life. That I know how the world works. But that couldn't  be further from truth. I didn't think that I saw the good in people. But I still wondered how people could be so cruel. It still never occurred to me that that's just how the world works. That there are so many more cruel people than nice ones. I've lived in a good environment. I haven't been exposed to that kind of thing. Even when I was I didn't see it. I was blinded by the... I don't even know what.
"Who was the first person to mark a bit of clay with a slash to indicate an amount, or what was in the jar? Who was the first person to write down a thought instead of simply a picture? How did they even think to write that sentence down? Did they realize what they had done?   
I always think of these things. Improvements are more easily understood. Once you figure out how to grind flour and mix it with water and bake or fry it, then adding different stuff to it is sort of, well not small stuff, but thinking ....hmm, a bit of salt or sugar baked in will make this tastier. But thinking of all those other steps first? Grind and mix and bake. Wow, that is heavy duty thinking. Why? I mean here you are noshing on a bit of wheat nut and you think... maybe I should grind this, and get rid of these parts? I don't know how it all came about and I always wonder about these things."
"What were you thinking! Do you think people live to do you favors! Dude, don't blame people for your weakness. You decided to do this. You committed to it. And now you don't understand why are you suffering.

I wanted to do a good job. Even if it took longer. So, here I am. But now you are buckling under pressure. Well, you have been through worst already. You have gone through agony and now you have accepted. Good. Now it's time to make the most of the situation."
"Sometimes I wonder if there is something wrong with me. 
In the way I think and experience the world.
I feel it's either something very real or something very in my head.
It could possibly be my thyroid and hormones causing me to feel unstable or to question myself.
It could be that this is an old demon back from when my parents told me that my councilor thought I had Aspergers and how that made me feel. It was terrible, it made me question myself. I remember asking myself if I was different in my head as I would fall asleep, my poor 14-15 year old mind would question itself and I couldn't ever conclude anything. 
I fear that there is all sorts wrong with me and none at the same time. If I don't have issues then why have I done nothing with my life? Am I too comfortable? Do I need to get out of my parents house? Would being on the streets sleeping in my car give me more motivation to actually succeed? To build my own life? Am I too comfortable? Do I spemd too much and have too much handed to me? Why do I work a $10 an hour job at 20? I could be in a factory making 1000s more, I could be doing so much more. Do I believe it'd be too hard? Do I not want to give up weed? Do I overthink things? Is this ADHD? Do I have issues? How can I fix my issues? Where are my thyroid meds? Why don't i look for them? Why am I on the couch still? Why have i not moved? What am I doing? What is my goal? Why do i? Why am I sleeping at a girls apartment, why do I seek love instead of success? Why am I naked not in the shower? Why did I waste so much time in school? Why have I been hiding from my parents? Why is my mind so goofed and fucked up feeling? Is it imaginary? Am I doing it? Am I making things hard on myself? Do I love myself? Why do I think about people I shouldn't, why do I think about others thoughts? Why does it make me uncomfortable and less likely to wamt to do what i wanted to do when i know other people's thoughts? Why do i sacrifice my own happiness? What makes me happy? Am I depressed? Why am I typing to Reddit? What's my purpose? Do I have an obsessions? I've got a few but am I obsessing correctly? Are they actually anchoring me? Why do I feel so complex? Why do I feel like shattered glass?"
"I'm looking forward to today, at least forward to the afternoon. Morning will be devoted to getting as many of the dishes (which migrated to the sinks after I had done them all already, ungrateful creatures) done as possible and getting as much laundry done as well. I have about four baskets to fold and put away. Fun, fun, fun, yep. I'll probably just watch Dark or Memories of Alhambra or both while I do. Or start something new? Not sure.

But this afternoon, off to get more yarn from the city. Because of that very fun thing called finances and lack of that very important item called money, I can only purchase a few skeins of yarn at a time, three or four maybe? And I, perhaps unwisely, didn't want to satisfy myself with a single color, and then change out after making blocks of color. So I'm just crochet a bunch of rows in one color, switching to another and so forth. And then get a few more colors, same thing. Only I, rather unwisely, chose to do the end in a different pattern than the middle. So I kind of want the ends to be the same color?

Only you can't really do yarn that way.

Colors, even the same colors, are off a bit if they are made in a different batch. But what can I do? We make our choices, and I made mine. So I'm hoping to find that the colors match enough that being on the ends of the afghan the differences won't be evident. That or the end rows will need to be in different colors completely. 

I will need to get, eventually, about six of one particular color. Dark color something. Dusky black, heatherish, to fit with the theme. Probably the next trip out. Have that color a solid in the middle, and then as trim all around the edges. It will take me awhile to finish the whole thing, as I want it long, and I'm not the best at crochet.

Began my new journal today. Last night as I went to close my old journal, a small one, with creamy yellow paper and a pretty blue cover, I felt this weird sense of nostalgia. Last time writing in this journal! So I wrote a kind of thank you note to the journal at the end, and ""retired"" plus the date. Weird, weird, weird. And I've retired journals before, don't know where this sense of needing closure is coming from, except, well, I've been journaling more regularly now, with a sense of duty almost, writing about journaling, adding drawings or mementos to the journal - all sorts of things, where in early days I'd just write. But having a format, things I've obligated myself to add, has made journaling less of a release and more of a process of finding who I am. And that has changed me.

My new journal, well I'm not happy with the paper as it is thinner and not all inks work well, but just like I wasn't happy with the cover and then decorated it to make it my own, so I will find a solution to the thinness of the paper. Switching pens, or finding thicker paper which I can glue to the pages when I want heavier ink. In a way that makes it better than if everything were perfect to begin with. Brings out the creative side within me. 

I'm already thinking of a new type of journal, I'll see, where each day is kept in a sort of envelope, with some things written on the envelope, and something placed inside, such as my writing, or things I've drawn, or to-do list. Each day would be like that, and then the month would be kept together in a different, larger envelope, that I decorate. The year would be a box of some sort - shoe box or whatever. Kind of like writing a letter to myself, and each one a mini gift. Needs some work, needs some thought. I probably won't begin that till the next year.

Wow, am I gabby today."
"My husband and I have an appointment in the city today, so off we go in about an hours time. It isn't a big deal meeting, though it is something we shouldn't miss. The trip is so long though, about 1.5 hours, well for me that is long, and by bus/train/bus. Then the meeting, and then back again. So the whole day seems gone. 

Good thing though: I'm getting a new journal as my old one is almost full. I think I will go bigger this time, a nice sized one, though I still want one, I think, that can be easily carried about. I haven't quite decided. I'll see when I get to the store. Currently I have one that is palm size.

I might get new pens and markers as well, depending on how expensive the journal is. My favorite place to shop for this type of stuff closed down, which is sad, and there is only one other place in the area where I'll be in which I can find the items I need. But they are a nice art store, so I'm certain I'll find something."
"Another job interview for tomorrow. This time it's an onsite one, which surprises me because they skipped the preliminary screening phase. Either they're desperate for someone to join their team or my CV must've looked really good. The job is from a legit hospital, a rather well-known one, but regardless a job is a job. I also got another call for an onsite interview next week. I would love to say I'm excited, but the truth is that it'll only take one person to say, ""I don't like this guy--don't hire him"", and I'll be back in the fray.

I know what they're going to ask me: employment history, behavioral questions, long-term goals question, and then maybe a few technical stuff. The technical testing doesn't really concern me because of how entry-level this position is, and that they only require basic, textbook-level knowledge with research lab experience. It's academia so it won't be as rigorous as my last job, which was in industry. I've done academia before but I had hoped in staying in industry for a while. Then I got stuck with that craptastic job that I don't ever want to see again.

The pay is going to be lower than my previous job, but I'll be damned if I put my sanity in jeopardy in dealing with a horrible boss, god-awful management and the overall depressing mood of that place. This place seems happier, but there's only one way to find out: getting in.

I can't celebrate or say anything until I hear the magical words ""job offer"". There are other candidates who are most likely gunning for the position as well, and, per usual in life, there's always someone smarter and more experienced than you in something--anything.

I would love to write more, but this is starting to get my anxious. Wish me luck for tomorrow."
"I have never had a really good relationship with my father. And the worst part is that I did not realize it till very late. I thought it was normal for fathers to have this weird hateful relationship with their sons. I am not into sun-signs and astrology, but god damn, if this man doesn't show the classic Gemini traits. He would be all loving and caring for some weeks and then next moment he would tell me that I was dead to him as a son. Or make some equally hurting remark about my work or my studies. Even the small things that I did not do good at, like cleaning his vehicle or polishing his shoes, or learning to drive...I'd get scolded to hell and back. So much so, it created a fear in me for trying new things. The learning process should not be motivated by fear, but by an interest for learning something. For me, it was fearful all along the way, I knew I'd fuck up and get a verbal lashing and no matter how hard I tried, I would fuck up, because my father was a lousy teacher.

It took me a long time to properly learn to drive a two-wheeler because my father would not or could not explain to me how the fucking machine worked because he did not know it himself. Even today, his driving is far worse than anyone on the road. It drives me mad.

He always made promises to a younger me that he would do this or do that but never fulfilled those promises. Maybe he hid the information from me on purpose or maybe that's his nature by now.

Now, in his old age, he has become a needy, whining, scheming, and negative person and there are days when I feel like my life had to go through extra roadblocks because of my father. Everything and anything I'd want to do, he'd stick his leg into it and not let me do it. Everything I do has to go through him because if it doesn't, he'd hold a grudge for the next time when I have to do something. If I wanted to fly, he has been like an iron ball around my ankles.

In turn, it has impacted my personality too. I have become a bitter person in many ways and I hate myself when I see my behavior reflecting that of my father. The mood swings, the anger outbursts, the long-winded grudges, they are all his behaviors that have trickled down into my personality and it's like pushing a boulder up a hill when I try to correct this faults. Doesn't help that it pisses me off that I am behaving like him.

'Our fathers were our role models for God and if our fathers bailed on us, what does that teach us about God?'

Many men and boys look up to their father and want to be like him. And here I am, thinking of ways to distance my behavior as far away as I can from this man.

He is my father at the end of the day, even with all his faults and problems he has created in my life. The times he misguided me, the times he didn't offer me support when I needed it, the times he flat out blasted me for voicing my opinions, the times he took out his life's frustrations on me for no fault of my own. And all the times that he said bitter things to me. I remember it all. I can't forget it.

I love and respect him to the best of my abilities, though. It's not easy on the best of days. Some days, I feel it would be better for both of us if he would disown me publicly.

My only aim now is to be a better father for my son.

I just needed to get all this off my chest.

Sigh."
"Dear A,

Yesterday was wonderful. Though we really should have tried harder to sleep the night before. We stayed up all night on Tuesday talking and dreaming, laughing and making love. In the darkness as we lay down to try to sleep, when I could not see your face and you could not see mine I finally said ""I love you"". I was so scared and yet it felt right. You were so happy, so excited- you told me you had been planning to say it too. 

We gave up on sleeping, and i decided it was time to get up and start  the day. I fed my pets while you dressed and then we got in the car for a long drive. I told you that the drive to where we were going took two hours, but together it felt like only twenty minutes. We go there too early and none of the cute little shops were open so we walked and talked and found ourselves in a cemetery. 

We looked at the dates and the names and pointed out family's and generations. We tried to be respectful and not step on anyone. As stores began to open we walked through looking at the antiques and you lit up like a kid in a candy store when we found the cool knife displays- you're such a boy. We found a room full of Christmas decorations (even in April) playing Christmas music, and we started to dance as if it had occurred to us at the same time. We do that a lot- move and think as if we are two halves of a whole. 

We bought a picnic blanket and looked for somewhere to sleep away from other people, but while walking over to our chosen spot you slipped on a log and fell down hurting your hand something fierce. I laughed at first and then I realized how much it hurt. We ended up deciding to go home and I made a 'bandage' out of some dunkin doughnuts napkins and a scrunchy to staunch the bleeding until we could get home to a first aid kit. 

I know people who when hurt, lash out at those around them- you didn't do that. Even later when I poured peroxide on your wound and peeled off a layer of gunk and it hurt so very much, you did your best not to flinch away and were so very careful to not startle me or scare me by yelling out.

We fell asleep then, curled around one another in bed too exhausted to stay awake for more than a few moments. When I woke you up so we could go to dinner you didn't complain. You never do, even though I am a morning person and you are not. Even though my cats love you so much they fall asleep between your legs and you are much too nice to move them. 

We went to dinner and a movie, and when we got back you had to go home. I tried and failed at not showing my disappointment. I know I shouldn't monopolize you. I keep reminding myself that it has only been a few months, that you have a home and a life outside of me and I have to let you live it, that I want you to live it."
"I'm officially out of that damn job. Thank GOD! Phew! Seriously, it's a huge relief not working in a place like that anymore. In the meantime, I've been hunting for other positions. There's this one position in particular that strikes my fancy, but we'll see how long it takes for these guys to get back to me. Usually with large companies like that, it could take a few months to get back to me.

As for work on the side, I might just pop back into academia for the time being, just so I can help in whatever research they're doing--maybe cancer or diabetes research, I don't know. I honestly don't care too much of the nature of the work, just as long it's directly helping patients. The pay will be abysmal but it should be only temporary, if that's what they're looking for. We'll see.

On a side note, I did get in touch with the police overseas and they said they'd take a look into my accusations. Again, it's armchair detective work, and all I'm doing right now is a preliminary investigation--an *unofficial* preliminary investigation. I have to just let the authorities do their job and answer what they ask for, nothing more or less.

I feel much better now, but not much, though I'm happy to say that my brother and sister have successfully passed their freshman year and will be heading into their finals week soon."
"Summer. 

During my teen years. Our teen years. My brother’s and mine. 

The night breeze was slowly cooling the house down from the season’s brutal heat. The band of crickets were at it again, though the loud croaking wasn’t there. Dad found the toad that somehow hopped its way into our garden pond. He relocated it, worried that the dogs might kill it. 

I found Kuya checking his face out in front of the huge white-framed mirror inside my room, fussing over things that needed to be fussed about. I was about to take a bath and went in to get a change of clothes. 

*Why are you wearing a white tee?*

I responded with a shrug because really, I just picked the first thing that my eyes landed on. And who even asks such a question. Why are you wearing this shirt, that shirt at home. Well, that’s because I am?

*You were wearing [can’t recall the color] awhile ago?When you came in here? You did came in here literally seconds ago right?*

Oh, that was why.

I said yes even if I did none of those. He returned to what he was doing. Got my clothes. Went out the room. Saying no would just frighten him and a scared [Kuya’s name] would just frighten me as well, especially since we were the only ones at home that time. 

I never asked if he was kidding or not, but he usually isn’t, scares too easily with the “Unexplained”. Besides, it was probably just a brain fart or something. 

Pero tarantado lang. Nakakahawa yung paranoia pagdating sa halimaw, impakto’t kung ano-anumang lamanglupang type na kababalaghan yan. Letse.

Why I remembered this:  Watched Cube (1997). Possibly? No clue why I retrieved that memory. Cube is still good.

*Worth: Because it's here. You have to use it, or you* *admit it's pointless.*

"Life is going fine, if what I have for a life can be termed as fine. The wife is good, the kiddo is the light of my life, I am on good terms with my parents and my sibling, but there is this sense of dread that everything will taken away from me in a fell swoop. That men in police uniform will be knocking on the door some day telling me that, sir, it's all over, time to pay for your sins. What sins, I will ask. And they will not tell me. It's not healthy living like this. The sense of a hammer hanging over your head with a web string. 

&#x200B;

Professionally, I feel stuck in a jam. I am not able to give my work as much attention because now the kiddo is going to school and I can't really sit up till late to work because if I don't sleep on time, I won't be able to wake up on time. My days of pulling late shift till 3 AM are gone when I have to wake up at 6 AM sharp or the whole days goes haywire. Theoretically, I can function on 4 hours of sleep, but then the day is long and there is no possibility of a nap anywhere. I wish I had more time in the day, but where do I squeeze it from? I might be moving cities in some time, this when I was just starting to like this city after five years of hating it here. 

&#x200B;

I really need friends. 

Three good things.

1) I am walking 10,000 steps every day. 

2) Caine Black Knife audiobook is so good.

3) There is coffee. "
"Kindergarten. 

The rubber eraser was pink. Smelled like sweet bubble gum too. Maybe that’s why I liked it so much. Can’t really tell. All I can remember is that I loved that eraser.

It was during class. We were writing something. Drawing? No. Writing. Practicing our alphabets. Tons of yellow wooden pencils swaying in the air. Someone’s handwriting pressure on our table was too hard. The roaming teacher said so. 

A boy seated in front of me asked if I had an eraser that he could borrow. Can’t recall what’s wrong with the one that comes with the pencil that he was holding. I hesitated to answer honestly because it was a favorite and wanted to keep it for myself, though I said yes anyways.

I was done with my written activities and had to get up to submit my paper. Told him to just leave my stuff on my space in the table. He smiled then nodded. I got up.

Some time passed before I returned to my assigned seat. Probably played a bit with other kids in other tables, rewarded myself for the hardwork. Haha. When I finally returned, my heart sank to my knees as I saw my precious eraser with several holes around it. 

Someone poked it with a pencil! 

I played detective and tried to find out who did it by requesting the pencils of those who I saw present in the table and is within arm’s reach from my working space. The plan was if the pencil’s lead tip is a snug fit to the holes then I got the culprit. 

It was sadly inconclusive so I just decided that if nobody admits who did it then all of the people seated in the table or near me was guilty and owed me a pink, bubble gum-scented eraser. 

Can’t quite recall if anyone did gave me some or what I did next. 
"
"I got a call from my brother. He told me he aced both exams at his college. Nice! See? I knew he could do it! He worries so much, but I suppose it's natural when it comes to going to school. 

One thing that did concern me was that incident that happened a month ago near his dorm. A man--a kid, about 17-years old--was stabbed repeatedly by his fellow gang member. Apparently the two had their own internal drug deal going down, and the other guy, the murderer, was trying to rip his victim off. When the victim called him out on it, he got angry and pulled out a knife (a kitchen knife) and stabbed him again and again, killing him. I seriously doubt any of those elements would reach my brother's campus, but still, that city has a god-awful reputation. As usual with many parts in the world, poverty and corruption is a gigantic magnet for crime.

Joining a gang...what a horrible outcome. These youngsters need to keep in mind that joining a gang is a commitment. They really don't understand what they're getting themselves into until they're forced to do it. And, of course, there's the possibility--the high possibility--of getting caught or killed. God help you if you're forced to murder someone that you love or have known since childhood, just to prove your loyalty. On the news the other day, I watched as an 18 and 20-year old were sentenced to life in prison with no parole. The reason? They started shooting at someone they thought was a rival gang member, their target. It turned out to be the wrong person, someone who had no gang affiliation whatsoever. But, too little, too late, as they realized they'd just killed an innocent man.

What a pitiful way to live. Such a senseless waste of life, and those potential talent and skills that could've been used to make the world a better place for them and the people around them, it all ended being squandered on petty conflicts. I'm so glad I never joined a gang. I was so close--so, so damn close. But look at them now: they're all dead or in prison. It's so damn easy to let your anger and blinding hatred get the best of you. And you think you can fix everything in your life by rolling with a bunch of guys who say they'll protect you and love you as a brother. And then you actually see the shit they do and the people they contend with--the life they're forced to live, if you can even call it a life.

That was years ago, though. I'm a new man now. Nobody from those hoods would ever believe that I became a scientist. They probably wouldn't even recognize me anymore. Good. I don't want to remember any of them, and the older I get, the better it becomes as I have their memories fade away from my recollection.

Wow, this entry got *real* dark, huh? I don't even know why I'm talking about something like this. I guess it's because I actually have someone from my family that I love. See, that's the difference these bangers won't understand. I have a brother who'll love, protect and trust me because of our bond together. You guys? You guys are completely paranoid, always wondering who's watching you and who'll backstab you at any second...or ""frontstab"" you over a baggie of weed."
"It's raining again, and I hear the weather is going to be iffy this weekend and next week. Well, I'm pretty much used to it. Yeah, nothing much to worry about today, and nothing really to talk about. When it starts raining and the gray clouds come out and play, I feel so slow. This weather reminds me of a certain day that I don't want to talk about. Perhaps some other time when I get the courage.

I really wish I had more for this entry, but there really is nothing else to say. Maybe tomorrow, then."
"I went to the art gallery today, or rather, as it's called, the art museum. Actually, museum is correct, considering there are artifacts on display. It's always nice to explore stuff like that. It reminds you what humanity actually is, and that is there is something deep in our souls to express ourselves on some type of medium, painting or otherwise. It sounds extremely corny when I type that down, but you know what, I'm going to leave it.

Doing scientific research and working to make a living is nice and all, but it does get tiresome. I think it's fair to say that's with any job. Sometimes you need to walk around and take a break, and what better way than to appreciate art from different centuries from different people of different cultures. 

I love the contemporary art galleries, although I can understand why it gets so much critique. Still, I love looking at it, and a lot of it is bursting with bright colors. There was this one somber gallery, however, that was not so colorful. The entire room was pitch black...well, almost pitch black. In the room, there was a massive projector displaying on the wall a film of a woman talking about how her brother struggled with cancer. It showed black and white pictures of the patient from when he was healthy, to when he was diagnosed, and finally on his deathbed. Somber is the word I use, but there's no word to describe how heavy the atmosphere of that room was. The way he becomes emaciated is so scary...I really don't know how to put it. It was certainly a dark contrast to what I had seen in the previous galleries, though it's obvious that's what the artist was going for, right?

I think there were other places within the museum I could've gone to, but my legs and shoulders were getting tired from all the walking and standing. 

I really should look into contemporary art more often."
"Yesterday I got a rude call from an asshole recruiter.  I've nothing against recruiters in general, just so you know, but this guy...oh, man, what a piece of work.  He's been calling me again and again, and despite me telling him I'm not interested in any of the positions he has to sell, he's been adamant in thinking I'll bend over and accept whatever he's got to offer.  Honestly, he wasn't that bad at first, but he got progressively worse and worse over time.  The final straw is when he called me up, yesterday, and asked me if I ""wanted a job or what"".  Christ, what a prick.  I don't want to get too much into detail because I was salty about it all day.  Long story short, I ended up blocking his number and messaged his managers to never have this cock call me again.  I was \*this\* close in telling him to ""fuck off"", but I decided to bite my tongue and do it professionally.  I never want to hear from that company ever again.

Anyway, with that off my chest, I'm still awaiting from my contact in the state police and the other pharma companies.  I should make a call to my other recruiter--the one who's not a shitbird--and ask if a certain position is available.  This job hunting business is starting to grind my gears again, but I really don't have much of a choice.  Yeah, I have a job, but I keep harping on about how this one sucks--and it \*does\* suck.  Maybe I should just hold up a sign with my CV attached to it outside one of these big companies and see if one of their scientists will come outside and greet me.  I'd probably get kicked off the property by their security, or worse, have the cops tell me to bugger off.

Ugh...what else?  What else, what else?  Well, I did make clam chowder last night and it tasted good.  I didn't use a heavy cream recipe; instead, I went with half & half.  I guess it's a more healthy version of clam chowder?  I use the word ""healthy"" very loosely, though, because this stuff still has bacon, dairy and sodium, all ingredients thrown in to slowly kill your heart.  Fuck it, I'm not gonna live forever.  

I'm gonna keep applying for more positions and see if there's anything new to the list.  They say getting your foot in the door is the first step with these guys, but at this point I need my \*feet\*, just to make a good impression on them."
"Dear Diary

Stupid DST.  Stupid store for not having my breaky stuff.  Stupid lack of sleep. Stupid cat for thinking I'm a pin cushion.  

Time is fluid.  Yet so many moments slip past us...gone never to be seen again except in our memories.  I really miss the ones where I was sleeping.

"
"Dear Diary,

Well, a decent day finally.  Not a great one, but good enough to appreciate it.  Up too early, but got a nap in and made some awesome hamburgers. Dinner was good too.  

Hoping tomorrow decides to be decent too."
"Dear Diary.

Another blah day.  TBH, I'm getting tired of saying it.  But I'm struggling to get a handle on my emotions, and saying it is supposed to help me process them or something.  Self realization and all that.  So, yay, go me.

I'm really starting to feel the lack of friendship.  Sure, S and I do practically everything together.  But that's what spouses do.  At least, us.  I don't understand why friendship is so hard for me.  I've done it before.  I've had people I could be friendly with.  People that I could care about.  Now...  now it just doesn't seem possible for me.

But this closed offness that I've been feeling is starting to grate on me. I know the problem is mine and that this is something I need to work on.  In...what?  Desperation?  Sure, let's go with that.  In desperation I've even thought about going back to church.  Not that I'm going to necessarily believe in what they're saying.  But it's going to be a way to be social and meet other people.  Surely I can't be the only person to use church for a social venue.  

I thought about some kind of sporting activity.  Regrettably the only thing I would good at right now would be an individual activity and not a team one.  I will keep my eyes open though. 

Since I'm trying to be positive, I'm going to go with a positive song.  *I Will Survive*"
"I remember when I got them. Distant relatives knew of two cats who had kitten. It must have been December 2009. Ten years ago. 
Snow outside and two kitten being tugged in, cuddling each other in a box. 
They were barely 8 weeks old. 
A ginger tabby and a black and white one.
I immediately fell in love with the ginger one.
We took him. But we simply couldn‘t leave the other one alone. They were brothers after all.

It was hard enough to convince my Mom to get a cat. The responsibility and the money...and my Mom was afraid of cats since she once witnessed a cat attacking and biting a man when she was little. 
Could we leave the other cat in the box when the two brothers just cuddled earlier?
„We can‘t leave the other one here!“ Mom said.
Could I take both cats? 
Two cats when my Mom wasn‘t even too fond of the thought of letting me have one cat?
Could I keep both cats? Mom nodded.
It was almost Christmas and I had two male kitten. Tiny kitten that were just 8 weeks old (a bit too early!) and they kept on sucking on our clothes.

I named the black and white one Elvis and the ginger one Toulouse. 
Elvis would give us literal kisses and not only headbutts. I remember him licking off my tears when I was in bed crying.

He‘s 10 years old now. He stopped eating and we went to the vet. The blood result said something is wrong with his kidneys.
We tried it with injections for more than a week but the blood results were still bad.
They showed us is kidneys on the screen.
A tiny shrinking one and a giant one with inflammation and cysts. There are toxins in his body and he is suffering. He lost 2kg within one week.
The vet said he has to be put to sleep.
The appointment is on Friday.

It hurts.

"Recently  I've been feeling a very strong emotion, a need for intimacy, to be  close to someone, but not anyone.  I feel like a void inside of me that  wants to be filled, it's just that I don't know what will do.  I've  tried alcohol, weed, sex, video games, porn, exotic food, travel, and none of  it makes a dent.  

&#x200B;

No wonder, these activities were all a momentary  pleasure, but that's not what my void is looking for. It  has to be something more permament, transcendent even, something that  gives meaning to my life.  This would make sense but this is not a  search for meaning, it is for a strong connection to someone, to a  woman.

&#x200B;

Almost all my adult life I've had very  short relationships.  Ever since the fiasco that was my first and only  LTR I've been looking for momentary pleasure, to increase notches, the  latest conquest, with ever increasing difficulty until I reached beyond  the limits of my imagination. 

&#x200B;

Just as in  new activities and hobbies when you're enamored with all the different  and exciting possibilities that await you, there comes the grind also  known as the law of diminishing returns.  All work is grind but you  already know that, you are just there for the money and/or prestige (and  perhaps because it is the only skill you have that you can leverage for  a good standard of living, to be comfortable). 

&#x200B;

Back  to my seduction habits, it has become a grind.  Am I tired of the game  of seduction?  I certainly love a new conquest and the very fact that  someone can become obsessed with me.  Not really with me, but with their  idea of me that they created in their mind to feed their ego.  Anyway,  yes I'm tired.  It has become a pointless endeavor.   To seek momentary  pleasure for its own sake is not worth it.

&#x200B;

On  hindsight, I could have had a relationship with almost all of the women  I was dating.  Whenever they got to close and clingy by my standards I  turned them away and disapeared.  I was doing to them what they all fear  the most, abandonment from a man worthy of their love.  Why am I  feeling this now?  Is this some sick divine punishment where I yearn  strongly for something I had disdain before?  What am I doing with my  life?

&#x200B;

I have a good job but its not what I'm  passionate about, its not what I want to do.  I'm actually waiting for  the family business to prosper, to breathe a new life after almost going  under.  The phoenix will rise again and yet I'm feeling powerless  waiting for him.  The disparity between where I am and where I want to  be is making me anxious.  Could this be the answer I was looking for?   Not really, but it's an important factor for sure.

&#x200B;

Living  in a new city without much friends and family makes me feel a bit  lonely.  I think this loneliness mixed with my other anxiety is the main  reason for my despair.  Now I know how to fight back!"
"Dear Diary

So I was listening to my music while trying to work, and the song of the day came on.  At the time I started hearing it, it wasn't sotd material. The memories, of that song, that made it so.  

I first heard this song in a TV show.  I won't get into the show too much because it's not important, but when the song played is.  Up to this episode, one of the main characters was lost.  Wandering.  Missing an old love.  Not that I have that problem, but the wandering feeling I very much identify with.  At the end of this episode, when this song plays, it's a moment of trust.  It's a moment of the start of a friendship.

Friendship is something I told myself that I didn't need.  But now I'm starting to feel the lack of that.  Aquaintances just don't do it for me anymore.  I want to care about people and have them care about me. I want to be that stray thought that pops into someone's head, and instead of being 'Ew' I want it to be a good thing.

And then I asked myself, what else am I lying to myself about?  What else affects me that I've told myself in the past that doesn't bother me?  I don't have the answers yet, but the fact I'm so good at lying to myself and wanting to believe me is scary.  

Diary, I like to think I'm loyal.  I like to think I'm the kind of person people like.  At least, not actively hate.  But truth be told there's always that doubt.  There's always a question of are people just being nice and tolerating me, or is it genuine. I wonder if that is just me lying to myself or how things really are.

Sorry, Diary.  Today the song shall remain nameless.  I use the sotd to give a little flavor to what I'm feeling.  It puts a piece of my heart into the post, and makes it more personal to me.  But today's song...  is going to put more out there than I'm comfortable putting there.  "
"Here are a couple entries on some dates I've daydreamed about for next year with a special someone. I hope these can give someone a smile as they have made me very happy.

*****

I want to go out to a coffee shop with you. I want to sample some scrumptious pastries with you as we start our day together. I know I can be me with you, you get me and I get you. We've known each other for our most important years so far and honestly I'm beginning to just feel at home around you. As we leave our cozy little coffee shop we walk down the streets of a town marked by a gentle snowfall the night before. We chat and playfully hold hands as we go on our way, you looking away to smile as you catch me holding a glance too long. I just can't get over how cute you are when you smile, and the little expressions you make as you talk are so captivating to me. I can't help it :). We wander into a petshop to see some cute animals and you're especially fond of a little puppy we encounter. You know you wouldn't be able to care for a puppy right now, but you still tease me for not offering to buy it for you as we walk out the door. We head to your apartment to relax for a bit before I have to go back home. Our schools may not be too far away, but the distance still bothers me. I wish I could see you every day, planning little surprises to make you happy. Those moments I can make you smile mean the world to me. 

*****

I want to share responsibilities with you. I often ponder the simple pleasures of preparing a meal together. After a day in the town, we can't decide on where to eat. We bicker a bit about what we're craving, but we finally decide not to decide. You suggest we stop by the local grocery store and whip up a combo of our favorite tastes together, and I love it. We race around the aisles, taking turns being the mature one as we eagerly select our perfect ingredients. When we get to the checkout we split the bill, clumsily celebrating our emerging adulthood. I love your maturity, always considerate but always willing to have some fun. We get back to your apartment and it's time to prepare our feast! As you tie your hair back I stop to admire your gracefulness, and to smile at how lucky I am to have met you. You smile back as you realize I'm still holding the groceries. You must think me mad for getting captivated so easily, but with you I just can't help it :). We start on our dishes independently, but slowly end up spending more and more time side by side as we find ourselves needing help (and maybe just wanting to be closer too). We relax for a while as our meal cooks in the oven... BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEEEEEP!!!!! I recognize that lethal tone anywhere. The blue shell takes me out as you breeze across the finish line. My arguments for a rematch are underscored by a ""ding"" of the oven. I've never had such a rewarding defeat. Your idea turned out perfectly, and together we decide that no meal is more romantic than one you prepare together. "
"Life has been a lot.

I hit a bad patch and didn't pick up my meds, queue me getting super bad again, I barely even remember what happened, I know I took a lot of drugs and drank a lot.

I did get to see the prodigy for free, it was a lot of fun but I went to work after drunk and I feel quite guilty about that, I apologized and owned it but still, I was not at my best and I expect better of myself.

Speaking of work, it's really good but it's also hard, not for the type of work, it's tiring but easy on that front no, it's the internal politics.
There's so much tension between people and everyone seems to turn to me about even though I'm the new person and I run at the bottom of things, my floor manager even asked me to talk to one of the other floor stuff because he was scared to, like what is that :/

But other side of all this is I also got to see Twrp and nsp and cried a bit at seeing Danny there, there's been some deep dark times where his dumb jokes have kept me from doing some terrible things to myself and just seeing him in the same physical space as me hit me on a emotional level I didn't expect.

I finally made it to a kink event too, I got the night off last minute and I got to go with F and it was so great specially cause J was there, J did a corset piercing there a d that was bliss and then I got to see J pour was on F and it was super cute, much compersion.

It was nice being in that environment again and finally getting to both do a scene and be the sub for it after years of being the Dom, we plan on doing feathers next time and I'm so excited.

My computer situation is getting worse though, my nice keyboard had it's cable chewed on by a cat and it's cutting out so soon I won't have a working computer on any level, the laptop I use the keyboard on has a dead one built in and there's no fixing it, my dreams of making music are further away than ever, my benefit also lapsed today because my social worker dropped the ball in sending my documentation through so that's a huge load of stress on me.

Things are so mixed and things are still so hard but I'm trying."
"I had originally posted this in a journaling reddit and was redirected here as it is more appropriate for what I want or need out of this.

Where to start..

Not that anyone cares.

I hope you can understand the tones of my *italics.*

I'll never get into my age or where I am from, I don't think that part really matters. These are just my brain fragments and psychiatric spirals being spewed upon a random internet thread.

This is more for myself then anyone, I am going though things, always have been kind of, and writing has always been therapeutic. I had always been in AP English classes throughout my brief school career. That and art are really my only strong suits. I stopped for a really long time because once someone I so cared for came across my writings of my truth and my philosophy and it hurt them. It really changed the whole dynamic of my families life and lead to what I believe was the butterfly effect of what my life is currently, right now. Not that my life is bad. Just saying, like all of us, I am constantly caught up in the *what if?*

(Story for a different time.)

I didn't ever want to do that again, so I just stopped writing entirely.. and it's been *years*.

But I need this right now.. and if you decide to read on and find something that can either help you, you can relate to, make you feel not alone, or just find plain interesting, then welcome. I guess that's kind of why I chose reddit to do this.

This will probably end up as a series as I will be making other entries.

And no one will probably read it. And that's okay too.

I'll call myself Tania. I don't want to use my actual name or the names of my loved ones because I want to be able to be as candid as I possibly can.

I am a *kind of* a single mom and it is the best blessing. Best thing that ever happened to me. My son(we'll call him Wade) and I have a man we love very much in our life, my significant other. We'll call him Ben. He is not Wades bio dad, but he is Wades father. Has been there since 3. Ben and I aren't married. Ben and Wade and extremely bonded. Just a little history for ya. I will try to explain as best I can when I do my entries.

So today and yesterday were mostly wonderful days. See my sons birthday was yesterday so its been his birthday weekend. Yesterday was the party with family and today was the party with his school friends at a child establishment that does such events. All in all it was successful on both ends. My son is happy as hell and all is beautiful in his world, so the most important priority is taken care of, that being his joy and peace of mind of course.

But something inside me is just sad. I feel like I try so hard to do my best with all things I am faced with in life and it just goes so unnoticed by everyone around me. And don't get me wrong, I know you don't reward a fish for swimming and most of these things in life are just things adults do, but just once, I would like someone to say to me that they saw my effort. The love and care I put into it. That I did a good job. I don't know if I sound whiny. And I am sorry if it comes across as such.

I am honestly just hurt.

Its like even when shit is good in my life, that black cloud is always following me. Sometimes I create it for myself, sometimes I think others bring it upon me.. idk.

I *am* crazy, but I'm *not*. There are valid reasons I feel this way, but a lot of times I can get emotional or over react. But a lot of times I don't know if I am being told by people I love and trust that I am over emotional and sensitive when I have every right to be as upset as I am, so they don't have to face their own wrongs? As you can see, my mind is already going a million different places and we haven't even reached the tip of the ice berg. We ain't even on the boat sailing to that bitch yet, guys.

So back to my sons birthday. If you are a parent of a child who has a birthday in the winter time, you know planning just one party alone is difficult because it has to be inside and you have just a lot of friggin planning to do. It's not like you can just throw the BBQ on in the backyard and let kids run around and play games.

You have to book the place.

Pay the deposit.

Send the invites.

Hound down the parents for the RSVPS. (WHICH IS A CRAPSHOOT SOMETIMES.)

Get the food.

Get the Cake.

Make sure everyone is coming one last time.

And then some people who RSVPd yes still don't come and then some come with 4 more guests you didn't expect as well.

Decorations.

Drinks.

GIFTS.

Goodie bags.

Make all the conformations the day before. and the morning of.

Make sure NO ONE is bored.

Make all the rounds.

The list goes on and on..

And I threw 2 of these parties (the family one not being so extravagant because, ya know- fam, but still) because I love my baby and I would throw him 10 if that's what I needed to do.

And this doesn't include bringing in all the goodie bags to the kids in his class for his bday there too. For some reason where I am from it is customary on your birthday to bring your classmates in something as well. When I was a kid it was usually cupcakes or some confectionery item, but because of allergies and all now-a-days, kids usually do coloring books or things of that sort to hand out.

OH YEAH AND THAT INCLUDES *THE VALENTINES* (its February) I HAND DREW FOR HIS 21 CLASSMATES TOO BECAUSE MY SON LOVES MY DOODLES AND THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED.

Like I said it *never* ends. And also like I said I would do it *over* and *over* again if I had to. And I will be there to do it for the rest of his life. And honestly, 80% of the time I don't mind doing it at all because I can be anal retentive and a perfectionist so I love creating events and themes and parties and stuff like this.

.. but I just get *no* love and support. And I really don't mind doing shit on my own because I kind of like to do things *my* way, I know I sound like a total prick. Whatever. But I just want a fucking pat on the back every once and awhile. Again sorry if I sound like I am victimizing myself. And sorry about the language.

A lot of it comes from my father, grandfather, and Ben. If I am being completely honest. And this is not to demonize any of the 3 because I love them all so much with all my spiritual and physical being. But I just gotta say how I feel. 

My dads *never* really been there and that's *also* a story for a different time. 

My Grandpa, my papa. The one who raised me. He saved my life honestly, but like I said story for a different time. 

Things are different now between him and I. It makes my soul weep because he's honestly my hero. Maybe its the age setting in, either the case, it crushes me.

I feel like he is constantly thinking I am the one to blame. For everything. Its hard to explain, but in my heart I feel I can do nothing right in his eyes and it sucks because all I've ever really reached for in life is *validation*. Especially from a male parental figure.

Validation is both *unrealistic* and *unattainable* from anyone other then ones self I now realize, but I think it really all comes from my anxiety and this obsessive need I have to have everything a certain way. 

And I can't help it. 

Even my relationships in life. Like I want to be seen a certain way by others, not saying I *ever* veer from the authentic, but I obsess over the thought of it not being good enough for anyone, if that makes sense? Stuff happened to me as a kid that instilled all this. 

And it fucks with me until this day, its actually why I am writing right now probably.

ANOTHER story for a different time. If any of you want to ask about any of this, feel free.

And I know, I know, at what point does your child hood become your crutch, but I'll explain eventually.

By the way, if you are curious I do take medication. I am a legal medical marijuana patient and that helps immensely with my idiosyncratic brain. Hahaha. 

And no it doesn't affect my being a parent. So miss me with that in the comments. In fact it gives me the strength to overcome my mental health stump and my chronic pain so I can be the mom I need to be for my wonderful angel boy.

But back to the validation.. I don't feel like I have ever really received it, from my own self or anyone else. 

I wanna say the invalidation from Papa and Ben are what hurts the most as I said my dad was never really that big into the picture.

.. I just try so hard to make Ben happy, I want him to be proud of me. I want him to think I'm *great*. I feel like everything I do is so minuscule and tiny in his eyes. I try so hard to make everything in life good and perfect for us and for our family and I put SO much effort and love into it and it goes completely unacknowledged or I'm told that I'm doing *too much* or maybe he thinks these are things that I *should just* be doing because he helps me financially..

..and in life in general he *really has* helped me remarkably. And for that I will forever be so grateful and overwhelmingly happy for.

But in my honest complete heart of hearts, I just really yearn for the love and the approval of my love, Ben.

And I tell you its not all bad, but I needed to vent today. I was basically just told all weekend I wasn't really shit and I really put my *all* into it and it broke my heart.

I hope you didn't mind the bitching or the whining.

Also, I have to throw in again, my sons birthday was amazing and I *never* let *any* of these emotions show through these events, he will always come first to me.  
*Always*.

Anyways there will be more to come, lol.

And I hope you all have beautiful endeavors,

My thoughts always,

Tania"
"I tried posting twice in r/CasualConversation but I guess that wasn't the right place so I posted here but the format was wrong in the title. Hopefully this one is finally right! Here goes attempt #4.

I just stumbled across my old reddit account. It's like looking at a time capsule of the person I used to be. Feels like so long ago and that everything has changed, yet things are still the same in some aspects.

Crazy what a difference a day makes, or in this case 2 years. If only we could travel back in time to give ourselves the perspective we have today.

Two years ago I was coming to the conclusion of my marriage, and today I look back with so much regret mixed with gratitude. I hate who I was so many years ago, but had things been even the slightest bit different, I wouldn't be a mother to the most amazing daughter in the universe, and I wouldn't have the wisdom, experience, or knowledge that I have today.

Anyway, that's my 2 cents. How is everyone doing? Happy Tuesday!"
"TL;DR at the end.

This week has been a bit stressful, yet fun. Getting through all the lectures, taking notes, planning when to do homework, go to tutoring, etc. was a daunting task, to say the least.  The math and chemistry classes I'm currently taking are challenging in that there is a lot of work involved, and a lot of studying is going to have to take place in my part. As for the Geology class, I was supposed to take, that's is another story entirely.
 
The Geology class, unbeknownst to me, was actually an honors course that was open to everyone. I, not knowing this beforehand, signed up to this class without a second thought. (Although I did find it a bit weird that the class was not completely filled when I signed up. Know I know why.)
 
The instructor for that course is a rude, grumpy old man that takes himself too seriously. During his first day, he explained, in a ""professional"" tone, that this Geology class was an honors course and that anyone that had not taken an honors course before should drop the class. (I say 'professional' because he talked in a serious, demeaning tone to his students.) 
 
Now, I being the only student there that had not taken an honors course decided that the best thing to do was to get up, sort of interrupting him, and asked him if I was in the right class. He, in his snarky tone, decided that the best response for me was to simply answer with these two words, ""Get out."" Now, this naturally ticked me off big time. How in the hell are you going to tell a student, in front of the whole class, to get out in such a disgusting tone? I mean, seriously, he could have just have pulled me to the side and told me to leave his classroom and drop the course. Instead, he decides to pull this stunt because its, ""... it's an honor's class and it prepares you for the real world ... in a job, people are going to be like this ... blah blah."" Now, I understand that if you're going to be a doctor, this might be true, but for this instance, there was no reason for him to act that way. So, what did I did? I walked out of the classroom basically cussing him out in Spanish and went straight to my academic advisor to see, along with financial aid, to see what would happen if I drop the course.
 
Of course, in the end, I dropped it the course. I did not report the instructor's behavior towards me, even though I was tempted to do so. Luckily, I was talked out of it by a certain someone that I trust completely. 
 
All in all, this whole week has been a wild ride. I got a bunch of stuff to do, so I'll end with this. Even though during our lives, we will encounter many problems and difficulties, we will always find help if we know where to look. If you ask the right people, they will guide you to make the right choices in life, and as a result, you will grow and mature to be the person you were meant to be.

TL:;DR: It has been a long, yet interesting week. I get kicked out of an honors class, which was open to everyone by the way, due to not taking an honors class beforehand. Basically, most of the rant is of that one experience.

Edit: Structure

"well last night was one for the books. My father who is a paranoid schizophrenic as I mentioned in my last diary post was back at it again tonight. I knew there was some unfinished business because of the way it ended on sunday night. In the past I would have probably avoided even going back over to my parents house but I do not own a washing machine and dryer and I desperately needed to do laundry so I went back over for dinner yesterday. I have found that meeting challenges head on is the only way to do it. Do my best to find a good resolution in a positive and productive manner and move on to new challenges. So after being home for not too long my father started doing weird things like shaking his head and all sorts of weird gestures that he thought I was doing directed at him. This always makes for a very stressful situation. I also found out that on Sunday night he thought that I thrust my pelvic/dick in his face. Neither of these could be farther from the true and basically he is seeing things that are not actually there. A scary proposition. In the end it is truly his upbringing and lack of confidence that has led him to where he is now. I am not so certain that he even knows what love is. and that is ok and I accept him and love him for who he is. despite anyones faults, there is always something special about any individual in the whole world. Something that they can contribute to society as a whole. 

So anyway, last night we sat down for dinner, and is often the case during dinner time things exploded. lots of yelling crying etc. Not sure why this always been the time when shit hits the fan but without fail again it happened tonight. I feel that this is why my anxiety often manifests itself in my gut. My fight or flight adrenaline kicks in and next thing i know there is no blood in my stomach to digest. My new meditation techniques instantly helps bring me back down to a more grounded state where I can properly digest food and feel good. This same situation had happened a couple months ago and since then he was doing much better. He really needs to see a therapist and work through his problems. He has so many pent up issue he has not dealt with in a positive way and they come out in weird negative spurts. None the less, yesterday was productive and we reached a good resolution where if he sees me doing anything out of the ordinary that he simply just asks me about it instead of getting upset about it. We have a good positive talk about it and move on. Last night took alot out of me but again, i am learning new valuable tools that I will have with me the rest of my life and I could not be happier about that. 

Living a healthy, productive, fun life is at my finger tips and everyday I am grasping it more and more...getting older is amazing! "
" 

This Monday is the first day of Spring 2019 semester. I'm excited to start this semester and I already have gotten most of the stuff that I need ready. There are a few things that need to be addressed, like getting my car back from the mechanic tomorrow and getting a simple scientific calculator for chemistry class. (I can't use my TI-84 for this class for reasons I assume will be explained in the first day of class. The calculator should not cost more than $10 in my opinion, and for the mechanic, I'm not exactly sure how much that's going to cost. I still don't know how much he will charge for all the work and the fact that it's been in their property for a week, but it shouldn't be much considering we already have used his services before and he seems to be an honest man.)

Anyway, I'm sort of burned out from reading the class syllabus for both classes, the third class hasn't posted anything online regarding a syllabus, so I'll just end with this:

I hope my professors understand that we, as a mostly young society, are still growing and maturing as we begin our classes at this University. Most of us have not had much responsibility over the years, well not in my case anyway, and we are going to need their guidance and wisdom in order to succeed this Spring semester. "
"I'm having fun.  Smooth days are not much interesting to describe, but how bad can a Sunday be?

Even an unstable man can have his days.  I've been liking this experience.  Maybe I should write more.  I reviewed my old posts, and I had blogs, but they are too easy to delete, and I am too unstable to keep a diary that can be easily wiped.

I finished reading *12 Rules For Life,* of Jordan B. Peterson.  It's a good book.  Today I might start Dante's Inferno. 

Not much to say today.  Whatever I could pull now would sound forced."
"Wow. so today was a day. My school was closed due to a pipe bursting, so I woke up in a rather good mood... until I remembered I had to go to work at 3:45. I sadly begin to get ready for work after sleeping in, leaving me not much time for anything else. I go to work and get the busiest section (i work in a restaurant as a waitress). So, all night in rushing around, scrambling to get orders and keep all the guests happy. It all worked out in the end but mistakes were made and some tears were almost shed. Amidst the chaos, I took moments to stare at my very attractive male co-worker. God, this guy is HOT and over the course of the past few weeks, I've developed a pretty serious crush on this guy. Unfortunately, it was towards the end of this shift that my good friend who works with me pulls me into the empty side station to gossip a bit, as we do, about this guy and how he is struggling between two girls because he doesn't know who he should date, but he has a massive crush on both of them. Spoiler alert, i am NOT one of them. So i pretend to be into the conversation while I was like dying inside. I went back to work but all of the guests had left at this point so i didnt have much to do to take my mind off of it so I was clearing my tables while having nothing to do but think about the fact that i dont have a chance with him and be sad. I talk to said hot coworker for a bit which made me v happy and then i went home. I'm home now eating mediocre microwave pizza and procrastinating homework due tomorrow. Today was a day"
"I can't even finish any books I bought for months, because whenever I'm about to start reading, It'll be a fucking thing that bother me and I have to leave it as fast as possible. Work, Laundry, Cooking, My grandma's walking problems, Studying, Planning for future internship, and especially Real-World socializing which I suck at most.

I hate keep smiling and be socially active every time, but thanks to my headphones that create a little space, even my family doesn't like me wearing it and keep telling me to take it off, although it's my private time.

&#x200B;

Tomorrow and days later, I have to work part-time in the market, that needs to talk with people all the time.

and Monday is the day the college term is starting, that needs to talk with people all the time.

After that, I wouldn't have time to read the books I bought for months and left them to be dusty. Again.

I just want to leave in the imagined world that I can control anything."
I'm alone all the day...I need money bcz without it I cant do anything...but I hate boring job...1.i need find a new one but idk where to start its scares me [2.im](https://2.im) trying forget my problems but all I can do sit on internet [3.my](https://3.my) eyes so tired all day look at the monitor 4.idk wht to do now 5.u tell me
"This last month I struggled a lot. I couldn't find a place to live for college, and raising my educational credit was denied. After this, my father phoned us and told us my paternal grandmother has uterine cancer, and that they'd be doing a total hysterectomy(removal of ovaries and uterus). My car needed repairs I couldnt afford. Though nothing could change that, I am optimistic that she will be fine; I finally have an apartment and have figured out my loans, and my step dad did everything to affordable fix my car. . I am happy. There is bad stuff in my life, there always will be, but just because theres bad stuff, it doesn't mean you dont get to be happy. Make your own weather, make your own joy. Of course I left out a lot, but remebering everthing while writing is hard. Feel free to pry. More stories of my live are coming."
"Title probably probably sounds shallow af, and I was thinking of putting this on a confessions sub, didn't really fit the tone on either of the big ones, and it got removed from CasConv. 

Long post warning. 


So, about two months ago I came out as bi, a few friends knew before, and a few more had their suspicions, but this was telling my parents (who in turn told my paternal grandparents which is fine) , siblings (two are older, with kids of their own, so via text), followed by a Facebook post.

I knew most of my family would be fine with it, from when my (maternal) cousin came out as gay. I then also knew that, unsurprisingly, my maternal grandparents are homophobic, as they all but disowned him. 

""Unsurprisingly?"", you say? Well, they're just in general old-fashioned (and senile a bit) , and not necessarily in the best way. They're also racist/anti-immigrant, which has definitely caused friction, seeing as my dad is an immigrant himself, which when my mother brought to my grandmother's attention, was met with ""oh, not him, the Eastern European sort""

Just typing that quote makes my blood boil, as it did my mother's at the time, which led to strong words and my grandmother promising never to come to our house again and storming out, while my grandfather very quietly finished his breakfast, leaving shortly after.

That promise has been kept, partially due to my grandfather getting less keen on driving.

Since I came out, we have been up to visit them once, and luckily nothing happened, no mention of any such matters. 

Here's where things get interesting, since my grandfather's recent hospitalisation (moderately serious, but looks like he'll be fine in the long run), the aforementioned gay cousin has been to visited them (by hisself), which, I assume by my mother terming it the silver lining of the situation, went well/uneventful in applicable matters. 

Now, obviously I'm not going to bring it up while my grandfather's in hospital, we're headed there (3hr drive) now, but maybe at a later date. But, I don't want to risk losing any money from them (current £20/month pocket money, £40 at birthday, and eventual wills).

Idk the point of this post, probably just venting.

"Feeling very down and fuck everything last couple days. From getting clocked by that idiot who thought it was ok to be like, ""Hey, you're transgender! It's so immediately obvious to anyone who looks at you!"" to getting called ""she"" multiple times at the post office yesterday, I don't want to leave the house. I can't even stand listening to a podcast for more than ten minutes. Got my reading tonight so I forced myself to clean but it's slow going. My friend is coming over and we're going to go for a walk. It's actually really nice out and despite the heavy coating of fuck everything I do always appreciate a beautiful day. "
"Been having a truly disconcerting amount of brain fog lately. 

Example: went to buy coffee. The lady says, ""It's $1.79."" I hand her a dollar. She waits. I wait. We both stand there for a minute until she says, ""You gave me only one dollar, it's $1.79"" and I realized I had to give her another dollar. I jokingly said ""Wow, I really need that coffee,"" but honestly I did. Even after the coffee I still don't feel entirely *there*. Later on a call with my coworker I had to concentrate really hard to follow even my own train of thought. Probably not getting enough sleep.  

Had a good workout. Did all the pull-ups and dips, and a trainer who works at the gym came by and gave me a useful tip about the pull-ups. (When you get stuck halfway up, take a deep breath and then exhale hard. It gives you a boost.) I had wanted to get on the pull-up/dip machine as soon as I saw it open because there's a girl who comes in the mornings and does her entire workout on that machine, so I did all my lifting first and then only ran a mile after. Going to take the dog for another mile later. I used the giant-dumbbell barbells for squats today instead of the Smith machine. It only goes up to 60 pounds but I feel better holding the 60lb barbell up to my chest like a horizontal goblet and knocking out some good, full-range, ass-to-grass squats than I do struggling through heavier weight with the Smith machine. 

Some kind of indoor allergies (dog hair?) are getting to me. Keep waking up with my throat feeling weird and dry and not being able to breathe through my nose. Might get an air purifier.  

Finished an art project I've been working on for a couple months and as always not entirely happy with the results, but it's done and it's out there and some of my friends have said kind things about it. Need to work on these stories next. My goal is to get a thousand-word draft of each of the nine stories done before my birthday, but then I'll go back and pick one and really tackle it and expand it and polish it and see about getting it printed somewhere. It's so easy to just put stuff online now because there's no gatekeepers, but then who's going to look at it? It's harder and scarier to try and make it good enough to get accepted by someone else, but I want to try. "
"I missed a day yesterday.  We had plans to celebrate a friend's birthday by the lake, and I never made time to come here. There I go again, neglecting the habits I want to form for my well being.  I try to reframe that self-flagellation as honoring my feelings in the moment.  The truth is I just didn't feel like it.

My husband was extra on top of getting our stuff together to go to the lake.  He basically took care of everything while I slowly got ready. I appreciate how capable he is and how he will take charge like this.  I am lucky to have him. I didn't want to go to the party.  I am resistant to outings with friends.  I don't know why I am so anxious about being around people.

My anxiety was in full effect when I turned down a friend's invitation to a happy hour this weekend because I felt anxious about the setting and being around new people.  I had a check list in my brain of all that could go wrong.  After discussing with my husband whether I was letting my anxiety steer in this situation, I decided to change my mind and made the plans.  I am grateful to have such an understanding friend who gets it when my brain tries to talk to me out of doing fun things.

We got to the lake and immediately started drinking.  After one drink, my anxiety was gone and I had a great time playing frisbee and talking with old friends and new.  I feel afraid people will judge me for my life choices, but they didn't even come up, as usual.  I am adept at keeping people talking about themselves.  I would much rather talk about someone other than myself. It felt good to have people want to talk to me. It felt good to be around a group of people just enjoying each other's company and the bright, sunny day.  


Today I feel a touch hungover but I worked out anyway.  I feel kind of 'glowy', meaning I feel content.  The combination of the socializing, sunshine, and exercise was good for me.  I'll try to remember for next time my brain thinks these outings are a bad idea.  My friend told me I am one of his favorite people on this planet, and I appreciate it immensely.  He sure doesn't act like it sometimes, but I'll take it anyway.  I think he says that because he is quite the narcissist.  He hates talking about or listening to anything that isn't about himself.  I'm fine with that generally.  Sometimes, it would be nice to have him ask and wonder about my well being and my life.  I am most certainly hoping too much from that relationship.  He hasn't done it in 10 years so he probably won't start now.  I do care about him and always will, despite his flaws. I worry about how much he drinks and does drugs.  I worry about any illegal dealings he is involved in.  He has a sad soul. I am convinced he would kill himself if he were facing a long prison sentence. I wish I could help him be happier, but alas, that is not my job.  I feel his pain when I'm around him, even though he is laughing and joking.  I wish I could fix his life for him. 


My husband did not appear to get jealous at all even when I was talking with new guys in the group.  I realize looking back I even touched a guy's hair in the context of a conversation about his hair color.  I probably shouldn't have done that.  I was not trying to flirt, but I wonder if it could have come across that way.  There is not a jealous bone in my husband's body and I am amazed by it.  I, on the other hand, would have probably been in tears had I witnessed him touching another woman's hair.  Ugh. I have jealousy issues.  I just have issues period.


Overall, it was a lovely day.  Today, I am enjoying feeling content.  I'll probably cook something delicious and lay low tonight... for tomorrow I tackle happy hour with new people!  Yikes.


Today I am grateful for:
1) Having lovely conversations with new people

2) Feeling loved by an old friend

3) My husband's ability to get stuff done without me asking/directing

4) Playing in the sunshine in the middle of the week

5) The puppy party at the lake"
"Here I am after getting upset over nothing. I feel I'm taking out my general unhappiness on my partner. The reality is I am upset with myself, not him. I am trying to keep some form of scheduled self-care going and here lately I've been failing. This has resulted in crying outbursts and feeling low. Really low.

My dog died at the end of December. I know everyone knows how bad that sucks, but I was not prepared for how completely gut-wrenching this experience has been. I feel guilty because I try to keep thoughts of him out of my mind so I don't break down in tears. Like I'm betraying his memory because it wrecks me to think about him. It has been 3 months and I still can not bear to look at pictures of him. He was everything to me. He brightened my days and made me feel deeply loved. I didn't care that he also made everyone else feel loved. He had enough to go around. Life is not the same without him. Life will never be the same.

I should be grateful. I want to be grateful. I want to feel ease. I want to relax and not worry so much. I want to just let go of the preconceived notions and perfectionism riddling my thoughts. I want to let go of the shoulds and just live freely. I don't know why this is so hard for me. My husband makes it seem so easy.

Here I am about to make another commitment to myself. I don't want to avoid myself anymore. By writing this publicly, I hope I feel a little bit more accountability than my usual forays into journaling. I will do my best to journal a little every day.

Things I am grateful for today: 

-dark chocolate 

-the coming storm 

-being able to see and feel 

-wanting to be better"
"This is my first entry here, my style of journal is memories. I've been thinking a lot lately about past relationships so I thought I'd start from the beginning.

When I was a child, the first boy I can remember 'kissing' was in the first grade. We both had white blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. We would play Power Rangers on the playground, and I was the only girl he didn't think had cooties.

I can remember very little from that far back but I do recall going to his house once. I don't remember anything we did there, other than make bugs in a boys version of an Easy-Bake-Oven. The name of the machine isn't coming to me, but it had a mad scientist on the box. Something about slime or ooze.

The elementary school we went to closed after first grade and we went to different schools. I never saw him again, and I didn't really think about him until these memories came. This guys last name I remember, but haven't been able to find him on social media. If I did, I wouldn't reach out. I'm curious what he looks like now, as all I see when I imagine him is the white blonde children of the corn kids. I have a feeling hypnotherapy would bring back more memories of 'CC', not that they would be good or bad, again it was the first grade."
"Edit Accidentally titled the date wrong! It's 3/4/18! 😭

I think I need to spend some time in /r/hownottogiveafuck because I worry way too much of what people think. Sometimes I wish I could get these thoughts off my mind but sometimes it just races with the negative thoughts about what others may or may not think of me. So much wasted time thinking about this. 

I remember someone saying, ""What someone else thinks of you is none of your business."" So I tell myself in my head ""It's none of my business."" Pretty often it works and I can move on, but sometimes I let myself get bogged down in thoughts. 

What can I do to be positive? Journal, and think of things to be grateful, exercise, and eat healthy. Right now those are things I can control and do. 

**Gratitide:** Today I am thankful for coffee, hot chocolate, and the peace of being in my own home.

**Earnest Hope For Others:**Today my thoughts are with those who are suffering from anxiety issues. I know my racing thoughts are nothing compared to someone who has extreme anxiety disorders and panic attacks. I hope they find calm, peace and understanding.

"I don’t know why I’m doing this, but at the same time I know… first of all I had to practice my English, so, maybe you are reading this and thinking “omg a 6 years old kid writes better than she”. It’s right.

I want to share with you my tears of my week, joy tears, sad tears and how my life is.

I’m going to star with the end… The end of the past year I loosed one of the most important persons in my life; my grandpa. I tell you this because is important for me that you knows about it. Lately is the main reason of my sad tears.

I wasn’t an emotional girl until this moment.. OMFG, everything makes me cry! But I’m not crying everywhere, I just do it when I’m alone.

Before I forgot… if you want to correct my English, please do it! I’ll be pleasure to read you.

Leaving behind the past year success, another big deal happens to me at the beginning of this year, but now it was something nice.

I’m no that kind of person who takes decisions easily and I was working for a company that doesn’t pay me on time and I wasn’t enjoy my work so much…

The real adventure starts when I fall from my comfort zone and I get a new job. It was not easy but here I am, writing in English for trying to don’t lose my job (also I’m trying hard about not using google translate).

I live in Mexico and I’m working for a company from the United States.

I’m going to share with you fragments of my life. Advices are welcome too.

Week 1 — What am I doing?

That was the question on my head for the full week! I was exited but also scared because I take a job with not a lot of experience but I’m always full of excitement to learn new things and improve my skills.

At the beginning I was surprised about how fast they talk English and sometimes I was lost in the conversation. More because I’m the most distracted person in the entire office. Now, maybe I’m feeling that all this are nerves…

... I did a blog and I’ll try to put everything there and also here, at least 1 per week... 

[MEDIUM](https://medium.com/@YunForeign/i-dont-know-why-i-m-doing-this-but-at-the-same-time-i-know-first-of-all-i-had-to-practice-my-23fd65b0764f?source=linkShare-5661a5e5f475-1517039858)"
"During the night, I am best able to collect my thoughts. In the quiet after my children have gone to bed I'm left with some glorious time to think and plan. It is time I have claimed for myself so I am thankful for it.

Tonight I'm pretty tired, exhausted really, but it is a good kind of exhaustion, it comes with the feeling of knowing I had a productive day. I feel satisfied and useful. I also have a soreness, the kind relieved by a good long stretch. 

I do feel a bit anxious as I have a few things for school to work on, a paper that feels as if it will never be done and lots of reading for class. After this entry I plan on getting started. I'm so eager for it to be finished.

"Dear Diary,

I have a wonderful husband and extended family, a resort style condo in a green and quiet suburb outside of Los Angeles, two adorable kitties who shower me with love and attention, enough money to afford delicious and nutritious foods, and enough time to do the things I love in life. Unfortunately, I don't find any pleasure in anything anymore. It's embarrassing to admit, especially because I have this fortunate life; I am not happy and I haven't been for a long time. I used to love meeting new people, arts and crafts, spontaneous trips, and trying new restaurants. For years now, I just feel lazy to do any of it and feel anxious meeting new people. I figured it was a dulling caused by alcohol abuse and too many hangovers/blackouts. So I stopped drinking in excess and cut it down to once a week, but I still feel numb. Christmas is usually my favorite time of year and makes me feel nostalgic and magical. This year it came and went and I just felt BLAH! 

I decided it is finally time to try medication.  Two nights ago I started a prescription of 10mg a day Lexapro. I've never taken any meds for anxiety or depression so I'm feeling nervous and excited at the same time. It is easy to find threads of people commiserating about their depression and horrible side effects, it's not so easy to find the success stories. I hope that I will be one of the lucky ones who feels better, and be able to document for others who are looking for a positive thread about recovery. 

So far, my only negative side effect is that I've woken up at 4:00 AM both mornings and it was hard to fall back asleep. I woke up with a much more positive demeanor than I usually do (I am NOT a morning person). I also think that writing this post is something I've said I wanted to do for a long time but never got around to it. It's probably too soon for the drug to have this kind of effect, but the placebo (and fact that I told my family and doctor) feels like I'm taking control of the situation. 

Until next time...

"Not really sure how to say everything that's running through my mind right now but I feel like if I hold it in .. it'll bug me.. but I don't necessarily have anyone IRL who'd understand.. I mean.. I tried talking to my mom but i don't think she understood... and my best friend has just experienced a huge loss of her own, so for me to bring my trivial in comparison turmoil and demand attention just seems incredibly ... selfish... 

So i guess I'm sorry .. you lot have been incredibly supportive and helpful in the past... that I'm just reaching out... just the fact that someone can ""hear"" me out I guess.. is already a big deal... Lol that's an incredibly long intro right? I'm sorry :( i guess on to the ""meaty"" part .. 

I'm not a physically clingy person... but i do get emotionally attached ... fairly quickly .. I've always just attributed it to being a Scorpio.. but maybe it has more to do with being the youngest of 3.. growing up in a loving household where the value of sibling relationships have always held a certain weight in our upbringing.. it hurts when it suddenly all changes.. My brother is 8 years older than I am ... he left home when I was only 10 to go to university in another country but there were always emails.. text messages... phone calls and Skype calls that kept is connected every day.. the older I got, the closer our relationship grew... My sister and I were inseparable... I was 5 years younger... she thought I was her doll .. and sure we had our spats growing up... kicking .. screaming .. pulling each other's hair .. but we were best friends .. and we did everything together .. in the 18 years that we were under the same roof.. we hadn't spent more than 3 nights away from each other .. but see all that has changed .. My sister got married in 2008 .. left home and moved to another country ... My brother has also been married .. for just a little over a year now .. and all i can say is nothing is the same anymore .. 

They've moved on... their lives seemingly now revolve around their spouses .. and in the case of my sister her 2 gorgeous sons whom I adore... but even when they visit it's almost as if I don't exist... just the kid (i'm 26) sister who is just.. there... 

There's no time for Goofing around or spending time with each other ... because they're always just .. attached to their spouses... I'm not unhappy that they have found their better halves .. I'm actually very proud and i like them both .. but I'm not afraid to admit that I guess im a little jealous .. that suddenly I'm unimportant... 

At the end of the day, the jokes have changed, the things we used to do, our ""same city"" traditions are now just memories... and at the end of the day... My involvement or anything of that kind in their conversations ... have become an afterthought inclusion to not hurt feelings ... atleast that's what it feels like .. 

I don't know if this all makes sense.. and frankly now that I've put it all out there .. it seems EVEN MORE trivial and pointless than before ... but these are my true feelings .. and i just ... idk .. needed a space to speak my mind .. if you've stuck through all of this .. thank you.. and I'm sorry ... this did get a little too rambley.. 

I'm on the way to the airport to drop my brother and sister in law off .. they were visiting for a week .. I cleared my entire schedule to spend time with them ... I spent exactly 4 hours with them ... and now I'm just trying to play it off like I'm unaffected.. 

Guess I should title this.. the 3rd child syndrome ..."
"It happened the way I hoped it wouldn't. My hopes were dashed faster than I could blink. 

And then the ache came. The ache of longing for something so bad returned just as I thought I had the chance to regain my grip.

I probably should have known better, because my life has a way of shitting on me when I want things. 

I wish it could change. I need this more than I need anything. 

Please."
"I take a deep breath, trying to let out some of the pain bottled up inside of me. But it doesn't work. The ache just sits on my chest like an elephant sitting there. 

The ache has come because of you. I'm afraid I'm going to lose you. I'm afraid that I won't get to be around you anymore, and my heart will break even further. I've been asking every single day for you to stick around. You have to. My heart can't take the loss of losing someone else, especially you."
"*Each night I lay close
  to you,
Fully clothed.
My hands ache to hold
  but there is a conduit where 
Your fingers fail to feel.
And so each night,
   I lay beside you fully clothed;
A shadow pantomime of need.
My body, it carries out a parody
  Of contentment.
While all the while I lay
   next to you,
Fully and struggle to feel...*

It's been a while since I've said anything to you. In a way, I guess I am selfish. I should be happy now, seeing someone who is better for me in so many ways that you couldn't be. 

So why? Why the incessant replaying of our downfall? Am I so masochistic that going back, revisiting this *grave*, when you have so easily laid me to rest, is my absinthe?

It's October now, the great gateway to a new place. Trees curl up to sleep and the sky above pulls away into a new stretch of possibility. 

And I wish, so *fucking* much, that I could be like the season. Born anew and shaking off sorrow like dead leaves. I could go anywhere, be someone new each day and forget all about​ you.

It seems unfair, that I could let myself be punished by your phantoms. You, who cast me and everything we knew together off like a mistake. In all the unfairness of it, I still find solace. My heart still lives under the cage of my ribs. Beating, so steadily I can believe it exists.

The sound of it is amplified.

"She started crying after she told me about something is wrong at home and she's worried about money, as usual. There's always something wrong there. She never has good news anymore and is always trying to drag me back to help. She doesn't realize she's doing it, I don't think. I just wish she'd realize how manipulative her sister-in-law is and that her real family needs her. She makes life so hard on herself, and me too because of it. 
  I wish it wasn't painful to talk to my mom. I miss her and I hate growing up. I can never spend time with her anymore. She's always tired, always busy, always full of reasons to keep herself in the hole she's dug.
 I guess she doesn't realize that I'm struggling, too. I'm not sure how I can make ends meet when classes start again and my hours at work are cut. No financial aid this semester, either. I just wish I had a better day off today. "
"It's a bit past 1:00am in the morning, and the tears are dripping from my eyes for so many reasons. Ones I hadn't anticipated, and others I knew full well would make my heart hurt.

It's hard to understand why this world is so cruel sometimes, and why it throws the shit it does at you. Are some people just meant to be happy all their lives and not have to deal with the intense pain that lies within someone like me? And are other people just destined to have shit lives even if they've tried everything they can to change it?

There's too many questions to answer and not enough tears in my body right now to try to figure them out. "
"Outside my window tree boughs are in motion, overcast the sky. A storm is imminent, and if asked, for this I would choose these southern summers after all. I do not know the reason, but I have felt, for as far back as I can remember, the most content before a storm, in the lashing of the tepid wind. To go outside and close my eyes, and to then be so nearly carried on the wind, I have not known anything like it—I am [air](https://68.media.tumblr.com/c8d7df30e6befa902186ec4495bf2fa9/tumblr_nvrdrgqrcC1t3ctxmo1_500.gif). Life cannot burden me."
"Hearing from you this week was entirely unexpected, but it couldn't have come at a better time.

It was exactly what I needed, and I keep asking myself if it really did happen. And it sure did.

It gives me a little hope that this could maybe turn into what I want it to. It's taken so long for it to come to this, but I'm used to waiting at this point.

I've felt your energy inside of me all week, in a one that's been extremely stressful for me. The feeling of knowing that you do actually care is one that is going to last for awhile."
"Today wasn't extraordinary by any means. I got some good work done, work that I can be proud of.

Nose has been stuffy. This is how it often goes when I start exercising again. I really wish I could rid of it.

I'm winding down earlier this evening. Nothing bad happened today but nothing earth shaking either. It kind of feels like I'm only using my finger to tap the surface of a pond. The ripples go out for others to enjoy but all I got was a tiny tap with the tip of my finger.

I want to feel the ocean, it's raw power and its majesty. I want the waves to soak me and make me come alive. I want it to permeate every bit of me. I want to feel life in its unadulterated glory."
"I'd felt for awhile that it was fate that prevented me from getting that job. As much as I wanted it at the time, I didn't want to leave where I already was. The first time I knew it was the right was that night seven months ago in Madison when we fell off the chairs laughing at work.

There were other times in between I felt it too, but last night just solidified it for me. I knew I was exactly where I was meant to be, even though I wasn't emotionally ready, (and still am not) for this season to be over. Fate put me in this position, and I'm extremely grateful for that.

See you in October."
"I came here to unload. But here I sit, yet again to spill the truth. 

I feel like I have lived a lifetime in the last few days. So much has happened, things have evolved so quickly, over and over. 

Bill moved out, in the process it got violent, in our no fault state he was still the only one that went to jail. He blames me of course. I own my part, he still doesn't own his. 

We are headed for divorce, I am high in fear, and tipsy in anger. Currently hurt is not a factor.I feel some excitement at the prospect of life on the other side of this. 

Bill spent that last 24 hours telling me how much he hates me, that I am a shitty person and a shittier wife. While all those things hurt I know they aren't true and I know they are said out of anger, hurt, and fear. It's ok. Yell away Bill. I know it hurts me, I know why, I can handle it. 

Shandi was at practice tonight, both of them. She makes me snap out of what ever is ugly and light shines. I don't know why. She is just radiant in her fucked upness. And she loves me, I feel the love. She isn't using me, she takes a turn listening to me, she is there for me the second I need something over flowing with what ever she has to give. It is so... refreshing. 

Mike attends the last practice. He is unavoidable, our kids are the same age. 

We haven't talked since our last encounter. I don't know the rules, I suppose there are none at this point. Why should there be? I am still married and he should be careful. I am happy now, but I know  I am messed up. I am working so hard to come out on the other side of this, I fear failure again.

I am in a good spot right now though. I don't know why I am so at peace with everything. Lots and lots of prayer I guess, I feel like I am praying all the time. All of the sudden, it just feels like God has got this, I can't get through this with out believing that. 

I don't even care how this all ends at this point, I just want to come out of this healthy and happy. Two things I have never been.  

Bill, just at this moment wounded me. I just have to shake my head. I know why he is doing it. His ""love"" is so conditional. Only when I am cooperating and conforming is he happy with me. 

Anger is flowing in me now. This is so stupid, I have spent so much time this weekend trying to not sling shit at him or about him. I have been kind, patient, understanding. Why? I don't know, I don't want to come out of this hating him. I don't want him hating me. I want to not feel anxiety when I see him for child exchange. I don't want our kids to feel the tension between us and feel uncomfortable.

This is beyond repair after this weekend, so much damage was done. It was beyond repair before, but now... it is dead. I spoke with an attorney for a pfa and divorce today. I am doing everything I can to close this book and not revisit this place of manipulation and fear ever again.

It is so hard. Everything in me screams STOP!!! Why are you doing this?! But I KNOW this is bad for me. I KNOW I am busted to pieces constantly with him. I KNOW there is better that this even if it's being alone forever. 

I have to do this for me. I have to do this for my kids. I have to do this for my life. I said it before, but I am praying so hard, for God to have his way in this. I know what I want, I don't know if it's what is best. I am trying so hard to let go and let God. I am desperate to hand this off to Him and be free of the worry. 

I want Mike. I am too ashamed to ask for him. But that is what I want. I want to experience him. All. The. Way. I want to know what it's like to fall asleep next to him and to wake up next to him. To cook next to him. To parent next to him. To be in his arms whenever I want to be. To know that I am his and he is mine. To stand next to him and know that HE. IS. PROUD. to be seen with me.

He always was. 

But I don't know if it is what is best. I don't know if that is where my life is supposed to go. I haven't asked for it, because I want to know what is SUPPOSED to happen. Nothing in my life that was SUPPOSED to happen has happened. (we can go down all sorts of debates on this as the end of this story has not yet been written into existence) I can't believe that a Holy Father, if you will, would want His child to have lived in so much pain and fear for so long.

Things are changing... "
"It's Easter, but that's just another holiday I don't celebrate. So, today's just been another one of those patented ""groundhog day"" days for me. 

There's so little satisfaction for me in life right now. The things that I need to feel fulfilled are so close, but seem so out of reach no matter what I do for them. And that brings up questions within my own mind of why I'm apparently not good enough to have them. I sit here and wonder, why other people get to have what they want and have it come so easy, and what I want is always some pipe dream. 

I'm tired of it. I'm tired of just ""living"". Going through the motions every day seems so fruitless. And all I can do is just sigh."
"The wife and I went to a cousin's wedding last night. The bride's brother propositioned my wife there, in front of me, her husband, at the wedding dinner, as part of his toast. 

During my toast, I debated responding to the disgusting proposal. I concluded that it was better to keep the focus on the bride and groom. 

After the speeches and dinner, I pulled the chap aside, informed him that he lady he'd propositioned **was married, to me** and 
a fair amount older than him -- I think he's 26, we're both 37. 

Ever the optimist, he responded, *yeah, but she's hot and smart*. 

To which I replied, *Aye, that's why she's mine*. 

Finally, he said, to my wife, someone he'd never met before, *When you want someone better than /u/cruyff8, here's my number* and handed her his business card. 

Talk about stealing the spotlight away from the wedding couple."
"It’s kinda ironic how once you reveal any vulnerability to someone, family friend or lover, how quickly they throw it back in your face. I won’t let that stop me from being myself, however, I will be more cautious to whom I reveal that side to. Life is not a fairy tale, I’d be a fool to think I’ll always be received how I need to be. It is indeed a wake up call.

How people treat you at your lowest points are essential in revealing their character, real or fake? It’s also an eye opener to what you choose to accept from people. I’ve always over extended myself for others, spiritually, emotionally, financially….life can be very funny, ironic even. I always give with sincerity and without a second though. The universe is teaching me not everyone loves like me and that’s fine. That I need to recognize the genuineness in another and not assume they roll the same. You know the saying: “Assuming makes an ass out of YOU and ME.”

Giving myself one more month in this new state. Appreciate those who have helped me along the way, which has been very few. I thought this was a better decision for my mental health, my heart, and my soul, I am still hoping for the best. My patience is running thin. My pockets are empty. I’m struggling for basics and I am beyond frustrated. I’ve been proof reading, writing, and editing to make ends meet. This cannot be all life has to offer.

I refuse to feel like a burden again, honestly, to anyone. It seems no matter how hard I try or how much I let go….I am unable to get ahead in life. I’m 26 years old with not much to show for it, in August I will be 27. That’s three years before 30 and I am panicking. Clearly, I’m doing something wrong here. Clearly there is a lesson I’m not learning. Clearly I’m repeating the same pattern. In my younger years if you told me this is where I would be I’d laugh at you. No way!

It’s no one’s fault but my own. I hope to continue to learn and grow on this journey called life. One day I believe I will be successful….until then, baby steps. In the words of the Little Engine That Could; “I think I can, I think I can, I think I can.”

"I've never been much for Christmas celebrations over the years, and
I stopped believing in Santa long ago. There's nothing material I want, but I do have a wish. 

I wish that for 2017, we are able to spend some time together and become good friends. I've thought about you all year, and how badly all I've wanted was just for you to let me into your life and be your friend. 

So if there is someone out there that can grant me a wish, that would be everything I ask on my grown up Christmas list."
"I've been thinking about you all night. The warm weather here today gave me the warm feeling that you always give me when I see you. I'm going to Phoenix this weekend, and I'm certain I'll be thinking about you there too. And wishing you were there next to me, to bask in the sunlight together. My heart longs for you to return it's call, my love."
"I keep having these wants that are going unsatisfied. No matter what I do, I can never seem to get the results I want. And I'm tired of it being that way. The worst part of these wants is that they are reliant on the actions of other people, and I can't make them want to do things for me or help me get what it is that I crave. What's it going to take?"
"I'm trying to move forward, at least doing my best.

I've got an interview with a recruiter tomorrow. It's going to go well, the guy seems nice. Really could use some work right now. Hopefully he can get me into the start of an interview that's going to land me some work.

I haven't found Miss mrrow. I keep telling myself I won't keep walking around in the day or night looking for her, but then I'm out there everyday. Sometimes I tell myself I'm walking or bike riding to just relax, but it's not true. Some part of me has eyes up wondering, hoping, at every corners turn that she'll be there, waiting. 

Suicide is not an option. It's been silly to even consider it again. Home is going OK. Seems everyone's relaxed a bit. 

I'm trying to find my way back to my long lost friend. Money is going to be necessary for the endeavor. Even just trying to sit around the coffee shop getting some work done, waiting for her. 

I can do this. I can find a job that fits in with my goals of living a life worth living. I can find my long lost friend. I can work up the courage to tell her how I feel. 

I can do this."
"It's funny how life works sometimes especially when it seems to come full circle.

About a month back there was an itch I needed to scratch so I messaged a friend who got me in touch with a couple people. I met up with them 2 weeks back and I learn that we went to the same school barely 3 years apart. These people in turn connected me with someone else who I met today. Turns out they are running the business I interned at 15 years ago.

And it doesn't stop there. Meeting this new friend today is opening up some potential business opportunities for me. On the way home after meeting this friend, I stopped at a local shopping centre to buy some food when I bumped into the friends I met 2 weeks back.

It's exciting. Things are moving for me. I don't feel ready but hey, who is ever ready for life?"
"Phew, about time. 

I think I owe myself a holiday. I'm happy school is over but i'm a little depressed that i wont see my friends for a while but i know they are there if i need them. On friday i will be getting surgery on both my feet so i can't do exercise but hopefully all will be swell by the time it has recovered.

I'll write again later."
"""Life is meant to be enjoyed not suffered"" - thats something my mum said to me on the weekend when i was talking to her about how i was feeling with myself. I have come off my anti depressants and anti psychotic medications and although relieved to be over the worst of it, i haven't been feeling too hopeful about my life. I am 27, live at home, have a low paying job, have credit card debts, am overweight and i am lonely a lot. To say i have had a rough time these past few years is an understatement but id rather not dwell on the past. 

Today i am hoping to put into place this diary to help me track my day to day musings/mood. Even if i get no replies it will help to feel like i have put my thoughts out there to be read and shared with people. I want to turn my life around and with this diary i am hoping to stabilise my emotions and focus on improving my life. 

I have a PT session with my trainer later and i cant wait for it. I always feel great after a good exercise session - not only from endorphins but feeling like i am taking responsibility for my own happiness. ""I enjoy my PT sessions"" i remind myself, it is something that adds to my life. 

What else do i enjoy in my life at the moment? Not a lot. I get a thrill from Game of Thrones every week, i used to enjoy video games but i feel like i have outgrown them now....  still need to figure out what i enjoy in life. I know the depressed mind isnt conducive to hopeful thinking and enjoyment but i know i am coming out of it and really all i am feeling is the absence of joy that i haven't filled my life with. Perhaps it is enough to focus on work and fitness at the moment, though that begs the question if it were enough would i question it? 

Thats enough word salad for now. "
"It's Friday, finally, this feels like it has been the longest week ever. 

Last time I left off with Cody, Bill knew, I admitted Mike. I established I am have been being a slut. So I have dealt with myself on that aspect. Obviously I am going to make the decision to stop doing things like that. 

Bill has turned into a monster over the last 24 hours. I heard Skank on the other end of the night last night while he screamed at me. Knowing he is doing her eased some of my own guilt. We are both disgusting human beings. 

I told him I was going to go ahead and get divorce papers together. He told me that I was going to have to get a lawyer because he was going to refuse to sign them. 

My savings has been drained with all this back and forth. I dropped one of my jobs because I wasn't getting it done so my income is less. I can't afford a lawyer and he knows it. So I told him I guess we would just stay married then. 

As I write this I am realizing that I can still file for divorce, have him served and if he doesn't contest, and he won't realize he is supposed to the divorce is automatically granted after 60 days. 

So I am going to just file the paper work anyway. He is trapping me on purpose, like he always has. I don't inted to lay down and take it anymore. 

It's Memorial Day weekend. I have a wedding to shoot on Sunday and I am sure I can expect to have a house full of kids the rest of the time. I don't mind them. All the kids. I just have things that need done that require me leaving the house. I can't leave a thousand unsupervised boys in my house. 

This means I am going to have to send kids home. I hate doing that. 

I have to teach a class on 10 minutes. I am technically still on the clock. I went through a second interview today for a pretty big deal promotion. I haven't heard if I made it through. I applied, aware, before hand that I don't meet the experience required. I got pushed through the 1st interview anyway. I guess we'll see what happens. 

I don't expect to get it. So if I do it will be a nice surprise. All the bills are paid today. Including my poor pitiful saving account I have 400 bucks left... Thats actually not terrible. I should have 2 more paychecks and 2 more weddings before I have another bill to pay. (deep breathe) It's going to be ok. 

I want to go to the bar tonight. I want to go bad. Just to be around adults, for fun. I can't though. Even if I could I know I shouldn't. I just want to. I have fun every time I go. 

I don't know. I feel... off today. I'm not hurting really, because of Bill, I am just worn down, and need some fun. 

Also I am super mega high. So I guess my feelings are likely deadened. I felt a lot of panic rising when that ugly exchange was going on between me and Bill. I had my 1st bowl at 6am, I smoked all day, right through my interview. And now I am having another before I teach this class. 

I love weed. You can get high as fuck and feel amazing for hours, and no one has a clue. Now I have to go teach that stupid class. 

More later. "
"My name is Dan and I'm from New Zealand. I don't know why I'm doing a diary. it seems stupid or idiotic. I think I'm just gonna right about anything cause I don't know what to write. I'm typing this up in notepad and I can't be bothered been grammatically perfect.

I have ADHD, though through the years people reckon I was misdiagnosed which really pisses me off since they don't even know what I've been through. but apart from that I'm a 2IC on a dairy farm living comfortably. My personal life is boring , I know. this must be boring already, lol. but I'm not going to care if people read this or not, usually I care bout peoples judgement, so much that I become shameful at any point I deem could be seen in a negative way.

I really want to dance with my Fiance at our wedding next year, but I can't because its shameful. I mean it feels like I'm just a stupid idiot who should be expected to do something different then the old traditional back up plan of dance with the wife. no, instead she is gonna dance with her father, I don't mind though. also guess who is gonna do the speech? That's right, she is. because I have no idea what to say, apart from thanking people, nothing.

I'm jealous of people who have no shame, I wish I could just do things and not care what people think but there is no way. I'm too strong willed. no matter what people say, I just can't ignore it.

Want to hear me sing? good luck not even my partner gets to hear that. I've got too many thoughts running through my head now. can't pin point one to think about so I'll leave it at that today."
"I didn't end up asleep until 5am and woke up at about noon. There were no dreams that I can remember, which for now is a plus because they've been nothing but terror lately. My goal for the day was to write that driver's test and renew the license I let expire. Well, in short I practiced once online and killed it, then went and waited forever at the test center and failed one section of the test. What really gets me is i answered the questions too conservatively, so i failed for being more safe than the law is.
 
&nbsp;

I heard the worker there speaking to someone ahead of me that they had to redo one section of the test as well but would need to come back another day cause they have to line up again and the place is closing too soon. I got unreasonably angry when she told me the same and stormed out with my papers, but not before making a snarky comment. When I started cursing over it to Dave who was waiting for me outside he had a point that for having not studied and never driven I did very well with being just one answer off the mark.
 
&nbsp;

That was when I found a minute to process my feelings. I was mad because I would need to repeat the whole admin process again, and that my answer of 0.0 alcohol over 0.05 should make me MORE right, not wrong. But, I wasn't mad at the lady or at the place. I didn't prepare myself.
 
&nbsp;

The root of my problem was that I am in such a hurry to start accomplishing tangible things. My overall progress was being pushed back by a day. When I realized and said that out loud I started to cry. Seems extreme but I have a lot to work on right now and I don't know what may be riding on it. Anyways, being sad and self-aware feels much more productive than being angry and irrational. I know i would not have had this epiphany a few months ago, I would have stayed mad a while longer until it faded on it's own, and maybe i'd accidentally have taken it out on someone I loved with a second snarky comment.
 
&nbsp;

Noticing that the books i have been reading are helping me, I decided I could salvage the day's quota for progress by walking to the book store for another couple titles. I ended up with a book about calming down, and another about rebuilding trust in relationships. To me, they seem to go together quite well. With more trust, one would feel at ease and the same probably works equally in the inverse. I got in, washed my hands immediately (a wink and a nod to the ghost in my heart) and got to reading.
 
&nbsp;

The book about calm living suggests that having a clean and tidy living space is essential to everyone's mood, but to varying degrees. Seeing that wasn't entirely news to me but I linked that tidbit with empathy, which i had been reading about earlier. I started to understand how my bed and couch covered in dog hair might make someone else feel. It's nothing beyond an eyesore to me, but I could see it causing the right person anxiety (a wink and a nod). It would never happen to me, but I can't say it's unreasonable, either. Not only did i think of how it could make someone anxious, I took the time to reflect on what that feels like specifically, and realized that i need to vacuum more often. It's a direct parallel to me telling my dad I dislike going to his place because it is smokey. That annoys him, and to me that's unreasonable. I can't change the rules to give myself a pass.
 
&nbsp;

TL;DR: Today, I am a more sentient and empathic person than I was yesterday - no doubt!"
"I feel like I'm not asking for much when it comes to guys. And yet I keep ending up meeting dudes with some absolutely crazy shit going on with their lives. Stalker exgirlfriends, drug issues, you name it. I just want an average guy. At this point a ""boring"" guy would be a much needed break from all the madness. Life is complicated enough as is. I don't think that's being unreasonable. "
"Dear Reddit Diary,

1.  This is kind of a later entry than usual but here I am!

2.  So, Saturday I didn't really do much.  I was catching up on sleep lately since I've been working a bit harder.  I want to be a better colleague and my KPI has definitely improved!  So I'm real happy about that!

3.  I actually have a lot of homework this week lol Since tomorrow is a public holiday, class will be Tuesday to Thursday instead of the usual Monday to Wednesday so the teacher said he'd give us more homework since we have an extra day.  Oh well.  I should probably get a start on that.  Like, yesterday.  Yea, that would be a good start.

4.  Oh, Monday is Chinese New Year by the way, Reddit Diary!  It's the year of the monkey!  My year!

5.  Today, Sunday, was actually quite a full day.  Went to a cousin's wedding, then to my aunt's house, then to the shops to buy some stuff and finally to my cousin's farewell party/gathering.  So basically there was a lot of food and people and food and people and cars and people.

6.  Oh, my aunt has purple cats!  (They're not exactly purple and it's a long story perhaps for another time lol)

7.  Talked with my cousins.  Caught up on what stuff has been happening in their lives.  All of us grew up quite close and everyone's like GROWING UP.  WHERE DID ALL THE TIME GO?!  WHY ARE WE GROWING UP SO FAST?!

8.  I've got awesome plans for tomorrow.  If I actually do them is yet to be known but, I have hope!  So I'll guess I'll just end here!

Goodnight, Reddit Diary!  Happy Chinese New Year!  :)"
"Dear Reddit Diary,

1.  I know the title doesn't make sense but it's the 24th today and this is my 24th entry and what are the odds that this will happen again?!  I just thought it was a real cool coincidence lol

2.  Ok, first off, I'm sorry, Reddit Diary.  I said I'd write about my trip but I got so caught up in stuff I forgot to!  I was mostly catching up on sleep.  But I did manage to read one the of the books on my ever growing list!  Not as much as I'd like but still, slow progress is still progress!

3.  I actually was gonna write yesterday but I got caught up on looking for this book I once saw like months ago but I don't remember the title or author.  I remembered a name but I knew it wasn't the same.  It was similar but different spelling and so I mostly spent my Saturday looking for a book I thought I had written down to look up later but found no evidence of said note!  I thought I may have deleted it or something so I was a mess looking for this ridiculous book.  Walking up and down the stairs, turning on every possible electrical device, browsing my (always deleted) search history, checking my (endless) notebooks in multiple bags.  I was even tempted to go to the city to the bookstore I went to to see if they still had it or if the shop knew the title!  All I had to go on was the cover and one character name.  So, I basically spent hours googling and image searching and what have you.  I could not believe I did not write down the title of this book!  I really regretted not buying it.  So, I took a shower, ate dinner (I was looking for this stupid book since brunch) and I decided to check my ebook library.  Lo and behold, that stupid book is there!  Needless to say, I was ecstatic and pissed off at the same time!

4.  Work is alright.  I hit all my target KPIs so I'm pretty happy about that.  I also had to go collect my company t-shirt with my name on it.  It looks alright.  Hopefully, I won't have to wear it in a public setting with or without my colleagues lol

5.  A friend of mine left to continue her studies on Friday and I am completely envious of her.  I would like to go too but because of my past, a lot of people are saying I shouldn't and just work till I retire.  I really am not a fan of this plan.  At all.  Plus I don't have the money to go even if I wanted to right now.  Probably in a couple of years.  Then we'll see.  Hopefully I can.

6.  I've been having like good/bad dreams lately.  Like, they're a dark comedy show.  They start off good then go bad then like good-ish then bad.  Like I had one of an old friend I haven't talked to for a while.  He explained why and we hung out and did what we used to do and then I woke up.  I don't think I should contact him though.  I'm sure he's moved on.  Just as I have.  Maybe not as much as I'd like to but I'm getting there.  Then there was a dream about going to an amusement park and my cats ended up missing 'cause we took them with us.  Another was I got to live a dream of mine.  That one really hurt the most.  You have a dream of your dream becoming reality and then you wake up.  It's like a slap in the face.  The universe telling you to get your head out of the clouds and back down to earth.  Maybe it's a sign I should give up on my dreams.  It's not like I have a whole lot of support on it.

7.  Ok, this ended up longer than I wanted it to be.  I've got work and school tomorrow.  I actually haven't done my homework lol I forgot!  Eh, I'll do it tomorrow.  I should probably get like a reminder book.  Like those they give in school.  I can't remember what they're called but you write down if you have homework or an assignment due.  I need me one of those.  Or maybe just a small diary/calendar.  I might buy one tomorrow in town.  Maybe.  Probably not lol

Goodnight, Reddit Diary.  Hopefully your week hasn't been as depressed sounding as mine and here's to a better week!"
"Hiya folks! It's New Year's Eve! Man, how exciting. To think, that a year ago our little community wasn't all that active. And look how it's grown! 

We should celebrate by discussing our favorite parts of the year!"
"Dear Diary,

Things are getting better. They are. Things are looking up. I had an idea regarding getting my ex and I on speaking terms again. Hopefully it'll lead to more eventually. But for now, no contact. In March, I'll ask him how his vacation was and perhaps we can fall in love again over the course of a few months. I'm really hoping time and separation are all we need. If not, I'm sure I'll eventually meet someone new. But for now, no contact.

Things have been crazy hectic around here. Yesterday, my school gave me a crap ton of supplies for my home. They gave me milk, toilet paper, shampoo, body wash, dish sap, laundry soap, floor cleaner and tissues. They just did that like, two months ago. I'm going to have to share with my friends.. 

One of my tutoring gigs decided to cancel. They said their daughter is too tired and has too much homework. I'm going to guess that they aren't lying, since we do have class late in the evening. 

I'm really hoping that next term, they'll give me my own time slot for English as an extracurricular class, instead of taking up the other English teachers' class time. I teach sixteen classes a week, grades one through three. It gets challenging because every teacher for each grade wants me to teach something different. It gets frustrating. Sixteen different lesson plans because I don't have my own class time really blows. :/

Anyway, I'm going to go eat lunch. I woke up with an upset tummy today. Hopefully food will help. I'm tired. 

Peace. Love. PBJs.
-Stranded"
"Dear Reddit Diary,

Ok so I'm just gonna write this in points 'cause I'm lazy to write so much lol So here goes!

1.  Watched Star Wars: The Force Awakens.  I loved it.  Didn't love the guy snoring in front of us though.

2.  Went to a wedding.  I don't really like going to weddings.

3.  I just found out Dad loves Penguins of Madagascar.  Mostly 'cause he loves King Julian.  And he laughs like a child.  And apparently he watches it every Saturday morning while eating breakfast.  lol I never knew.  That's so adorable.

4.  Started watching Top Gear again.  I miss Top Gear.

5. I have no idea what else to write about.

6.  Skyped with my sister.

7.  Got a haircut.  I am rocking the Willy Wonka.  lol jk I don't look like Willy Wonka.

So yea.  I guess this is all.  Goodnight, Reddit Diary."
"Dear Reddit Diary,

Oh, boy oh boy.


I stayed over time today until 6:30PM...During break, I sat with some second shift people and started chatting with some old ladies about life, ha.  


I told them my situation and this one old lady was like, ""You got all the money you make to yourself.  You don't have any kids!  You're preparing for a family life.""


I answer, ""Yup, hopefully I'll have a family some day and when I do, I'm not going to struggle the way I am just getting by on my own right now.""


I sometimes chat on the phone with an elder friend from second shift about what's happening.  I've been keeping this to myself lately and it's been driving me nuts so I finally told someone I can trust at work about it.


Two days ago, a new guy started...I secretly checked him out.  He looks really cute wearing a baseball cap and has two pierced ears - about my height 5'3, 5'4.  His laugh though, is too damn cute.  He is skinny, though.  At a distance you wouldn't think he's anything really, but up close.  I was glancing at his lips and they look kissable.  Real kissable.  He's also Spanish.  I've only ever tried to talk to white guys or Asians.  I haven't talked to a Spanish guy.  I know one has liked me before and even though that person was closer to my age, cute, and was okay for me, I just wasn't attracted to him.


About this 18-year-old, though: we hit it off really well.  People saw us talking and into each other talking and stuff [we only talked about work and life, nothing too raunchy at all]...It turns out um, he is 18 and his uncle is one of my team leads to another part of my department, oh dear.  He also has an aunt who is in HR, too, ugh.  Oh, God...also, um, he's 18.  I'm not going to have a family with a freaking teenager.


He never made the moves on me which is what I like.  I like talking to him, just to have someone to talk to and he's cute.  That laugh though, gets my knees weak every time, but um, ya he's 18, wtf, and his relatives work here and some are my bosses, okay I got to keep telling myself that.  I wonder if that's the reason why he became distant.  He knows my age.  I told him right off the bat.


We talked on snap chat for a while, too, then suddenly he stopped reading my messages.  I have seen him in person since I sent the snap chat message about work, but he still hasn't read my message yet, the hell.


The other team lead a little bit older than me with the same name as me has a girlfriend as I suspected.  It didn't surprise me which is why I never told my main boss about the crush on him...however, I still laugh at Attention Whore trying to hang herself all over guy with the same name as me, even though he has a girlfriend.


But back to the 18-year-old.  His first few days here he would sit with me on breaks, and then I chatted with him today on break.  He seemed like he didn't want to talk to me anymore so I kept it short.  So the next break I saw him have with me, I pretended I didn't notice him and sat with my friends.


It's just as well.  Some of the people at my work like to gossip and I didn't want them giving the new guy a hard time because people are always talking about who is talking to me because they all know I'm a single young woman who is doing whatever the heck I wanna do...at the same time keeping it professional.


I just mainly talk to people at work for someone to talk to.  It isn't anything at all though some people like to make up stuff there.


I have to keep telling myself it's for the best that the 18-year-old is being distant now.  However, today, when he was waiting for his uncle who is one of my other team leads to give him a ride home, I was making small talk with him...and he laughed again at my jokes.  I gotta stop making him laugh because every time the 18-year-old laughs he just has a seriously hot laugh.


Signed,

WTF am I doing?


tl;dr  I'm tired of being alone.  I just want someone to talk to about stuff with the potential of it being more.  I want someone I'm attracted to, to be attracted to me, and to do something about it.  WTF am I doing crushing on an 18-year-old?!"
"I'm sitting at home watching videos for class and it starts talking about orotic aciduria(rare genetic disease). Guy in the video says, ""now its not Erotic aciduria like 50 shades of DNA but Orotic aciduria."" The complete randomness of it all his straight face made me bust out laughing. I giggled so much I have hiccups. 

Good times haha

"
"Dear Diary, 

I don't really know where to begin with this. So much has happened in the last month and, especially in the last two weeks. I think my brain is almost up to speed with processing everything, but my heart isn't quite there yet.

I don't remember if I touched on the fact that I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It's something I am open to talking about and I don't feel so ashamed anymore. In China, I'm getting proper treatment for my disorder. The hospital has been awesome in giving me the medication that I need and adjusting it so that it's perfect. I also have a counselor who is in-freaking-credible. She's helped me through so much and so quickly. So, at least I have that support. 

Halloween was supposed to be /AWESOME/ this year and it started out that way. All my friends got together, dressed up as the cast of Bob's Burgers and we won a costume contest at a bar. What I didn't realize, however, was the sort of effect the medication mixed with alcohol would have. I mean, I knew I shouldn't have mixed medication and alcohol, but I didn't realize what would happen. I figured that I would just end up drunk. I didn't think I'd black out after like, two drinks. 

I blamed my (then) boyfriend for all the unhappiness in my life. I told him that he needed to marry me because I've done so much for him, or I'd kill myself. And then I tried to kill myself several times. I don't remember any of this. Best Friend and (then) Boyfriend showed me videos and told me about what happened. 

I decided to move out of (then) Boyfriend's house. I was so ashamed for what I'd done. And I'd put the nails in my own coffin. I knew that he and I were going to break up. It was only a matter of time.

Adjusting to my own house was difficult for the first couple of days. Now I live it up. I really like having a nice house to come home to. I love the fact that it's mine and that there are no expectations of me. I can clean when I want and leave it dirty when I please. I don't have to worry about whether I need to share the shower or the TV (since I don't have a TV) and I certainly don't have to worry about sharing a bed.

I took a student to Flower World (maybe I'll start writing a blog about traveling or something) and while there, I found this poor, sick and abused kitten. I decided to buy it. I didn't even bargain for the kitten (usually I bargain things down a lot) because I just wanted the man to stop hurting him. Took the little fella home and then to the vet the next day. Spent every day taking care of that little fella. I hand fed him and administered medication. He seemed like he was getting better. He even climbed my leg. Then, I came home to find him in his little house I made for him, dead. 

Reaching in and touching his cold, stiff, lifeless body was the worst thing I'd ever experienced. I lost it immediately. I cried and I cried and I cried some more. It hurt. It felt like I had lost a child because I spent so much time taking care of him. Then, he just died. Mom said he was sicker than anyone knew and I believe it now...but at the time. Jesus is a Holy Man. I found every SINGLE reason it was my fault that my baby kitty died. Maybe I had touched something bad and then touched him. Maybe I hadn't fed him enough. Maybe he somehow had gotten too cold. Maybe I hadn't cleaned my house well enough and he got into something dirty. Maybe he was somehow exposed to contaminated water. There were so many more reasons I came up with. 

Through Sir Fritz Higginbotham's death, I learned the value of life. I learned that a little kitten I had known for just three weeks could have such an enormous impact on my life. And then I got to thinking about it and decided I couldn't ever take my own life because the people around me would suffer just as much as I did when Fritz passed. I never want to put anyone through that sort of pain because, to be frank, it freaking suuuuucks. 

Five days after this, (then) Boyfriend and I broke up. We decided that we aren't in a place to be together. I remember when he came over to pull the trigger, I begged him not to and told him that I would be better and promised him everything. He cried. I cried. But it's for the best. We haven't talked in a week.

Living in China without (then) Boyfriend and all the people I thought were my friends is a completely different experience. It's weird learning how to live on your own, without anyone to count on but yourself...in a foreign country. 

I've learned a lot about myself though, which is nice. I've learned how insecure I am and why I am that way. I'm learning to love myself. I found some sort of little seed and I'm watering it. I'm gonna get things figured out. I'm gonna survive. I've survived 100% of my bad days so far. What's another one or thirty? 

I'll post again this week. Probably a lot heavier details than today. Or maybe I'll post something about what a typical day in China looks like hahaha. 

Peace, love, coffee.

"Dear Reddit Diary,

Wow, another exclamation point in the title!  This month is going on stupendously!

Funny word that.  ""Stupendously.""  lol

ANYWAYS.  The week so far has been meh.  Since it's almost Christmas, a lot of people are on leave so it's been quiet.  On Monday when I came in for work, I was told that I had won November's safety awareness thing.

Every month, they choose 3 of the best health and safety thing and give each person who won a 50$ voucher and honestly, I did try my best 'cause 50$ is quite a bit of money so yea, I tried and every month different people would get it so I thought I had a chance.  But eventually, the same people kept winning so I guess everyone, including me, just like slacked off and just really stopped caring after a while.

Ok, I'm rambling.  

The point is, I won!  lol at least I can cross that off my list ahaha It really was one of my aims to get one so I'm glad I did!  Even though it was done half-heartedly lol I never really win anything so that was a nice surprise!  I'm gonna give it to Mum and Dad to use when they go buy groceries.  50$ is too much just for me to spend so I might as well give it to them to buy stuff for the house and siblings.  If it was broken down in like 10s or 20s I would buy a few things but I can't ""break"" it.  It's cool.  We can just buy more pie pans so I can have more pie!  Easy!

Other than that, nothing has been happening.  Saw an old buddy of mine and we chatted for a bit.  We were under the same program as apprentices but he started a few months before me but was under an unpaid internship I believe before he got picked up by this apprenticeship program.  That was cool.  I told him I'm thinking of going diving sometime in the next few months and he said he'd love to go but he has to make sure it's cool with his girlfriend and make sure he can afford it.  I did tell him to just bring her along if she wanted to come and to let me know if he could afford it so we can plan it more accordingly.  If not then it would be just me and probably family.  They don't dive though so I told them to plan something else for themselves so they don't get bored.

Haven't played much Hearthstone.  Like just to do my dailies but I'm really just waiting for Tavern Brawl and the next wing in League of Explorers.  IT'S TAKING FOREVER.  WHY.  Ok, ok.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow is Tavern Brawl then Friday is League of Explorers.  Soon.  SOON.

I'm meeting a couple of friends tomorrow for dinner.  Haven't seen either of them for a while so it would be nice to catch up.  Not sure if anyone else will be there actually.  Not that it matters lol I just want food ahaha

Oh, I've been reminiscing about Game of Thrones lately lol Like I remembered about stuff that happened all of a sudden so I started looking at Game of Thrones stuff.  Pictures.  Videos.  The books.  The maps.  GIFS.  Anything really lol I think I got a bit over emotional when it showed Robb ugh And Oberyn.  Ok.  I am gonna have a Game of Thrones marathon soon.  Be it the show or the books, I don't care.  I just need to fill this ache I have about it!

So yea.  This has gotten a bit long but, it's a diary entry right?  lol just some of my feelings and thoughts on things.  I'll end here.  

Goodnight, Reddit Diary!"
"Dear Reddit Diary,

So much for relaxing today!  I went out with Mum and Dad and youngest sister.  Went grocery shopping and other places.

I should probably start from Monday.  Or at least the weekdays first, then the weekend.  I will try to not make this such a long post!

First off, work was just meh most of the time.  I can't really remember what I did or any other details on it.   I am really just a robot right now when it comes to work.  Maybe it's time for another vacation lol But January is so close!  January I will be going to Singapore!  Soon!  SOON!

I already sent a video I made for my sister in the UK but as of yesterday, she still has not seen it.  She's busy with her school work and clinical attachments and studying for her upcoming exams that I can understand she wants to prioritize her time wisely.  Did manage to skype with her yesterday.  It will be her last skype session until mid December.  She's gonna be really busy the next couple of weeks.  The video I sent her is quite long though.  25 minutes!  Honestly, I guess there was so much to say that I lost track of how long I initially wanted the video lol Oh well

Monday was quite an emotional day.  I was clearing out my closet to give away clothes that no longer fit or use and I found all my old clothes when I was a kid.  From Nigeria.  From the old house.  From Australia.  From Disney World and Disney Land Paris.  From Barney.  It was so hard to give those away!  I kept my BJ shirt.  I can't give that away!  Especially the Disney ones!  I just COULDN'T give them away!  They weren't the fancy dresses like Cinderella's ball gown or Belle's.  Those were already given away and I didn't mind as much since I was such a tomboy but the Disney clothes I had were dresses.  Casual ones just for playing outside or going to the market.  Pocahontas was one of the them.  Snow White on another.  Dalmatians on the last dress.  But the Disney clothing I could not bear to part, was my Peter Pan.  It was just a shirt.  I think the pants are lost somewhere.  But there was no way I give that shirt up without a fight!  It's now on my Peter plushie.  Ok ok, no more.  I'm starting to get emotional.

So Tuesday was kind of a slow day.  I didn't do anything really but work and I think I watched a movie and played Hearthstone a bit.  Honestly, I can't remember anything else from Tuesday.  I could refer to my diary but I already put it away for the night so I'm just gonna say Tuesday was a nice, slow, relaxing day lol

Wednesday was the black out.  It was the longest so far this year and the past two years I think.  Unless you count the time these people cut our electric cable 'cause they were digging a hole on the side of the road ad had backed up so much into the cable line it caused it to cut in half.  That was a reeeeeeeeaallly stressful day for Dad.  He yelled at them and ordered them to get their boss on the phone and to move their digger and bulldozer elsewhere.  I don't think I've ever heard Dad yell.  Especially from like 30 meters away lol Anyways, Dad had the generator turned on but we didn't use it for long when the electricity came back on.  I think he waited about half an hour before deciding to have the generator turned on.  The last few times the power was out, he immediately turned on the generator and the electricity was back like 5 minutes later.  Wednesday was when I was gonna write an entry but I didn't want to do it on my phone or in the dark.

Thursday was dinner at my late grandparents' house.  I was gonna write after I got home from there but I got home late.  I do remember thinking the new adventure for League of Explorer's on Hearthstone would be out but it wasn't available yet.  I remember playing a lot of brawl so I could finish my daily quests for gold.  I also received a postcard!  I love postcards lol I got it from a friend who went to the Philippines!  Even though I may be running out of room on my fridge to stick them, I still want more!  

Friday I had lunch at my other grandparents'.  The new Hearthstone adventure was released then!  I rained pretty hard.  I forgot what I did on Friday night lol Friday is just complete zombie mode 'cause my brain is just totally dead from work by then.

Saturday was a loooooooooooooooooong day.  Went to youngest sister's high school graduation, then brunch out, then a car show (like car promos at a hall or centre, not sure what they're called but they're called car shows here), took an English exam at this place to see how competent I am (lol???) and then to the cinema to watch Mockingjay Part 2 with family.  My cousins and nephew and aunts were there with me, Mum, brother and youngest sister.  Dad wanted to go home after the car show and watch his own shows.  I was out for almost 12 hours!  12!  That should be a crime!

Sunday, today, was not as chaotic as yesterday but still, the plan to just lounge around got executed.  I did manage to sneak in a nap ahaha Best part of my week!  By far!  I did not play Hearthstone at all during the weekend.  Or as much as I wanted to.  I'm kinda sad about that.  Oh, Dad gave me his old Raybans today!  It was from when he was still a student but it's mine now!  I'd say it's an heirloom lol Now I don't have to buy my own!  I was planning on getting one in Singapore but, now I don't have to!

Mum made me lunch practically every day this week.  Lunch AND breakfast!  I feel bad but I love that I don't have to make it myself!  Plus it tastes yummy when she makes it so, she should keeping making me food right????  Total logic!

Lately I've been researching parts to build myself a PC.  My laptop is real old.  More than 5 years and I feel like she's barely hanging on!  I would get another laptop but honestly, laptops are for if you travel a lot and even though I travel a lot, I don't need a laptop so the logical answer would be to just get a desktop.  I was planning on just getting a ready-made one but then Dad said to just build one so, here I am now looking for parts I might like.  I am planning on buying them when I'm in Singapore so this just research for now.  Need to know the market.

I know I am forgetting a bunch of stuff to write but honestly, this is already so long and I want to sleep and too much happened this week and I doubt next week will be any different.  I want to take a day off work.  Maybe I'll call in sick lol I just want to do nothing!  Being an adult is tough.  I didn't sign up for this!  

Ok, Reddit Diary.  I hope this entry is to your satisfaction.  I don't know how I feel about this entry 'cause there's just so much in it lol Anyways, I'm gonna go to sleep.  Work.  Nyeh.

Goodnight!"
"Dear Reddit Diary,

I'm so sorry this entry is so late!  It was supposed to be on Wednesday but the power went out and by the time it was back on, it was getting late so I was getting ready for bed.  I was gonna post on Thursday instead but I had a family thing and didn't get back home till late and Friday, I was so tired from the project I'm currently on that I forgot to write so here I am now!  I promised twice a week and I will deliver!

Even if they are just small updates but I'll be sure to give more details tomorrow!  I was gonna do the first half of the week today then the second half tomorrow but I was out all day for like almost 12 hours.  Just a lot of errands and things to do.  Is this the life of an adult lol It's so exhausting.  I didn't even Hearthstone today!  Oh, the humanity!

lol Ok, I need to sleep.  Just so exhausted.  Hopefully tomorrow is a day of just lounging around and relaxing and just, doing nothing, maybe sleeping, yea, probably just sleeping.  I think I over fried my brain this week.  But don't worry, Reddit Diary.  You'll get to hear all about it tomorrow!  

Goodnight!"
"The whole Mizzou situation has been blowing up my Facebook timeline. I still don't know what exactly is going on that caused someone to do a hunger strike and everyone to dress in all black and take pictures. 

As usual, I like to sit back and observe until I get the most information I possibly can. The only event I keep hearing about in the most detail is the appearance of a swastika drawn in human waste on a wall. There has been chatter about other ""racially tense events"" that happen at the school but I don't know exactly what is meant by that. 

I also don't understand how pressuring the president to step down will fix the issues they speak of, especially since the president has said that he does not agree with or tolerate racism. I don't know what ever happened to the idea of ignoring ideas or dumbass people you don't agree with. Some moron decided to draw in their own shit like an idiot and people are damn near rioting all over the place. What the fuck? 

I'm tired of being made to feel like a bad black person by other black people who want to get offended at words. Fucking words. Have we really gotten that soft? Black civil rights leaders of the past got sprayed with fire hoses, attacked by dogs, and even lynched to achieve basic rights for us and people nowadays are doing hunger strikes because some troll decided to paint (IN THEIR OWN SHIT MIND YOU) a swastika? I would laugh if it wasn't so sad. I was actually really pissed off. Especially by the people who were saying the Paris attack was stealing the spotlight from Mizzou coverage. Are you kidding me? Over a 100 people just died in a terrorist attack and you are mad that the news is covering that over your hurt feelings? Get the fuck outta here. 

Then somebody sent me the video about the girl yelling at Yale about there not being an environment conducive to a safe space. Never has South Park been more true to life lmao. You're at Yale for fuck's sake. You are already more privileged than the majority of young people in the country (shit, maybe even in the world) by having the money and or opportunities to attend an Ivy League school and you're throwing a temper tantrum because you feel like the higher ups aren't doing enough to make sure everyone is not a racist/sexist/bigot etc? The last time I checked, its not possible to force someone to change their views and for staff to become the thought-crime police. 

I wish this generation would understand that in the real world, there isn't a safe space. There is no hugbox waiting for you every time someone says something that you find very offensive. You can't make it through life/be a functioning adult without realizing everyone isn't always going to agree with you and that sometimes people will sometimes say/do some mean shit to you. The appropriate response is not to bitch and moan about it but instead show those assholes that you will not sink to their level of fuckery.  

On a lighter note,  I just discovered Saikei and it is so beautiful <3"
"Dear Reddit Diary,

With the last phone conversation I had with H two weeks ago, I asked H what did he want could I see other people while he wasn’t talking to me or what?  He said he never said I couldn’t see other people…then I’m going to see other people.  I could have sworn H said before he didn’t want me to see other people.  Oh well, I do what I want, especially when he isn’t talking to me.  We aren’t official and he doesn’t want to make me his girlfriend so he doesn’t get to tell me what to do.  I don’t like to always work.  I like to have a life outside of work, too.

Now - 
Sitting in Guy’s car, I cuddle with him…actually he told me he had to go and was dropping me off but I wouldn’t let him leave just yet.  I try to move his lips near mine.  Man, I really want to kiss Guy.  He’s got me turned on now.  After all this fuss he doesn’t do anything, ugh!  I’ve only known him for two days.  We have plenty of time to get to know each other at work.  We only talked for fifteen minutes.

“Stop it, no.  I can’t kiss you.  I have a little cold and don’t want to get you sick,” Guy makes up excuses.
I want to enchant him with my kiss.  


Men have always told me I was the best kisser they’ve ever had, ha.  I don’t know if they say that just to say that but I feel like I’m a good kisser, especially when I’m really into the person.

Guy is the one to take my hand away this time and say, “Look, I don’t want to force you to do anything you don’t want to do.  All I want is a HJ – that’s it!  We don’t need to do anything else, okay?”

Maybe it’s a good thing he lives with strict parents.  I probe him to find out how many people he’s been with – only 4.  Good, not a high number at all.  Guy was hesitant to answer at first I said that’s not fair I told him everything about me he can tell me how many people he’s been with.  Maybe he didn’t want to answer because he didn’t want me to think he was a loser with a low number.  Actually, I like someone with a low number…less chances of catching anything.

Guy takes my hand and puts it on his “I don’t have a small D problem” part.  He definitely doesn’t have that small problem.  I like to kiss and fool around, too…not just fool around.  I imagine it would feel nice.  However, I told myself I wanted to stop at #20 with hook ups and H was #20.  The next person I hook up with is someone I intend to date.  If we don’t date, we don’t hook up.

“We can do other things besides sex,” Guy says.
At first I said no, but now I think kissing is okay.

I’ve wanted to kiss Guy this whole time without H in the back of my mind.  Maybe Guy has finally listened to me saying it’s the best when we are in love and now he won’t let me kiss him because he knows when he kisses me he will like me a lot and we have to see each other at work.

“I’ll do what you want if you do what I want,” I play Guy’s game.
I just want to kiss him – that’s it!  This kiss would be full of lust.



Guy really doesn’t know what I want.  I have confused the boy.


He gets frustrated, “Well, what do you want?”


He lists a few of the wrong answers.


I say, “I want you to do what you said you won’t do.”


“What kiss you?”


“Yeah,” I scoot a little closer to him.


“I can’t I can’t.  I have to go,” Guy pleads.


“Fine,” I sigh.

I wonder if it’s for the best we haven’t done anything yet, not even kiss.
All I did was feel him.

I have to forget, H.  I’m going to be staying in my new town for a while for at least a year and I don’t plan to move to the city any time soon.   Plus, H doesn’t want to see me during the weekend the only time I would have to see him.  Guy has the same schedule as me, he’s ten minutes away, and we can hang out at work and sneak out at night.  Plus, maybe this is a lesson for me to keep my cool with someone I work with.  I know I said I don’t want to date people at work, but I’m only ever at work that’s the problem.  And the other friend I met who is around the corner I appreciate that he is just a friend.  He’s going through some things of his own so it’s best for him to not date someone new for a while so I’m going to try to talk to Guy at work.


I thought about J, too – I have no idea if he is interested or not and I need to be talking to someone who is low key.  J is the team lead with all these girls crushing on him.  It’s going to turn out badly.
College boy is the best bet.

“I like hanging out with you.  We’ll continue to hang out in the future,” Guy says.


“How can we hang out when you can’t have girls over at your house?  You’re 21-years-old.  You’re working, paying for your own things.  You should have your own place,” I tell him.


“I am a young boy.  I like to live at home still,” Guy explains.


“You’re 21, not 18…And like you said, you are a young boy, should I be doing anything at all with you besides being friends?  How is this going to work?  We have nowhere to hang out.  I have a crazy roommate who doesn’t like my mom and I to have people over,” 

I’m mad.


""We'll figure something out,"" he says.


I finally willingly want to talk to someone new other than H and I don’t see how this is going to work.

Signed,


WTF

tl;dr I finally want to kiss someone new and new guy starts to back away a little after being so persistent the first two days he knows me...ugh.  I have to keep my cool with him because we see each other at work and I have no reason to blow up.  Just met the guy.  I hope he said no because he knows I'm still hurting about H."
"Dear Reddit Diary,

So second post!  Yay!  I am on a roll!  I love streaks.  Especially if they're winning streaks!  lol anyways this may end up being a long post.  Not so much a rant but just stuff has happened.  I've got Cars on.  It's my go to movie for anything.  It mostly becomes white noise to help me sleep.  Plus it's raining now so I think I'll be able to fall asleep real fast.

So this has got to be either the longest or shortest week of my life ever.  I feel like I am still stuck in last week but that this week is over.  I don't think any of that make sense but my brain somehow thinks this is still early early November but I understand it's almost mid November.  It feels like time flew by so fast but also real slow.  I swear it feels like last week.  Ugh whatever.

I think I have been drowning myself a lot in work.  I can't tell if that's good or bad 'cause I am just doing my job.  It's not like I am trying to keep myself busy from something.  I can't even remember what I did for work lol Stuff I guess.  The meeting was alright.  Can't really remember all of it but I know the next one is gonna be more ""interactive.""  Uhm yea I'm gonna take that day off lol Call in sick or something.  I don't want to ""interact"" with anyone.  I come to the mandatory meetings.  Isn't that enough?

I've been playing a lot of Hearthstone.  This week's brawl was really fun and it's been a while since I last enjoyed the game that much.  I hope they make co-op permanent in something.  I've been thinking of spending money on some packs but I think I'll hold off for a bit.  The game is in a bit of a slump right now and I don't play as much as I used to so I don't need to buy any packs right now.  I'll wait for a few weeks and see then.

I have literally gone out everyday this week.  I was planning on just staying home Sunday reading or watching something and maybe catching up on some sleep but family came down so me and my siblings went to see them.  Haven't seen them in a couple of months so I guess we had to.  It was nice seeing them though.

I spent all Saturday with a friend I hadn't seen since our holiday trip last month.  Had dimsum for breakfast (it was sooooo good!) and did some errands before heading off to her place to chill before catching a movie.  We wanted to take her brother to watch Goosebumps but their Dad said no ahaha Poor kid.  So I played Little Big planet with him for a bit so he didn't feel so down.  He doesn't really have anyone who can play video games with him so I sat with him till we left and I fixed a few things on his laptop.  The movie was alright.  The cinema was just real cold.

My Mum is pissed at me for doing something I'm not supposed to do when I went diving but I did it anyways so now she's ""banning"" me from ever going diving again.

Uhm.  Ok.  No lol You can't ""ban"" me.  And because I got pissed at her for being pissed at me, I thought about stretching my earlobes again 'cause I know that pisses her off.  Ugh I feel like such a child.  A petulant child with theatrics.  

Ok, I guess she is justified in being pissed at that thing I shouldn't have done but I am an adult.  I may not look it but I am one.  I'll probably just stretch my earlobes anyways 'cause I've been meaning to.  The fact it annoys her is just a plus lol My Dad isn't that bothered.  Everyone else is kinda disgusted with it.  It's really funny 'cause it's only about 3mm wide so you can't really see anything.  It was about 5mm before but I let it shrink smaller 'cause it was putting people off.  I think I'll just stretch them again.

It's just after 2300 hours and I have work tomorrow.  No amount of sleep will prepare me for tomorrow or the next day or the next or ever.  I just feel so exhausted.   I haven't even finished the video for my sister!  Why is there so much to do???  I haven't been running for the past few days and the guilt is starting to get to me.  Nyeh.

So this is a bit of a long entry and maybe twice a week isn't much but once is too little and thrice is a bit much.  Ahh whatever.  Hopefully next week is a bit slow so I can process it.

Ok, Reddit Diary.  I have to go to sleep.  I wish I could sleep for 300 years but alas, I can't lol Such is my life.

Until next week, Reddit Diary.  Goodnight."
"October 29th, 2015

Dear Diary,

The last couple of weeks have been a HAM, thus I haven't been posting. The reason I started posting in the first place is because my life is a hot ass mess and has been. This is supposed to be therapeutic for me. Upon saying that, I feel like I should put it out there that yeah, this started out being a not so serious diary, but it's progressively turning darker.

I started therapy a couple weeks ago. When I first began, I was a little nervous because I wasn't sure what to expect, going through therapy abroad. Was it going to be similar to the therapy I had been through once upon a time at home? Or would it be completely different? As I met up with her in the metro, I knew that it was going to be completely different.

She doesn't have her own office because office spaces here are very expensive. She doesn't have enough clients, as she caters, specifically, to foreigners. We walked to a quiet starbucks and ordered some tea before we began. She had prepared for many things---self-esteem building, stress relievers, anxiety triggers, etc. But, after she looked over the list of things that I checked off on her paper and after I described how I had these ups and downs, she was like, ""Stranded, I'm sorry to tell you this, but you're bipolar.""

I was floored. I wanted to cry right then on the spot. But I didn't. I managed to keep it together for a while. After our session, all I could think about was how now that I had a label, I was crazy and that I was just like my sister. The diagnosis snowballed and made the next three days incredibly difficult for both me and Boyfriend to get through.

I just got put on the appropriate medication a few days ago. It probably won't kick in for a few weeks, but we'll see. I don't really feel a difference. I am experiencing what's called a, ""Mixed Episode"". Basically, I feel extremely depressed but I'm also super high energy, so I get a lot done, but then I crash and want to cry at the end of the night. It's exhausting. I just want it to end. Hopefully this medication works and will do that for me.

Because of this whole Bipolar thing, Boyfriend and I had a long and serious talk. We agreed that, if in six months things weren't better between us, we are going to split ways. This, more than anything, depresses me. I don't want to leave him. I don't want him to be gone. He means everything to me.

A few days later, we had another serious conversation. I decided that I wanted to look at apartments to give myself some space. He was okay with this. I wasn't really. But while we talked about that, a few things came up. He told me that he's worried that if we did split up, I'd be wrecked because I think of him as my whole world. He is worried that he is the only thing that makes me happy. Which, by the way, is absolutely not true. He is not the only thing that makes me happy. A lot of things make me happy.

At least, that's what I said. Truth is, I don't really know what happiness is. I don't know how to experience it for more than a few fleeting moments. I should relax into a cup of hot chocolate and feel happiness as I drink in the flavor. I should feel happy when I accomplish something I'd been working on. I should feel happy when I do something well. But I don't. I don't feel happy very often. I feel happy when Boyfriend cuddles with me at night. I feel happy after a rowdy night with him. I feel happy when I'm around children. But that's about it. I don't experience much pleasure. And it's not that I don't want to experience pleasure, it's just that I can't. 

These aren't things that are easy to come to terms with. None of them. I had a dream last night about my first love. His name was Jordan. He went by Jim for a little while, I dunno if he still does. I want to get back in touch with him. Talking to him always cheered me up. I long to have a friendship with him again. I miss him. 

I get along better with guys that I do girls, yet, since I started dating Boyfriend, I have exclusively made female friends. I did it because I didn't want him to get jealous when I appear closer with a guy than him. But, recently, I've decided that it doesn't matter. He's so close with BFF, that it doesn't matter. I'm going to let myself be close with BBF. He and I connect so well and we have a lot of fun together. I avoided it for a while because I didn't want Boyfriend to get jealous. But now, because I'm immature and inconsiderate, I don't even care. I am going to be close with BBF because I like being around him. I'm tired of constantly taking Boyfriend's feelings into consideration when he doesn't take mine into consideration. It's time to give him a dose of his own medicine. It's bitter. But, it's time for him to see how he treats me.

I try not to be vengeful, but you know what? I have to play this game. I hate playing games. But, it's the only way I am going to get anything across to Boyfriend. It's evil. But it's necessary. 

I'm gonna go get some work done.

"I don't think there is anything better than going through the day after getting a lot of really restful sleep. The type of sleep you get only after being super satisfied. And it's always nice to go to sleep holding something other than a pillow. People are much cuddlier <3 That was just what I needed to get me through the rest of the week. 

I have no fucking clue what I'm doing for Halloween. My friends want to go to random frat parties and get fucked up but I honestly just want to sit around in fuzzy pajamas and watch cheesy old horror movies. Is that too much to ask? 

I'm also super tempted to buy a bunny onsie I saw online. Don't know where the hell I would wear it but it looked so comfortable. Damn Halloween advertising tempting me -_-"
"It's nearly winter, but snow has settled in and my breath could be seen, thinking about how this existence still matters to me under this grey pattern life of mine, my mind often colors up an idea, a very minimal idea that occurs only when I hear looming music in my headphones, to think about doing chores around the house.

This depression has gone along this ten-year road, we often go into disputes on which thought is more progressive, but we both give up on the fact that I forget about any progressive decisions, as my train of thought always derails to nothingness once again.

I smile time after time when I see my black puppy outside, my father doesn't let any animal in so I had built a dog house with a tarp over it, and a soft bedding under it, the winter here doesn't get that cold so it's less than anything harsh. She's still young, yet I would often get mad or irritated by her actions, like scratching my face or hurting a younger puppy violently, but that's what penalty boxes are for, and I would feel sorry later.

Raising her is my goal, as I try to make up from my childhood mistakes, ""one at a time"" I say, as I remember that me and my friends had no intentions of killing another dog, we all stood in fear and disbelief as we yelled or whistled at the floating yet immobile animal in the lake, thinking that after we thrown the poor soul out to swim again and again, that it would still be swimming, but the canine didn't have that strength anymore, the initiator of this ploy who I call an acquaintance now left in haste, as me and another friend both buried the animal deep into the earth in tears.

Guilt is my daily cigarette, as a non-smoker I feel envious of others addicted towards death, but as a person who experienced lung pain first-hand from bacterial infections and other lung illnesses, the fear of that pain has made me step back from taking a simple toxic breather like most have.

Running from reality isn't too hard, as I have a lot of time on my hands I tend to get into hobbies to make myself feel better, such as loud music, lucid dreaming and hypnagogic techniques without any help from drugs or plants, and I'm not talking about that spirally circle.

I don't really write alot, but I'll write again later."
"I guess I'll begin at the most current event.  Our neighbor.  So, the house next to us should be foreclosed on.  The mortgage is in arrears by about 15 months and the home owner is now in jail for a number (and I mean a number) of charges.  Weird part is I don't live in a dangerous or bad neighborhood.  It's in the middle of a historic Mid-Atlantic town (over 300 years old) and it's one of the wealthiest counties in America.  I have over 33% equity in my home I bought and remodeled two years ago. That's how fast home prices rose.  On the home front, things should be going great. But I dread that they aren't.  

So while in jail, my neighbor offered to sell us the home.  Money is tight, but I knew that my father in law wouldn't miss the opportunity to buy this house.  So we start the process.  And then, from jail he finds a renter.  The wife of somebody he's locked with.  WTF.  He says he wants to save the house. It's been in his family for over 100 years, etc.  That's fine and all, but if you think that in the end this will save you, your fucked.  You already got screwed over on one deal by a guy trying to steal the house from under you.  I can only imagine what will happen now.  But the renter, what a piece of work.  

The more I type the more I realize there is so much to this story.  Like the day I had to go to visitation to talk to Neighbor to make sure that he was renting the house out himself and not selling.  As I come out, I come to find out that the Renter is there visiting her husband.  How do I find out? She hit the parked car next to me.  She left a note with her name and the officer there knew who she was.  By reputation.  Officer acted like she's a wingbat.  I fear for my family.  

And today she was pissy with my wife b/c she says somebody is blocking her driveway so she can't park the work van she drives.  first off, if she was able to drive the fucking tank then it wouldn't be a problem.  But I already know she can't handle it. Second, if anything was blocked it was the lip of her apron, which is technically on my property line extended.  But, she should of been able to pull in.  But she got huffy.  And my wife isn't the type to back down so I don't see this ending well.  Cause my wife will say something back, but that bitch will probably hit and pull hair.  I don't know, I worry for their safety.  

And then there is also the issue of them either working on the house or doing some shit in the middle of the night.  At like 2 am they were moving in a washer and dryer one night.  Last night there was some sort of hammering.  Neighbor told me it was a 6 month lease, but that's 6 months too long.  That's if they ever leave.  "

Dear Diary,

Today has been spectacular! I have thoroughly enjoyed living today, which is like, opposite of yesterday. I woke up, not feeling well (pretty sure I caught a cold). When I got out of bed, I could tell today was gonna be different. Not only did I manage to get up before Boyfriend and Best Friend (BF), but I left the house before them too. I was in one of my rare, sparkly happy moods. 

Got to school. Everything was normal---except my classes behaved today. It was so weird. So then, after my classes were behaved, everyone in my office was cheery. I talked to SF today after I got done with my morning classes, which was awesome! I was really happy to talk. I always look forward to our conversations because, like, we’re definitely kindred souls. We experience things in a very similar way. It’s nice to be able to relate to someone like that. 

Anyway, when I went home for lunch, I decided to have McDonald’s again because Boyfriend was with Really Cool Friend (RCF). He had to help RCF go to the optometrist and order new glasses. I felt a little pang of jealousy because RCF and Boyfriend have been hanging out a lot lately, but seriously, they’re like brother and sister. When I woke up from my nap, I found that Boyfriend was sitting next to me. And he brought me the coffee I always order from Starbucks, which was incredibly awesome to wake up to. 

Got back to school and my class was super well behaved. I figured out how to deal with ADHD student and just had him help me click the button on the mouse. He was so happy that he behaved ALL CLASS LONG. Which he’d never, ever done before. When class had started, he even ran up to me and gave me a big hug. I was just super relieved that he was good today. I have been rewarding him for his good behavior.

I have just forty-five minutes to freedom. When I am done at school, I get to go home and prepare for Singapore! Actually, what I really need to do is finish up my Pokemon costume for tomorrow. BECAUSE TOMORROW I’M GOING TO A VIDEO GAME CONVENTION! I don’t have much left to do on it. The hard parts are done. I’ll probably go work on that while everyone is running.

Tonight, I am supposed to go over to RCF’s house. We’re having a pajama party. I’m pretty ecstatic about that. PJs are so comfy. I might even bring my sewing machine over there if I can’t quite get done before the party starts. Everyone is going running before RCF’s party. I want to go because I want to lose weight (and I ate McDonald’s for lunch), but, alas, this costume needs to be done. It won’t take too long. I will be relieved to have it done.

I’m thinking about writing an alien abduction story for nosleep. I don’t read too many of those. I’m not entirely sure how to go about it yet. I mean, I have the basic plot in my head, but I don’t really know how to present it. I know that I need to leave an element of mystery---just coming out and saying it’s about an alien abduction and vividly describing what happened is just ridiculous. There’s no way that can be written well. But, hopefully, I can figure out how to write it well. I like to think I’m a decent enough writer. We’ll see. Perhaps I’ll begin working on that when I get done with this entry.

I have to confess something, Diary. Even though I think the world of my boyfriend and I love him more than anything and he’s a fireball in bed, I have a crush on his best friend. Boyfriend’s Best Friend (BBF) is super freaking hot. He’s tall, handsome and has a perfectly symmetrical face. All the girls in our group of friends have mad crushes on him. He’s also really funny and open, yet still has this air of mystery about him. When I am around him, I sit up straight and I even occasionally put on makeup. Which is stupid. I would never, ever do anything with BBF. While I do believe BBF is boyfriend material (which is something I’d never tell any of the other girls in my group), I just know that he would never stack up against Boyfriend. Boyfriend is perfect for me. BBF is a silly girl crush that is super annoying. I just hope he does something stupid or says something really mean so that I can get over it. Because I’m putting him on a pedestal when there is no need to. He’s a person, just like anyone else. And he doesn’t hold a candle to Boyfriend. 

SINGAPORE IS FRIDAY! I’m so excited. We’re going to go to the zoo AT NIGHT and we’re going to go to a bunch of gardens and hike around. This is going to be so relaxing and incredible. I am really hoping that boyfriend will propose to me while we’re on the trip, but the prospect is super unlikely. I’m just itching to get engaged and take a step forward in my relationship. I feel like my relationship hasn’t moved in forever and I’m just ready for something interesting to happen. Maybe I’ll get lucky and it’ll happen in Japan. That would be something else. To be proposed to on top of Tokyo Tower---OH MY GOD. That’s like, my dream proposal right there. But we’ll see. 

Anyway, I’m going to make plans for my alien abduction story. I’ll write again tomorrow evening, after the convention and after I get ready for Singapore. Gah. I’m having such happy, whimsical thoughts. I hope that this giddy feeling never goes away.

Signing OFF!

Dear Diary,

Today I woke up and feel a little better than I did yesterday. I think that’s due in part to getting the perfect amount of sleep and having a fun time with my friends yesterday. 

Yesterday was my friend's birthday. But I didn’t realize it and I felt super crappy when I found out. She was pretty down in the dumps that I hadn’t said happy birthday to her. She said that she thought that I would make a big deal of it---but I had honestly thought that it was on Saturday, not yesterday. I got hers and another friend's birthdays mixed up. When I found out though, I decided that I was going to drop tutoring and Chinese class and spend the evening with her. She told me that I didn’t have to do that, but I really felt like I did because she’s been commenting a lot about how tutoring and money aren’t the most important things in the world. 

To me, though, money is very important. I need to pay off my school debt and I need to pay off my credit card debt. I want to pay off my car before the end of next year. I need to save up just in case my boyfriend and I get married in the next couple of years. We have to have enough money for our wedding. And of course, some day, we are going to want to settle down and we’ll need a house. Financial stress is definitely my biggest burden.

I talked to my friend yesterday about my argument with my boyfriend the night before last. She informed me that he feels very, very frustrated with me because he feels like I am not trusting in him. And he apparently is feeling a lot of pressure too, because he feels like he doesn’t know what he is going to do. The future is uncertain. He apparently needs me to be his rock, but I also need him to be mine. He wants a good enough job so that I can stay home and raise our kids. He’s afraid that he won’t be able to provide for our family. I didn’t realize he felt all the pressure that he feels. My friend is a great anger translator because I didn’t get any of that from what he said last night.

For me, I’m frustrated about my future because I, too, want to have a good job. Everyone keeps reminding me that I’m talented and that I have a lot of options---but I really don’t. I can draw, but not well enough to make a career out of it. I want to start getting into cosplay professionally, but I don’t think that I can make money off of it. And it’s not exactly easy to get into the business. I can write, but nobody makes money writing fiction nowadays. It’s all blogs and tabloids. You can find so many great things online for free, why in the world would I ever try to sell my books? To be honest, yeah, I’m good at a lot of things. But I am not great at anything. I get bored easily. And I don’t have any real-life practical skills. I’m no good with numbers. I am disorganized. My foreign language skills are sub-par, at best. I am just not even sure what I can do with my life. I like teaching, but with all the politics of teaching in the US, there’s just no way that I want to put myself through that. I don’t want to jump through those hoops. Teaching here is nice, but I miss my cats and I miss my mom and I miss home. 

Don’t get me wrong. Living in China definitely has an upside. I can always find something to do, no matter what time it is. Everything is convenient to walk to. There’s a lot of money to be made. I like my job a lot. But I really, really do miss home. I miss the convenience of some things from home, like having a dryer and having a big refrigerator. I miss being able to drive, though I totally dig public transportation here. I also really miss my cats, even though there are strays everywhere…which is how you know Chinese people don’t actually eat cats. 

I’m dreading tonight. Tonight is just going to be a HAM. Boyfriend and I are still a little rocky and then, of course, there’s the fact that there’s going to be drinking. The last time I got drunk, I screwed up my friendship with one of my closest friends for a while. I’m a little nervous that my boyfriend and I are going to fight or that I’m going to do something out of line. Getting drunk isn’t my cup of tea, but everyone else is planning on it and it’s expected of me because it’s a birthday party. I don’t want to be the one cleaning up after everyone and taking care of everyone. Drunk people annoy me when I’m sober. Tonight is going to be a little stressful. Hopefully I’ll make it through though. I’ll update you tomorrow with how this shindig went. 

Signing off.

"Yo, comrades:

As I said before screw Gary,[my enemy](https://www.reddit.com/r/DiaryOfARedditor/comments/3bt8p8/real_08012015_dear_diary_let_me_tell_you_about/), why my most interesting tales are always hijacked by him?!

I still remember the day my enemy hugged me…

It was around the time when he “talked to me like a normal person” we needed to make a bicarbonate volcano for the science class and we had to go outside because these things are very messy when they explode.

My classmates were going from volcano to volcano, looking how they exploded and whatnot. Now, I didn’t pay attention to Gary’s volcano because I’m not insane like he is. So I skipped it. There was no reason why he would go to see mine then. Perfect!

But he went to see my volcano and shit happened.

After I put…whatever you have to put to make the volcano explode (I don’t remember…) there was someone behind me, now, this isn’t something weird because my classmates would embrace one another to see when it was crowded.

I was okay until I felt a hand reach my shoulder and a *familiar* laugh.

Here we go again…

*Okay* whatever, I thought, It won’t scalate from tha…

He rested his head on my shoulder.

I could feel how he breathed on my back, and his annoying laugh next to my poor ears.

Okay, just wait until the volcano dries a little and then he will go away.

The problem is that when people were starting to leave he wouldn’t fucking let go. I was completely frozen. He was the last person to leave. Then when we got to the classroom he was throwing shit at my head like always. (Mostly paper balls)

My poor shoulder was raped. Twice. 

Now I have what I call “Post-Gary stress disorder” whenever I see him, I can’t look at him in the eyes…or any part of him, yes, even his stupid little red bag awakes a little alarm in my brain that screams to me “Run, Barry, Run”

I once fell down a pair of stairs trying to get away from him…but hopefully it was like five or six steps.

Now to the mysteries…fuck my life, more Gary giving mixed messages or something…

Mystery one: Karen.

Karen was a friend of Gary. Many people thought they dated but actually Karen had a boyfriend, I know because I was close to her too, she was good at French.

It was one rainy day...we exchanged classrooms because ours had a leak and the wall began to absorb the water. It was like a gigant zit.

Enter shitty classroom. It was smelly and like the year was ending we were assigned to watch “The notebook” yes, that one, fortunately for me Gary wasn’t there when I picked a random seat that I thought, he will never get close to.
And I was right, Gary was late (but before the movie even began) and sitted on the first bench, like he used to.

What I didn’t phantom is that I was sitting next to his goddamn group of friends *facepalm*

When I looked to another place, all I know is that Gary switched seats and now is sitting in front of me when the movie starts. Enter this conversation: 

Gary: Hey ThrowMyEnemyAway, you’re really good at French!

Me: I-I suppose.

Gary: How do you know so much?

Now, I hate Gary, so I wasn’t going to tell him the truth. So I picked the show I hated the most, like him.

Me: I…watch the walking dead with French subtitles.

Gary:  Did you hear that? She watches shows with French subtitles.

Random brainwashed friend: You two could be a couple.

No way in hell. To my surprise Gary says nothing. I was expecting some jerkiness but he was silent.

Enter next day, I’m minding my feline business, Gary is with Karina when overhear this:

Gary: So I started watchin' the walkin' dead *with French subtitles* It’s about a guy with a gun and...

If I had been really watchin' that...HE WOULD BE COPYING ME. I wasn't supposed to hear that, but it's creepy anyway.

Surprisingly this isn’t the last time I heard of Gary, my enemy, but it will be until next time.

"So uhh, just wanted to share this. I turn 18 in August the 2nd and every man who turn 18 this year have to present themselves at a Military Conscription Center. I did this today and they told me to present myself at the local military base in September 23rd, 7 a.m.

I'm even supposed to pay 4 bucks. 
"
"It's the whole ""my boyfriend wants to hang out with the guys and not me"" deal. I guess it's just because I'm a bit sensitive to this topic, having lost all my IRL friends as casualties of moving and getting out of an abusive home situation, and all of them sort of... faded away because I had so many unsolvable problems and I was a hassle to have around because of all the things my mom would do to manipulate and control me even when I wasn't home. (This meant my friends would have to drive me home exactly when she said for me to come home, etc. It got to be too much for them so... I ended up uninvited to everything or was just never told about events.)

Well, my boyfriend has great friends that I've met and hung out with, but... of course he wants time alone with them. It's just... I don't know anyone here at all. Internet friends are great, but... it's just different when you go out and hang around others, y'know? And when he leaves to go have his fun, I'm just here, alone. I don't have my own car and I can't really afford one for a long while, and I work at home... I go on walks outdoors near the house, but I'm still alone. I'm a social person, I love people and talking to them, and it's just draining to not have that available... boyfriend is an introvert so he doesn't really understand, I think. 

I'm just lonely, I guess. And it hurts my feelings more than it should when my boyfriends hesitantly tells me that he wants to hang out with his friends alone. I know why I feel that way and it's selfish, but you know, I'm human and I need people, too."
"I think the concept of this subreddit is fabulous. Looking forward to getting to know people and sharing thoughts!

So here's my deal... 

I've been engaged for 1.5 years, and my family doesn't know about him at all (except for my sister, who is not supportive [that's a whole can of worms], and my cousin, who is supportive but is probably too young to be of much help). Something has to give, and soon. My parents are ""traditional"" and made a big stink for 3 years about my sister and her now husband- emotional manipulation, angry tear-filled phone calls, suicide threats as blackmail, the works- before deciding to accept the fact of him and throw a huge fancy wedding for them in order to make themselves feel better. 

I don't imagine this one will be any better, because there are many more reasons for my fiance to be ""objectionable"" to them, than there were for my brother in law. He was the ""wrong"" skin color. Mine is the ""wrong"" age, has a divorce under his belt with split custody of 4 year old twins (I adore the girls and they me, and it's sometimes challenging, but really I have it as easy as can possibly be in terms of relationship with stepchildren), AND is the ""wrong"" skin color. 

He is so wonderful, but I panic when I think of everything that needs to happen before we can get married. I panic at the idea of 3 years of my family's ridiculous shit. I panic at the concept of telling them about him, and them refusing to meet him for 2 years. I panic at the thought of having to endure their big dog and pony show of a wedding they will insist on throwing, in which they do their level, stressful best at making us look ""palatable"" to their hive-mind community as a couple. 

I also panic, sometimes, at the thought that being a stepmother will continue to bring challenges. It is really hard navigating these uncertain waters and figuring out the balance. My fiance helps me to the extent that he can, but he is their father and so there are some empathy gaps there on both ends: they are the world to him, and I love them but I don't have the same connection with them as he does, and I never will. 

He moved into a new place in the past week, and I took a day off work to help him, worked with him the whole weekend, and we've been continuing to make the home together. In some ways I feel like a traditional ""lady of the house"" in a nice way- like I get to decorate and make decisions and do art for the place, and we bought a fancy dining room set together and are going to get fine china for it, and I spent hours making a fancy guest basket for the bathroom and painting a centerpiece for the dining table. If I lose myself in these tasks (I'm an artist whenever I'm not at my day job, and have an amateurish interest in interior decoration), then I don't freak out. 

I want to move into the same apartment complex as him. It's not worth the battle with my family to live together: I'm saving that battle for when we get married. Also I like my own space. 

I'm freaking out because I know I'm going to have to tell my parents soon, and endure everything they throw at me. They feel completely justified and in the right, and while I know they are wrong, I still care about them and don't want them to suffer. It will be their choice, of course, to suffer... but I still don't want them to suffer.

I envy my friends who are already married and who didn't have to deal with any crap from their families about their choice in partner or their right to live their own lives. I envy my single friends too, because they don't have to face this- they have in front of them the possibility of meeting and falling in love with someone who is entirely convenient, as strange as that sounds. 

There are times when I think I could walk away from all of this: the family drama (which I won't be able to truly walk away from: they will make some variety of big stink about whoever I choose to marry, pretty much unless I let them arrange my marriage), and also the stress of being a stepmother. But the very thought of walking away from my fiance breaks my heart a little- the THOUGHT I mean. The thought of living without him- the thought of hurting him- everything. 

I feel like a stereotypical milennial, afraid of commitment... but the things I have to commit to are so huge and scary and alien to me. Potentially alienating my entire family forever (or having them make my life hell for years, at the very least), in order to live a hard life of being a 50% step-parent? I'd be doing this all for and with someone I love... but for him, only good changes will happen in his life once I'm formally part of it. I'll be stuck in the city I'm living in for the next 14 years, which isn't a bad thing- I love my city- but I've never lived out of state and now it looks like I'll never have the chance. Where I live will be dictated by good schools for the girls who are in fact not my children. A lot of my life will be dictated by the girls' best interests. I feel it would be different if he and I had had, or adopted or something, the girls together- where I had some say in the decision to have them- and therefore we were both, as a couple, reconciled and committed to realigning our mutual priorities for their well being. Instead, the girls were born before I met him- when I was 22- and now I'm deeply invested in their father, for whom they will always be first. It's a little scary to think that he will never put me first- that no one will ever put me first. And he shouldn't. He should put his kids first. If he had the choice to save me or the girls from being hit by a bus, he should of course pick the girls. 

But he's the one I would save, beyond anyone else. 

Basically, I'm scared. "

Work was boring and depressingly dull. 

That's it; that's all I got."
"well, I don't even know if we're considered best friend anymore. hanging out with her feels... exhausting. I care about her deeply still, and she's like family to me, but I honestly don't know where we stand right now. we live in different cities since 3 years ago, and I felt like we've slowly drifted apart since then. no... even before that. her and I have completely different personalities. she's turbulent, frantic, and tend to keep to herself. I've always knew that and I accepted and loved her as who she is. however, I feel that this trait of hers has taken a big toll on me. she does not know how to handle her emotions. every little things will be the worst thing in the world. when stressful situations arise, my first reaction is to find the most sensible solution and minimize the damage, and hers, well, is to get really pissed off and scream and overthink the unrealistically absolute worst thing that could happen to her. something happened today when she came over to visit my city. I tried to help her by being calm and find solution as soon as possible, and she got angry at me for being ""too calm"". stressful events aside, I just feel like she's not having fun when she hangs out with me. she seems miserable and pissed all the time, but I can clearly see from social media that she's able to have fun with other people. I think we just grown apart so much that we're just not the same people from before. I want to talk to her about it, since this has been weighing on me lately, but I'm not sure how she'll respond. will she even be willing to talk about this? I don't know her enough now to guess an answer. I still want her in my life, but something has to change."
"I just watched and finished a commercial video upon opening a YouTube app and another episode in The Crown Season 4 --- a message that triggers me to detox. I don't want to elaborate on the details but it reminds me of what I must do next to detox again in some areas of daily life. A solid detox with discipline is the goal starting today. Hey, no worries I'm still here on Reddit whenever I have time.

Keep slaying those dreams my fellow Redditors!💋 and Make It Happen😈"
"I bought a car from my boss. He got it for free as part of a job that we're doing. I said okay it's because it was only $500. Today is the first time I actually drove it. I realized it has a ton more issues than I expected. I made it to go pick up a fix, but as I am about to start the vehicle to pull away from his house, it dies when I put it in reverse and will not start again. I try to crank it over a few times, and then he calls me. He just wanted to know if everything was okay, which I'm guessing was actually going to be“are you going to be leaving soon, because you really need to.” I throw it a neutral and push it over a couple lots to where nobody is parked. After trying to start it a few times I finally get it going. Instead of risking it, and driving back to the house, I drive it three blocks over to the shop. I park it up and make sure it's locked, grab the few things that I had, and start walking to the house. As they start writing this post, I realize I had my wallet in the car and now I don't. So I turn around and head back toward the shop. Now I'm thinking at this point about driving the car back to the house. I guess I will think on it for a while see what happens when I get there and update you later after this journey is finished.. wish me luck..............
2 Seconds later.... .. ..
PI get back to the car, and realize I have blocked all of the doors and now while I was sitting right on the center console of the front seat. I hop in the car put the key in the ignition turn the lights on, and see if it will start. I get it started, and then start to time the traffic light so that when I leave the parking lot, the light is green in the direction that I want to go. The way home consists of almost all right hand turns. In the state of Florida, as in many other states of the United ones, you can turn right on a red light, as long as you stop and yield to the traffic coming from your left, as well as there are no posted signs saying you may not turn on a red light.my time every light that I hit on my way home, to be green as I am coming up to it. The license plate that I have on the back of the vehicle is something that I just grabbed off of the wall at the shop. I don't know what vehicle it is actually registered to, I see that it is already 4 months overdue, but still decide to risk it to get home...
I get home with no issues. I speed walk to my room, open my backpack to grab my syringe and paraphernalia, proceed to empty two caps worth of fentanyl into my mixing cap, add 70 cc's of water, suck it up into the syringe, and tie off my right arm. I watch for the red mushroom cloud to fill the syringe. As soon as it does I push the plunger in, quickly pull off my homemade turn again, and prepare for the concoction to hit me.................. 8 seconds later, euphoric, beautiful, loving, perfection..... And lay my head down in proceed to nod off.


Mission accomplished"
"i only slept 5 hours and i woke up the moment the online class started and i took like 4 classes the rest either didn't show up or didn't make a class and i remembered that i need make sure to get full mark in participation in class because last term i missed 7 marks because of it and I'm planning on entering medical school which requires you to get at least 98% in all of highschool and when it was like sunset i slept and woke up at 11pm and realized i haven't done any of my today's goals so i went to the barber got a haircut took a shower and cleaned my room and meditated and studied for less than an hour and went to sleep at 2 am also couldn't think of 3 things that made me happy tomorrow I'll try to by noting them down the moment they happen

"i guess this is context to all of my future diaries and before i start introducing my self I'll throw in somethings about me my first language isn't english so don't expect any punctuation marks and I'm not professionally writing this so if i say dumb things I'm not going to delete them and rewrite them in a better way in fact i already have a lot of things that i already wrote that i want to delete but i won't be doing that since it's a diary about my mental and physical health I'll start of how i grew up

i grew up with only one of my parents and 2 siblings (does this even count as personal info?) and since i was a child i was nothing special or out of the ordinary never felt like i was different from other children and when i reached elementary school my life was normal i was ordinary and i didn't have any family besides my siblings and parent and the neighbors didn't have any children my age so in summer breaks i never really found anyone to play with so I'd spend my time on the family computer and i was 7 and it was the time i started picking up english words so when i reached 3rd grade we moved out and things were still mundane by the time i reached 5th grade i realized i was a little different from the other kids either they were dumb or i was smarter but i guess i was able to learn a lot faster than them and it slowly isolated me from the class because i was ""tryharding"" in class they just thought i was boring i guess I'd always hear them (a circle of friends that make up 80% of the class) talk about going out somewhere after school and I'd always try to include myself or be social but that image of me being that kid never changed to them i guess and by time i reached middle school i was able to read english and understand it pretty well and i made a lot of friends who i still have and lost some in my first year of middle school i got 100% on everything and that obviously ended my entire school social life immediately but i didn't care because i had close friends online and in my second year of middle school i started to realize the state of my parent they didn't have a jop so we had basically zero income spoilers: we still don't and that made me super stressed out for weeks i thought in highschool we would be super poor but after a few weeks i guess i kinda forgot about it and that time is the time I found out about porn and i didn't fall into the slippery slope dick first i used to just masturbate once a week but in my first year of highschool i used to masturbate twice everyday and about my social life in my first year of highschool as you would guess i just get good grades and try to be social to see if it works and it obviously didn't all my classmates interests where very different than mine i don't know if it's because i delved in too deep inside the english culture? anyway my 2nd year of highschool which is now the virus made it online and my siblings if you remember them one of them my brother turned out to be a druggie and the other turned out well but my brother came home once drunk and my parent freaked out because he's underage and kicked him to live with the other parent which i forgot to mention is a schizophrenic mentally unstable person as you would've guessed it affected me and my brother now is homeless so back to me i have a porn/masturbation addiction and i haven't took a shower in 3 weeks and i usually sleep 4 hours everyday you'd think in all that free time I'd watch entertaining things or browse the internet while having fun what I'd do is do things i previously enjoyed but feel like i shouldn't be doing them and not feel happy so when i watch something i like i can't even watch 10 mintues of it because of the immeasurable feeling in me that says that i shouldn't be doing this i should be doing something else so i end up spending the whole day doing absolutely and literally nothing so I'm planning on forcing my self to do things that are good? for me like showering every 2 days and eating healthy and exercising and studying because if i do these i can finally enjoy doing things i actually like doing i think it's gonna work tomorrow is the first day I'll write down how my day went and what good things i did and I'm also gonna sleep 8 hours today or at least try to"
"I was thinking about it the other day. I miss the older times. The times you didn't know you'd miss because you were only living in the moment and it was the only way you knew how to live. My feet burning while I walked barefoot on the rocks by my house in summer days. Jumping and laying on the trampoline, listening to the same cd on my cd player. My brothers and I messing around with the water hose outside, getting ourselves wet, feeling our bare feet wrinkle the more we were out there like that, feeling the warm sun hitting our skins. Setting up the pool on other days, and spending endless hours in there. Visiting my grandma next door, watching cartoons, eating her homemade foods. These were the days I never imagined as a kid that I would miss. Back when my biggest problems were making sure I had batteries for my cd player, and making sure my nintendo ds was fully charged to play it at night. The more I remember about these certain memories, the more I want to go back. I guess the only thing I can do is appreciate the memories I have. And do the same thing I would do then as a kid; try to live in the moment, because that's the only way you should know how to live."
"I feel so useless. My only worth is making money, and money comes from others, and when the money is exchanged an invisible shackle is formed that I'm too weak to carry anymore. 

My art is all I got. And no one wants art unless it's porn, or I'm dead.

And it's not like I dislike drawing porn, but a porn artist is doomed to be in that niche, at the demand of the fanbase confused why the new picture isn't the fetish of the day.

And a safe for work artist scares off their base if there is a penis.

I'm so tired of feeling moot and small.

Not like you reading this will support me. It's hard being an entertainer and at the end of the day I still dance for coin.

I hate this."
"9:01 pm 

This is my second entry. 

For days I’ve jumped back and forth from feeling such an intense sadness that i haven’t felt in a long time, to feeling motivated to turn my life around and finally be happy with myself. 

But the motivation and spark slips away. I haven’t learned how to keep it yet. It feels amazing when it is here though, that I feel so calm that I actually feel in my bones that I can do anything. But once it slips, it slips. The doubt and fear moves in where the warmth and hope and even excitement was just at moments before. 

I’ve talked about it before, but a big part of why I jump back and forth with these feelings is me wanting to be perfect in every single thing I do. But then I think about it logically i tell myself that I’ve never done anything in my life perfectly, then I get upset because I haven’t. I compare myself to so many people on social media, saying “they’re perfect, why can’t you be like them?” Its this endless cycle I put myself through and i don’t know how to stop. 

On Wednesday I’m going to call about therapy and if they accept my insurance. I’m nervous about it but I’m ready to finally be able to get so many of my feeling and thoughts out. Not having any of my friends to talk to has been very difficult, but they’ve shown that they’re not friends. I’ve always tried to be a good friend and be there for them for any problem they have to offer and sort of advice or a shoulder to lean on when they need one. But when I need one for the first time in a long time, they’ve basically disappeared. It’s not fair. 

Though, I’ve tried to write some poetry. Or how I think how a poem would be written. I haven’t read much poetry and have never done so before, but I’m trying. It’s helping get some of my thoughts out. I have some good starts I think, none of them are finished and I’m sure they won’t be for a while. 

It’s funny though because I’ve never written poetry but I’ve imagined myself becoming a poet and being able to help people through what I’m going through now. I’ve done this with so much other careers. Like writing, I’m a terrible writer and it shows through even here. Or becoming a pianist, I don’t know how to play the piano. But I’ve convinced myself that I can learn and become so good that I get a great career out of it. Logically I know I could never do it, but there’s the smallest sliver of hope that it could happen one day. It’s delusion I have to remind myself. 

I just don’t know what would make me happy. I don’t know myself enough to know what things I like doing. I’m stuck in this routine that I go to work, deal with school, and watch tv to zone out. I’m trying to find myself though, I’m reading more and like I said writing more. I think I’m just scared to do things alone. But it has to be alone. 

One day I’ll be happy. 

I have to remind myself that or I’ll go insane."
"If I could just release my love, If I could just release my love, If I could just release my love

Id feel this weight lift from above. If I could just release my love

But why does this have to be so tough? Yes there were years that went by so quick, I had never seen a love that was matched as perfect and quick. The puzzle seemed to fit, But no one saw it ending like this. Fast forward to real time, That was just the past So why is my heart stuck there? Why do I still feel a part last? Its done, its over, its been many years since then, Many toxic remarks that will never be taken back, No one will ever win.Yet my heart still holds a special place in time, Those memories are stickier than glue, But since I’m holding on tight I might as well admit, my love for you is burning blue. It isn’t gone, there’s a flickering light You hold the switch,- so I guess you know its there? But when I think of what’s going on, I question my reality, None of this seems fair.

How do I get my point across, It never comes out right, for all I know he’s still telling lies, he thinks he’s protecting me, he thinks I can’t handle the truth, “all I do is fight”

Thats not who I am, I know who I am, Thats not who I am, I know who I am

I hurt myself with memories that have burnt me, opening different wounds. Am I finding memories that fit my fight, or, can I let go and put out this light. I want to be better, and show the world I can, But how many times can I rebuild myself before people start to believe that’s just not who I am? I have so many reasons why, so many motivators to set forth. I know my personal why, I know my goals are pure. But, its not like I have a compass- good = north. I know Ive hurt the people who have stuck by me, more than anyone else. I know their love is golden, and values more than wealth. 

My emotions get the best of me, Its not like I ever have the intention of these panic attacks, They creep up so quickly, If I had a crystal ball that could let me see, what my future self would do, I could prevent this anger from getting the best of me, I wouldn’t sink to the floor. I have so many thought to do better, but the depression ones seem to be more. I feel pathetic, at my age, still acting like a fool, I need a damn crystal ball, or at least some type of helpful tool.

\* If I could just release my love, If I could just release my love, If I could just release my love. Id feel this weight lift from above. If I could just release my love

But why does this have to be so tough? Its not the person I miss, although I feel like I got so wrongfully screwed, its not the idea of our past I miss, its the idea of my family dissipating like eaten food. It’s the idea of us, being more than we could ever be, but I feel like I tried so hard, with so much put into this, how can it turn to this, in a family feud. My ideas are not balancing, the stark contrast is too relevant. Past to future. Reality vs ideas. But why knowing what I do, how can I act so hell bent? There will always be regrets and things I wish I can change, but Ive said sorry each time and that still gets me no where. Its a vacant word, probably just used too many times. I know he’s watched me grow up. He’s watched me try so hard, but he’s watched me fall further. It would be toxic of me to blame anyone, but myself, especially for where Ive landed, but how do I reach out for help, when I feel so abandon. I walked away from everyone, each time dangling like a carrot I’m here, but one emotional slip up and I walk away like I was not ever there. I guess that sounds like the love Ive been given. Maybe that’s  where I’ve picked up to treat the people I love like this, the way he has shown me these last few years, Im projecting the pain I receive so it no longer stays within. I guess that sounds like the love I’ve been given.

\* If I could just release my love, If I could just release my love, If I could just release my love. Id feel this weight lift from above. If I could just release my love

Im here, sad, picking myself up. I pick myself up because little eyes watch and follow as I do. If she wasn’t with me, I don’t know what I would do. I have a hard time with change, I’ve become jealous of anyone who has what I want, its sad to see the truth, but its what I must do.I give myself anxiety, by thinking about the future, so I try to stop myself, before emotionally experiencing it twice. Is the picture becoming clearer about the fight in me, and why I give myself so much anxiety? It just feels like a movie, each day passing by. How do I leave purgatory, no longer on this wall, just sitting like a fly, feeling like its a movie, with each day passing by? Every night I lay my head to rest, and fall asleep in peace, but waking up is a different story, who knows how I will be? Many highs, matched with lows, you could see why no one would want to gamble. Filling an over flown water pot, so heavy you loose the handle. I know by now this just sound like a ramble, but for me, I’m letting my voice be heard, letting it all out before I blow my top. How do I complete myself, my soul knows who I want to be, but its the rest of me that seems to have forgot."
"Dear diary,

Oh man. We were so good for a few days. We usually are when you’re working. We do even better when you’re on projects. I know you see this but you say you “miss us” when you’re gone. Man, you sure know how to show it.

I thought we made progressed. My girlfriend is pretty wonderful, by the way. She said she might want to have a threesome, even though she’s a lesbian. You were kind of nonchalant about this when I mentioned it, even though it’s what we have talked about wanting together. But you guys met and it was such an amazing first meet-and-greet. You two really hit it off. The next day, I asked if I could meet up with her to see how she felt about how it went. You said yes, of course, it was fine. You had also been drinking since the morning, and I know you hadn’t been drinking for a couple days. You were probably more tipsy than I realized at the time. Later that night, you made plans for the next day. After your phone call, I made sure for a second time that it was okay that I met up with my girlfriend. You were fine with it. You kept drinking. Awhile later, you asked if I wanted to hang out with some friends the next morning. I reminded you that I was going to meet up with my girlfriend to talk and hang out for a little while. You acted as if it was new information and became upset, upon retrospect. You have been mad and distance since then.

That was yesterday. You met her on Monday. You came home from your work trip on Sunday after two long hard days of work. You pretty much have not stopped drinking since you came home from your trip. Today you were short with me and ignored me unless you really needed something from me, which was twice. I didn’t even know you were mad at me about me meeting her today until you sent me a text message after I left this morning. Why couldn’t you talk to me about it when I was making plans? Or when you woke up in the morning? Or before I left? I’ve tried talking to you about it many times. You won’t communicate with me. I apologized three times, saying I was sorry if I didn’t let you properly know. I asked you how I could do better, what information I should have given you. You’ve been slamming doors and making snide comments and more than anything, ignoring me. My heart hurts. I wish you would communicate with me better. But I know it’s because of your drinking.

I can’t wait to be done with school so I have more options. I full heartily admit, you’ve made a lot of progress over the years and I’m still rooting for us. You have until I finish my masters. If my heart still hurts this much with you, I’m gone. I am still giving it my all food now, I promise."
"Well, my mom got coronavirus. It’s been around a week and a half and she seems to be doing alright. But now my dad is saying that he has chills and body aches, and honestly I don’t really care. 

I don’t know if it’s ok for me to feel like this because when it was confirmed that my mom has coronavirus I cried whenever I thought about it, but with my dad I just don’t care. I wouldn’t care if he died. 

I think the reason that I feel this way is because he put my mom and my siblings and I through absolute hell. He’s a narcissist. 

Sometime in late 2020 my brother(20) and sister(17) decided they had enough of his bullshit so they moved out into a tiny hotel. I’ve been to the hotel and it’s literally one room. So while my dad stays in this 5 bedroom house, and only uses *one* of the rooms, my brother and sister are living in a tiny hotel. 

I think that a good father that genuinely wants the best for his kids would have realized his mistakes and moved out. But no. All my dad does is say “Oh that’s terrible.”

And another thing is that my mom told me that my dad told her “You would have to bring me out in a coffin if you want me to leave this house.”

I can go on and on about the times that he’s been narcissistic, but the post would be way too long.

Anyway, my dad probably has coronavirus, which means that he’s probably going to die. I will only mourn what my dad could have been."
" I have never been in this much pain, ever in my life. There is a constant ache in the left side of my chest while i try to wrap my head around what happened yesterday. This is the worst thing that could have ever happened to me, honestly it is such a shame, i am so embarrassed and heartbroken i honestly need help, i have been acting weird the whole day today, no appetite, i don't feel like talking to anyone, my mom thinks this is due to the cold.

I couldn't sleep yesterday. My heart kept racing the whole night, i would burst into tears, then slowly slip into sleep and then suddenly, i am up and the realization of what has happened would engulf me into this sea of pain. Sharp pain in the chest. The world, once again felt extremely cold, harsh and full of pain. I feel hopeless. All the little dreams i wove, this cannot be the end of the story, I know it isn't but it for sure, hurts like hell.

My heart started racing the moment he said he wanted to say something to me. I knew, i could feel it in my bones that something is not right, i pulled the blanked over my head and cried over what i saw on the screen. He thinks i am ruining my life being with him. He is lost, full of stress caused by the burden of expectations of everyone. He doesn't know where his life is going I understand, and i tried explaining that i doesn't matter and that i am with him no matter what, but he doesn't want me to waste my time.

 I wish i could refer to all the texts, but he deactivated his Instagram account. Even turned off his last seen visibility. I don't know if he deleted my number of what. It was a roller coaster, firstly tried to shun away the thought that he's wanting to end it, but sadly, it's what he wants me to do for the best of both of us. I do not believe this at all that ending this relationship is helping his situation at all, he thinks he doesn't give me time that i deserve and can't guarantee if he will be able to do so even in the future. 

I tried to find a middle ground, but he is fixed on the thought of ending it. He said he regrets ever asking me to be his girlfriend, that it ruined the situation, and that he wished we could be friends like we were in school, once again. That he wish he could still talk to me and share his feeling and that it helps him relieve a little, but he can't promise someone a future because all of this is burdening him.

I never complain about not being given the attention and time i desire, i understood all along the responsibilities he had but never saw this coming, never thought he would just ask me to walk away like this. I am ashamed of how much blind trust i had on him, never in my wildest dreams i would have imagined this to happen. All the promises and reassurance he gave me in the start just faded away. I cannot blame him, life is unfair and if he thinks this is what will help him, even a little bit, i will happily walk away, but it is unpractical and i know deep down, he will regret this. 

He says that he doesn't want to lead this thing on and end up disappointing me, so he broke it off, but i didn't tell him that this pain is much worse than anything poverty, unemployment or hunger could ever cause. 

Not gonna lie, i even suspected it to be a plan to get rid of me. Of course I am not the prettiest the skinniest girl but i would have died for him. It is just my anxiety acting up, i am probably just overthinking that he doesn't want me and this ugly face but i think i should write this down, for the sake of it, to get it off my chest.

The worst part is that i can't talk about it to anyone, the amount of pain i am in. This is the most important year of my life so far, i have to establish my career, i have to secure my first ever job but this bomb he dropped just turned everything dull and hopeless. I don't know when will this dull pain in my chest ever go away. The more i was trying to be productive this year, the worse this year got. 

None of our common friends tried to talk to me, what a shame. I don't know whether he didn't tell anyone about this yet or just tuned it a little bit to make it look like i am the villain but it's hard to suffer like this alone in the world. I have been faking smiles since the morning, it's hard, my family keeps asking if i am well, all i can do is lie. Ingesting anything feels like hell, i vomited out the biscuits my mom forcefully fed me with the tea. They probably think i am being a lazy bitch but i am miserable. 

Though he is so far away, i always felt so secure and hopeful that there is someone out there who i could call mine. The world seemed a little softer and easier but guess now i am to step-1 once again, paranoid of the future, and with an endless feeling of loneliness. The love i have for him is never going anywhere, i know, we will someday reunite and get married but for now, i feel defeated. I don't know what i did to deserve this. 

I asked him why would he do this, why can't we just have a happy ending and why he keeps saying that he is ruining my life. He just said that's how his life is. It's never happy. He said he doesn't mean that we should stop talking, that we were friends, and we still are, but he can't be in a 'relationship'. I asked that eventually he would have to marry someone. Won't then he'll be ruining someone's life? He goes,  he don't know if he'll make it till then, then i asked him to answer the question, then he says that till he is settles who will ever give him their daughter and that he can't willingly ruin someone's life by being like this, by making promises that he probably can't fulfill. 

He then goes on to say that he hasn't shared all these things with anyone except me. That he wasn't joking about his parents suspecting that he vapes, he indeed did vape at one point. He said he tries to keep himself busy to forget about all tension in his life. Then he goes on to say that he is heartily sorry and asked me to focus on studies and interviews and have a good career unlike him. And that if god wanted, he will marry me but until then take care and all that. He said he is deactivating his account and i have his whatsapp number in case i need him.

I started my period yesterday so my stomach already hurt but now it was churning with anxiety with a sharp pain in my chest. I went to washroom like 3-4 times the night. Almost breaking down every now and then. My blanket felt as heavy as the earth and my legs hurt.

Today i almost broke down so many times, my parents are worried if i am sick but what can i say. I smile, trying to cover the fact that i might break down into tears any instant. I wanna hug someone and let this pain ooze out through my eyes but unfortunately that is too much to ask for. He said if he didn't do this, he might as well get depressed and kept apologizing.  He said his friend warned him when he first asked me out, that if he wanted to do this, do not break my heart, and that he has failed on that too. 

My heart keep sinking every now and then, tears on the edges of my eyes but i wipe them off, hide the pain. I have no choice. I have never felt this vulnerable and heart broken. I don't think that he understands that i am going through full on anxiety, pain and heart break, that i cry all the time and i have borderline eating disorder. He probably just thinks i am a little mad and that's that. Sometimes i get this instinct to text his friend and beg him to please make him understand how my life is depleting like this. He could have just taken a bit slow. It's  like a slap on my face which i don't know what i did to deserve. 

I think there isn't much i can do to help this. All i can do i focus on my life and career and pray for his. I am going to pray for him to find peace. I pray for his career. I hope he will soon figure it out. He said he would hopefully soon figure it out. I hope he has the best fucking career ever for how much he is going through. I pray that we will find a way out of all this, and get the happy ending that my god has planned for us."
"So this girl, say Sanon, I have know her for a long time now. I was never attracted to her personality because I couldn't kind that spark, that kindness and cheerfulness that I find attractive in girls. But at some point, when I was low, she moved towards me. I was looking for emotional comfort and I have to admit that I started expecting for that from her. I was trying to be equally supportive. Then, you know how girls think, she realized that I had lot of emotional need and I was not as strong mentally and she started to use me for validation. How could I tell? I don't know. I did not feel sincerity and I felt like a backup option for her.

Cut to this year. I contacted her. I shouldn't have. There was no reason. But I did. And then she started playing that game again. And is still playing. That game of me validating her on her provocation. The first time I did, this time around, it was out of my own willingness. Still I could not feel any sincerity to move to a relationship from her. I really shouldn't have contacted. In a way I feel bad as well, because it was me who started the conversation. She did not ask for it. Not directly at least. So I definitely fucked up there. 

But, I can not continue making the same mistakes. I do not like her personality because I don't think she is a good person. Sometimes, I feel I judge people too harshly. But it is a feeling that I cannot let go. Man, sometimes I feel that I am the bad guy. I guess I have to plough ahead and try to be better person everyday. My past mistakes can not define me. I will be more careful about my words and action. The most difficult part is when you feel animosity from someone you trust. You have to be careful about that. I think it is true for any person. You do not talk about common stuffs deeply with people. You have let it out in your diary or people outside of that context, if you really have to, and with their permission.

Back to this girl. I made a mistake of contacting her and validating her, even if I was provoked. I should be more careful about that. What is done is done. I will move forward without shame and fear. I will be more focused and will show greater character. I should have some mantras with me all the time, for avoiding my common mistakes. Don't worry about it being a complete list because it is going to change. Just write down your issues and find mantras to avoid those and go through them regularly."
"My mind is messing itself up for always associating good things with bad memories. Take Queen for example. I try to expose myself to Queen's songs but the sadness I feel every now and then makes it impossible for me to enjoy their songs. It's not even their fault! It's just eccentric to think about it. 

I also didn't like the song Perfect by Ed Sheeran because of how my mind associated it with the rejection I dealt 3 years ago. But now, I enjoy it. I think it's romantic and cheesy.

I just hope my mind doesn't associate Queen anymore with my sadness. I just want to listen with it the fun way. If anyone is reading this, can you please suggest some moves to do so I can listen to my Mercury without the fear of getting sadness again?"
"[real] 12/29/20

Dear diary,

I’m going to start writing here because I have nowhere else to turn. I know this is the safest place for me to express myself right now and share my thoughts. I can’t write any of this down where DH might find it. But it’s getting too bottled up inside. I need this somewhere to remind myself that I’m not crazy. To remind myself what I’m striving towards. That while there are good times, the bad is right around the corner. How do I keep forgetting that this is a cycle when it’s been happening for a dozen years or so? Because the good times are sooooo good, it makes me want to forget about the bad. I trick myself into thinking we’ve turned a corner, that it’ll be smooth sailing from here on out. I’m always wrong. The combination of alcohol and your anger problems always come back. I’m so over feeling like your world for awhile, just to get made to feel so incredibly useless and not worthwhile in the least for weeks or months at a time. 

I try talking to you about our issues but you say I’m selfish and always just make it about me. The day before yesterday you kept putting me down. Of course you had already started drinking in the morning. By the afternoon, I let you know how bad your comments were making feel. I told you I would no longer be responding to those sorts of comments. That made you angry. The rest of the night you continued to berate me, saying you don’t trust in our relationship or in me. I tried talking things out, but you were too drunk and wouldn’t let me say anything. Any time I would ask you to tell me what was going on, you would say you didn’t want to talk. You would then make a snide comment a little while later, but still wouldn’t allow me to respond. This went on for hours until you finally passed out. Yesterday you didn’t seem to remember when you woke up, but you had sent some pretty mean text messages to me, so I’m sure that clued you in a bit. You were sweet during the day, neither of us bringing up the previous night. You started drinking in the late afternoon. By evening, you were pretty buzzed. You kept asking to kiss my boobs and if I would give you a blow job. I kept saying I wasn’t in the mood, you kept persisting. By nighttime, you were angry and trying to guilt trip me into having sex with you. You said I didn’t have to do any work, I could just lay there. That made me feel awesome. You came home during your lunch break today to grab your sandwich and asked if I wanted to have a quickie. Your car was still running so I thought you were joking. Apparently you weren’t. I mentioned that you had been kind of mean about me not eating sex the night before, to which you rolled your eyes and said, “oh god, whatever!” At least you still gave me a kiss goodbye before you headed back to work. I’m still rooting for us. You have so much good. Stop drinking. Work on your anger issues. You have two years, then I’ll be done with school and able to support myself."
"While reading others' submission on their realizations about what they truly want, I became a little pressured. To this point, I don't know if I'm doing this out of passion, or am I doing this for gaining recognition? I don't know. It's weird! I also don't know if this is really what I want.

It is funny too that our hearts and minds doesn't intertwine at such times. I read somewhere that ""life isn't a race"" and I know that. I just need to realize that. Knowing and realizing things, at some aspects, are wholly different."
"

I don’t know why I’m doing this... Maybe it’s an act of rebellion for having to be discreet...maybe I want to unload it with the safety net of anonymity so I can move on? 
I don’t know. 
I’m broken now. Looking for clarity...no...I’m trying to stop hurting...
Make it fucking stop!

Met her last year in October, before the world broke. Didn’t initially think much of the encounter  other than she was kinda cute, but then for days I couldn’t stop thinking about her for some reason.
I found a way to see her again and we hit it off. She was intelligent, soft spoken but insightful, engaging, really interesting too. I could tell she was a soulful person. 
She had a rabbit...

About a week in, I was fucking around, trying to find her buttons, saying dumb shit, to provoke a reaction and what she said in response to my juvenile bullshit, was like getting t-boned by benevolence and grace. Quite literally stopped me dead and then I was head over heels 

We were inseparable, we went everywhere together. I helped her move her mom from the suburbs to her downtown place, she came with me to purchase inventory. We went on walks, rode our bikes all summer She made me jap chae. The hard way. I made her every conceivable dish I could remember or google. 
The sex was fire...Fucking fire.
She walks around, having brought herself back from a terminal illness. This girl, every day, out-flexes a deadly autoimmune disease. 
Who wouldn’t fall for her? 

I’m remembering all these things now. Maybe it’s good but fuck if it don’t hurt.
I’m gonna trust the process. But this is heavy. I need a break. 
I’ll write more later."
"I have been under the weather for almost 2 months now. Well, actually, it is not 2 months. I'm overthinking too much, and there's a lot of factors contributing to it (guilt from the past wrongdoings + regrets from impulsively resigning from a good paying job because of cowardice + daily sadness). I don't know what to do anymore, but I have a few plans in mind for 2021. And i hope someone will hire me too.

I'm kind of going slightly mad, but I don't want to dwell in this sadness anymore."
"My throat's healed tremendously better, but it still feels like something is stuck in it. I'm getting worried, but I still think it's mucus from my GERD, if I even have it, that is. I need a proper diagnosis from a gastroenterologist, but booking an appointment with a specialist of that kind is going to take forever. And, unfortunately, I don't think my insurance is going to cover it all.

Speaking of insurance, they just sent me a copay. It wasn't much considering I have enough money to cover my ass, but if I keep going to these doctors, like I've said in previous entries, I'm going to burn a hole through my wallet. 

I'm not stupid. In America, healthcare doesn't come cheap, and each time I visit these experts, it's not for free. I need to be more careful the next time I book an appointment with another specialist. Even if I get a referral from my PCP--my *new* PCP--there's still a high chance they'll charge me at full price and not pay for the bill. Which, of course, means I'll have to pay the full load.

Yeah. God bless the American healthcare system.

Otherwise, I feel fine. I probably just need to wait and see what happens. Then again, if it truly is something insidious, it may become worse and I'll have to pay even more later down the line. Christ, I shouldn't have to gamble with my own health. This wouldn't be a problem if I was rich, but I have a higher chance getting struck by a meteor from another galaxy before I could get any amount of wealth.

I really shouldn't be thinking about this stuff too much. Even the physicians I've visited so far told me I shouldn't worry, especially at my age. Still, I don't think it hurts to be proactive and to have someone check me out to be on the safer side. But, like I said, safer means having the money to do it. There's a part of me tempted to go back on state-sponsored healthcare, but that's impossible. Once you make a certain income, it's prohibited, and I'm not about to go to prison in a desperate attempt at insurance fraud. Now I'm stuck with this private insurance company, and I don't have the ""deluxe"" plan. I got stuck with the ""simple"" one. Seriously, if something really bad happens to me, I'm fucked, financially speaking.

Well, whatever. It's a Friday night, so I should at least try to enjoy it before Christmas comes along. And with that, have a good night."
"I enjoy writing for myself and for others to get messages of what we need the most and this is another one of my personal intuitive messages I wanted to share and see what resonates with you.

I promise you

To keep you safe

"Nights like tonight are one of the times I wish we were closer. My mind is buzzing, but not coherently. There's just this never ending static, a soft hum at the back of my mind keeping me awake.

It's late here, but it's even later (earlier?) there. You've said if I need to talk I can wake you, but I'd rather not. I care too much for you, and you need your sleep. It can wait until our next call. 

You quiet my mind. I'm not sure how it happens but your presence melts all the noise away, and I end up feeling calm. When you're around it feels like I can conquer anything. 

I wrote your letter the other day, sent it off with your Christmas gift. T stayed nearby the entire time I wrote, for emotionally support. T was so happy that I hadn't ""started panicking yet"". Yet. What a bizarre word. It means so little and yet so much.

That's the buzzing keeping me up, but it's not panic I feel. Mild confusion, I guess. After T pointed it out I tried to induce the panic so I could shut it down sooner rather than later, but I can't seem to conjure it up. I think about panicking and then I go ""Why? Everything is going to be fine"". I think. I hope. My head is confused about why part of me is trying to induce panic, when there is none to be had.

What's the worst that could happen? Rejection, I guess. You either don't acknowledge the letter at all, or flat out tell me you're not interested. Rejection used to scare me. Don't get me wrong, it would hurt like a b****, but I know I would survive. I guess I'm not panicking because I don't expect it to be poorly received. While neither of us have made our intentions crystal clear, I think its safe to say we both know what direction we're heading in. I definitely don't expect anything crazy. In fact I don't expect anything at all, really. Maybe a ""it was a very lovely letter"", if you choose to acknowledge it.

I think that's why I'm not panicking. You are so... kind. Caring. Compassionate. You are my rock. I haven't felt so at peace with life in a very long time, especially not while having feelings like these. I think I'm more excited than anything. I can't wait for you to get your letter and gift, I really hope you love it. I was nervous about it at first, but I think you'll really like it. 

I wanted to tell you that I'm excited to get yours as well, but I don't want to make you feel nervous. You've expressed your anxiety at making a poor choice. I don’t think you believed me when I told you that I would love anything you chose, because it means you were thinking of me. It is entirely true. I have no need or want for fancy things or expensive items, I just like knowing I'm on your mind, that I occupy a little space in your brain, even if for a brief amount of time. Its only been a couple days but I miss your voice. 

I'm annoyed that I can't sleep right now because I want to get up early and make sure I get everything done right away so we have plenty of time to call and chat. I'm kind of hoping that getting it all out will help. I guess we'll see.

I said it in the letter but it rings so true. When I look at you I see the future. It's bright, sunshiney, and full of love and happiness. I don't know what else it holds for us, but God, I am SO excited to find out. I love you, S."
"Happy Saturday from the guy whose got nothing imaginative to do. Ugh. I don't want to go back to work on Monday, and since I have to do so many damn things, it's going to be even worse. Bleh. 

There was absolutely nothing to do today. It was raining all day, and it is still is at night, just as I type this entry. It doesn't matter, anyway. Even if I did go out, there'd be little places to go, and I've not the energy for it. 

The state government is planning on moving into Phase 3 on Monday, which is after tomorrow. They're lessening the restrictions that have been put into place so far with Phase 2. And, the good news is that we're receiving the vaccines by the next coming weeks. I will be receiving it after the clinicians and at-risk patients do. As it stands, they're making it voluntary, but I choose to do it. I trust the companies who made this, and the FDA who approved it, enough.

I did hear some of the rather nastier adverse effects in certain people. One of them was a temporary stroke-like symptom of the face. Otherwise, I haven't heard anyone dropping dead from it. Good enough for me, honestly. There's always risk associated with these kinds of things, though vaccines do take the longest to develop for good reasons. Still, it's better than being naked in this pandemic, even with the face masks.

If anything, it'll protect me from the droves of idiots who still refuse to wear one, or the ones who do wear them but not appropriately. 

From what I understand, the vaccine is to be given in two doses. The needles are also meant to be driven intramuscularly, meaning that the person giving the shot has to puncture past the skin's layers all the way down to the muscle. Those types of shots hurt like hell, but a few moments and some soreness in the weeks after pale in comparison in getting the actual disease from the virus.

In other news, there was a shooting in my town. Yup. According to the police so far, over 20 rounds were fired from a gun, probably a pistol. One guy got hit and is on his way to the hospital in stable condition. They haven't caught the person responsible yet.

The shooting happened at a bar that I know of. Honestly, I don't like going to pubs. They usually tend to attract the more seedy customers, though that's highly dependent on where the pub is located and what kind of clientele generally haunt there. Rule of thumb is this: the shittier the neighborhood, the shittier the customers. Of course, now I'm making assumptions. In any case, I don't drink, and I don't do bars unless I'm eating by myself.

Whatever. They'll most likely catch the party responsible, especially after firing over 20 rounds, and on a Saturday night, no less. Even with this pandemic, there have been more and more people going out, though I believe it's still restricted to drink and eat at the bars.

I don't want to talk about or think about work. All I'll say is that the boss was extremely happy with my data analysis I did on Thursday. Even if they are preliminary results, he was pleased with what he saw. He wants me to continue doing this, but with the amount of stuff being piled up on me, it's going to be more and more difficult. That's all I'll say about work.

I went to the ENT on Thursday. The NP there said I looked fine and that there was nothing to worry about. I hope so. I've been feeling much better, though I should keep an eye on my health as much as possible. 

I feel tired and restless at the same time. I don't want this Saturday to end."
"Throughout my adolescence, I have always been terrified of adulthood. My mother has made it a very scary place. But I had always have time to procrastinate thinking about it. Now it’s too late because I’m an adult now and I’m so so lost.

I’m a horrible human being. I have been contemplating about the s word lately. 

I feel like that’s the only option I have. 

I feel so useless and hopeless. I feel like like a crazy person. If I can’t change the outcome, why make me go through all of the humiliation. 

This morning while going to job that’s I’m still on probation, I had to stop on the way and cry. I know I’m about to get fired. I don’t blame them though. They’re all so nice and helpful. I’m just so fucking useless. 

I thought after all that happened, I would hate my mother most. I blame everything on her after all. But at the end, it’s just me. The only person I can’t stand is myself. 

I made so many mistakes, so many wrong decisions. 

If I try, maybe I can fix them. But I’m so tired. I have no support system, no more fuel or will left in me. I feel like a single grass trying to survive on the desert and I’m just wilting away day after day. 

I tried the ‘just one more day’ method. But every day is filled with pain. And I don’t even know what’s waiting on the other side. I tried. But it’s just not enough. 

This is it, I guess. 

I’m sorry if this violates any rule, I couldn’t post on r/suicidewatch and I need a place to vent."
"It's finals week. While the others are struggling to push themselves to study, I actually quite enjoy the stuff that I'm studying. I decided to follow my interests and major in history, and I absolutely love studying it. But I can't help but think of how I can no longer enjoy the joy of learning after I graduate. I don't think I'm passionate enough or determined enough to enter academia or do research, so I'm quite certain I'll enter the job market instead of continuing my studies. But from what I heard from others, the working world is a living hell. There is no personal time, every day is work eat sleep repeat, and in the place that I live in, over time work is the norm, working on weekends is also pretty common. And thinking of this sucks the soul out of me, it makes me so hopeless. I could be happily studying my history stuff and this thought pops into my mind, reminding me of the hell hole waiting for me once I graduate, and I instantly get sad. And it sucks because I know I should focus on the happiness that studying brings me, and treasure it before it ends, but the thought of a future without time to fullfil my hobbies leaves me frustrated every time and I cannot focus on my studies. I have been thinking all day (it's been lingering in my mind for a whole year actually) on how to maintain my hobbies when I have a full time job, but I am yet to find a resolution. It just doesn't seem feasible when one is working 10 hours a day, working such long hours would kill any passion that I have. Last time I worked as an intern I didn't even want to eat dinner, I just wanted to do my own thing. But I can't really see any way around this, I need the money. I want to make enough money so that I can sustain my hobbies, that's why I want a stable job so badly, I need it to feed my hobbies. I want to go diving and travelling.

At dinner I was just talking to my parents about how my teacher got to travel to the North Pole for her holidays, I thought it was really cool. I actually would like to go there some day, but thinking of the horrid working hours and the student loans, it feels like I'll never get the chance to go there. I feel like by the time I gain enough money, my soul would be so tired from all the work, I would have no more hobbies or passion. I teared up thinking about it.

I know I am whining but I'm just trying really hard to get over the fact that I won't have a life once I graduate, and this remaining semester would be the last bit of happiness I can hold on to."
"So Today I got rejected from my last job opening/interview I was waiting on. After applying for over one hundred different graduate schemes I am now thoroughly exhausted. The blow was so huge I felt like throwing up for ages, but I didn't, I just let the numbness take over. I lay on my bed thinking about my life, thinking about how my parents had invested so much in me and how I was going in any direction particularly fast at all. I have worked hard but its not enough during this pandemic and it has got me down. I do not want to embarrass them by being that ""unemployed kid that lives in their parents basement"". They have worked so hard and I want to give back. I let the sadness of my 80th rejection settle in for a bit then decided that if I was gonna go anywhere I was gonna have to write my goals down. (For context I am a final year Uni student at a decent university) This is what I decided where the most important things to me to complete in my life for myself:

1. Pay back all the money my parents spent on my education
2. Compete in a sport to represent my country (I have trained with the olympic squad but never performed at an international level
3. Learn Chinese
4. Stop watching Porn
5. Stop watching Youtube
6. Do an Ironman
7. Join the military in some form
8. Get a 2:1 in my degree (3.4 GPA for you americans ;))
9. Buy a house
10. Play guitar in a concert

I wrote these all down on a sheet of paper, that I vow to keep with me now at all times. I have got close to all of these (apart from the first one) and I have decided I am going to do all them, no matter what. For some more context I am massively addicted to porn and youtube (4 hours a day) and it needs to stop. I have done a half ironman, did cadets as a kid, play guitar a few times a week and have a GCSE in Chinese. I want to complete all of these, and will post on here updates on my progress. At the moment I am really trying to ramp up my training, do well in my studies and get a job. I am trying to apply to as many as I can but the job market is not looking so great at the moment. I hope someone can relate to this. The no porn and youtube streak starts now! BTW I am 21.

Hope you are all doing fantastically!

Gaz"
"As the title of the entry states, I'm in a much better mood, and with that, a much better feeling. I'm not 100% all there, but it's much, *much* better than the last two weeks of what I'd described as a monotonous feeling. I don't want to get too much into the medical stuff, because I'm too exasperated to talk about it. Really, it's too much sometimes.

The city was pretty much dead tonight. I did walk around and try to get a load of hardware out of my head, but even so, it kept bugging me. I went to eat and thought maybe food could alleviate the noise, but it didn't really help. I lost my appetite, and it's not because of me recovering from my sick feeling. 

It feels tiresome to be going through these routines over and over again. I can't wait to spend another year and then leave immediately for another job. I did get a raise (finally!), but it was piss poor compared to what others are making right now. 

Yeah, so...so much for that better mood, then.

There've been more tourists visiting the city, though it absolutely pales in comparison to pre-COVID days. Still, I suppose it makes for a much better mood, and no, I'm not talking about myself. The atmosphere of the surroundings feels much more sullen because of the pandemic, and now with winter beginning, it's going to be even more so. I think so, anyway.

Wow. Aren't I just a ball of sunshine? Listen, I am trying to keep positive as possible, but whenever I start typing out on here, it gets to me. These negative feelings? They have to pour out onto this medium.

I haven't been exercising much. Actually, truthfully, I haven't really at all. It's a dreadful and dangerous habit, especially as I get older. A doctor once told me that sitting is the new smoking, and now I'm starting to believe him. 

Shit, this isn't good. My muscles are going to start wasting away. For real: even something as small as a nudge is going to bruise me if I don't start working out again.

I really don't know what else to talk about. That seem to be a running theme with these entries nowadays. I'm only hoping for all of this to go away, but hope itself is not going to do anything. I'm a scientist, and as a scientist, I strongly depend on rationality and results from data that's been analyzed from months to years of experimentation, and what it could yield to benefit humanity. With that being said, I'm banking on these vaccines to work.

Please, let this be over already. I want things to go back to normal. Seriously, I wouldn't even mind the snarled, rush hour traffic jams we had over here during the days before the pandemic. Just *anything* to go back to our semblance of normalcy.

Deaths are starting to rise up again at the hospital I work at. Obviously, it's not as high as it was back in March and April, but it surprised those that thought it was all over. 

Well, for anyone reading this and had any doubts in their mind, it's not over yet. I do believe we are close, but as a scientist, I cannot be confident enough to say with 100% certainty. As another scientist once put it, I am remaining cautiously optimistic. On top of that, I'm not an expert on this stuff. Not by a long shot. Virology, epidemiology, and most facets of medicine are not my specialty. If you want bonafide advice, I'd strongly suggest listening to the experts who know what they're talking about, even if this process continues to develop--and it *will* continue to develop, even long after this pandemic is officially over.

 I'm still seeing videos of these imbeciles going to places where face masks are required and behaving belligerently towards the employees and/or customers. Sometimes, they get arrested and are trespassed from the property for good. I would say I'll never understand those people, but I think it's fair to keep it concise and state the obvious: these people do not like being told what to do. Among other reasons, certainly. Ignorance and pseudo-intellectualism knows no bounds, and the amount of misinformation in regards to the pandemic and the efforts taken to keep the public safe, it's just so exhaustingly stupid.

I do not envy any of these workers putting up with these people's bullshit. I don't have tolerance for that at all.

I need to keep these entries shorter. These are starting to become more worrying, ruminating thoughts."
"I don't want to be a burden on my family so I've stopped talking about how I feel with them. I know I'm a disappointment, I know I'm a burden, and with the mental illness I have I'm not ever going to get better.

I thought I was getting better. I really did. Big, strong older sister capable of taking care of everything asked of me. But then the stress started getting to me. I've lost my appetite. I have become lethargic with depression and my mind has gone to dark places again.

I don't want to talk to them. I don't want to look like I'm looking for attention. I feel lost."
"I'm getting better with each day, I think. I still need a doctor to check me out, and while I may know what the issue is, a medical professional's examination and expertise will always be invaluable. And, you know, I can't ""self-diagnose"". 

With that being said, I have a new coworker to train. This lady's been fantastic. She's extremely energetic and bubbly to work with. I'm confident already she'll make an excellent scientist and an even better manager of the lab once I'm gone. Of course, it's not only her personality that I enjoy, but her ability to grasp and remember things. For me, I have and have always had trouble recalling things. I work better when I talk out loud or write things down. Her? She hasn't been taking any notes and yet she can remember practically everything I told her days before. I reckon she'll be much more efficient at this job than me!

The Professor was wise in choosing her. With another scientist whose ability so far has proven to be more than proficient, we'll be up and running this lab back to its regular scheduling in no time. Speaking which, we're looking into another candidate. We actually did interview someone about two weeks ago, but apparently, the Doctor didn't like him. When I asked her why, she said he gave off a ""condescending and rude attitude"". I have no idea what he said to her that made her upset, but I didn't find him to be trouble at all. In fact, I found him to be amicable.

Well, that is the whole point of the interview process, but I think selecting a candidate goes much more smoothly if there's a general positive consensus about them. Still, regardless of what the Doctor believes, it'll be the Professor to decide if he wants to hire him, in the end. Honestly, I'm just glad we got *somebody* on board, because if we didn't hire anyone by the time we reached December, we would've been in really deep shit.

The Doctor's been on vacation and will be back on Tuesday. I don't know where she went off to, but hopefully she's safe. Cases are beginning to rise around the country, and it's very likely we'll be going back to Phase 2 over here. A lot of service workers are going to be especially hurt by this, considering there'll be time restrictions put on these businesses on when and how they can operate. 

Everybody seems to be banking on this vaccine, but we'll still have to wear masks and social distance until a majority of the population has built immunity to this virus.

Oh, and also, it finally happened around here. Someone got into a fight with another person because they refused to wear their facemask. I didn't see the incident, but it happened locally, near where I live. Long story short, a guy was asked to wear a mask while riding on the bus. The operator asked him several times to don a mask, the guy didn't want to, and when the operator pulled the bus over and told him to get off or he'd call the cops, the guy punched the operator in the face. Not only did the assailant punch the driver in the face, he also picked up a chalk block--an object used to hold the bus in place when it's parked so it doesn't roll forwards or backwards--and clonked the poor driver in the head.

The driver was no punk, though. He charged after his assailant, restrained him, and somebody, I assume, called the cops and they arrived and arrested him. All over not wearing a facemask. And just to add insult to injury, the guy already had a warrant out for his arrest for a previous assault and battery. What an idiot. I hope it was worth all the rage, kid. He's probably looking at a myriad of other charges if anything, medically speaking, should happen to the driver afterwards. Those chalk blocks are made out of solid wood, so getting clobbered in the head with them will really smart.

You know, I was saying how proud I was in that the majority of the community here were following COVID-19 safety guidelines and orders. Now, however, after hearing about this incident, I have to wonder how many of these have been happening around here. I've seen plenty of videos of these dumbasses walking into stores, refusing to wear a facemask, and then putting on a loud song and dance before they either get ejected by the police or arrested by them. As I type these words, some poor bastard who's making less than peanuts is dealing with a bombastic, ignorant blowhard who's going off about how they don't have to wear a mask.

Which reminds me: the governor is implementing citations (fines) to riders on public transit who refuse to wear a facemask. Finally, honestly, it's about damn time. I'm sure it'll most likely end up like the story above, however, because knowing these idiots, they're looking to start shit. 

Bah, I have no time for these idiots. 

Right. So, with that being said, I'm off for tomorrow's workday.

Goodnight."
"The Doctor checked my throat and back today, and to my relief, she told me it wasn't cancer. She actually laughed, thinking that's what I'd jump to. I guess a lot of patients do.

Shame on me, really. You know, I work in the biomedical field and I'm always telling people not to panic and to think of the most common explanation when it comes to illnesses. And yet here I am, thinking that the first funny feeling my in throat and its general area is cancer. I'm not practicing what I preach.

Thankfully it's nothing, but I still feel like going to an ENT wouldn't hurt. Then again, maybe I don't want to know. Bah, I'll figure it out later.

The new candidate--no, new *coworker* came in today. I showed her the ropes and crammed as much info I could into her. I'm not trying to overwhelm her but the faster we can train her, the better help we'll be able to retain from the recent turnovers. At least, I hope she stays for a while.

Yeah, as I've said before, academia has a medium to high turnover rate, and it's mainly not because of bad management or coworkers or P.I.s (though it can), but because of low pay with too many responsibilities. That's always a big worry for any P.I. of a lab: as soon as a qualified candidate comes in and learns a majority of the things they need for a year, they bail, and sometimes without a 2-week notice.

This is why you'll almost always see a ""2-year minimum"" requirement for these labs, because they know. They know you don't really want to be here, but you need the experience and money to move onto bigger and better things.

Anyway, there was something else. Mr. E dying from his complications got me really thinking about the effects of cigarette smoke. It especially got me thinking about addiction and how it can be controlled, treated or even cured. Addiction's not an easy thing to kick away from. Any addiction, really, you could argue isn't easy to just drop right then and there. 

It's funny that I'm here with this lab. I actually wanted to study cancer from a genetic point of view, but I somehow ended up with this. Not that I'm complaining (too much), but I never thought myself being into pulmonary biomedical research.

And speaking of cigarette smoking, I've been trying to get my friend to quit for a while. I mean, a *long* while. He's been smoking again in higher frequency, though he did slow down a few years ago. It doesn't matter. One of those death sticks is enough for your body. He started smoking when he was only 12-years old and has been on that habit ever since. Among a myriad of other drugs he's taken, he hasn't stopped smoking and I don't think he ever will.

Miraculously, he hasn't gotten any types of cancers, but I think cancers are the least of his worries. Not being able to breathe should be his biggest concern at this point, but he's in his late 20's now, so maybe there's still time before he gets better. I just hope it's sooner than later, because once he gets into his 40's, it's going to be extremely difficult to get better.

Still, what did I say before? It's never too late, but there are nuances, I understand that. Regardless, the benefits in not continuing this awful habit are tremendous compared to the alternatives.

My head still feels a fuzzy a bit, so I definitely think I should go see that specialist soon. But, soon won't be coming soon, because I need to train this girl and at the same time, I need to perform my own lab duties.

This sucks."
"This instrument we have in the lab is a piece of shit. Seriously, it's always something with this damned thing. It's an old, rickety thing that's barely on life-support. Every time I have to operate it, it decides when *it* wants to work. Some days it says yes, some days it says no. Today, it said no. And it wasn't a simple no, it was a hard ""go fuck yourself"" no. I did manage to fix the issue, but, god, what a timewaster. I'd rather get my teeth pulled out. Really, I mean that.

I feel like a mechanic more than a scientist. At this point, I'm about to put that on my resume. I can see it now: ""Constantly had to troubleshoot garbage-ass machine that was most likely sentient and hated everything, including its own existence."" 

I honestly feel like I'm back working at the repair shop I used to help manage. The only difference is that cars are much easier to diagnose and repair than this sack of shit.

Yeah, I normally don't cuss as much in my entries, but I was not feeling it tonight, and it being a Friday, no less, I just wanted to go home as soon as possible. Even worse, I get the Saturday shift tomorrow. **AND GUESS WHICH INSTRUMENT I GET TO PLAY WITH TOMORROW?** Yup! The very same one I keep ranting on about!

Even the Professor knows that this thing sucks so bad, he doesn't even want to come near it--and he's the P.I.! This is *his* machine! He knows it's slowly dying, but we sadly don't have enough grant money to replace it. I have done homework into looking for newer, better, much more efficient and ""cleaner"" machines, but they're ridiculously expensive. The best one on the market costs about $150,000, and that's not including service installation and shipping and handling costs, among other fees, I'm sure.

One of our collaborators does have tons of money, but they wouldn't dare part with that kind of money to buy another instrument. Besides, setting it up and removing the old one would take way, way too damn long. In the end, it isn't worth the headache. I'm just better off, albeit grudgingly, maintaining this thing.

God, I feel tired, but at the same time, not so tired. I guess I'm amped about this thing giving me a hard time...among other matters.

Oh, and also, I said my farewells to my coworker today. He's leaving, but I'm certain I'll be seeing him around the area. He also said he'd stay in contact with me, so it's not a permanent goodbye.

I was never good with goodbyes, anyway. I just tell people, ""See you later"". Frankly, I get too emotional with goodbyes, unless the person or party I'm saying goodbye to are pricks.

So, with that all being said, see you later!"
"Sometimes I have those days when I feel like I'm doing everything wrong. Like it's not my day. You need to read this when you feel like you're not doing enough. Or when you're having a bad day. Doing your best is already more than enough. Trying and doing your best is good enough. Don't feel down over something so small. Once you start thinking about it that's when your thoughts starts swallowing you over. You need to relax, breathe, and know you're doing your best. I don't know why you might feel the way you do when it comes to that. If the people around you make you feel bad, don't mind them. You are doing your best with what you can, and that is appreciated, that is more than enough. I struggle a alot sometimes in certain situations with this. I hope to remember these kind words in my time of need. I hope these words can soothe your heart today.

"I was a with a friend yesterday. His father passed away from Covid. I was not feeling particularly sentimental about that but I could understand his pain. I am not sure if I will feel much if my own father passed away. He is not perfect but he did a lot of things for me. At least in terms of money and resources. I guess he was dealing with his insecurities and problems. My mom, well she shows lot of love. But underestimated me all my life. And used me all my life to get attention from her peers. So none of them are perfect. If I ever succeeded at anything they feel proud but at the same never did anything to bring me there. I had to fight with mediocrity myself. I never got any confidence from them only remarks about what I was doing wrong. In the worst possible way as well. As if I was not even capable of doing anything substantial.   

I used to feel emotional just with the thought of their pain when I was younger. I wanted to run away from home when I was very young, even thought of dying. But would get very emotional about the pain they will feel. Again, they are not perfect but they are not monsters as well. They were insecure and projected a lot of that on me. On the one hand I sympathize with them, while on the other I don't have any particular respect for them as well. 

When I went to see off my friend yesterday, he hugged me before leaving. I felt a bit emotional then. I thought that I had buried all my emotions and was not even capable of feeling them now. But I did feel a little. It kind of made me a bit good about myself. I used to be one of those guys who would be open about his feelings and never afraid of showing his true emotions even if it made him feel weak. But as it let to many failures in my life, and I forced myself to speak less about them and in the process started feeling less and less. I did not have a good sense of what is the normal way of showing emotion. Because I did not learn it while growing up. 

Now at this stage of my life I am feeling more stable in terms of emotion. I struggled a lot with depressive thoughts last few years. But thanks to some of the people in my life I managed to address them on my own. But I think I still have lot of insecurities. I do not feel confident about a lot of things. I doubt myself too much. I find it really hard to handle criticism and am very defensive. I tend to break off relation based on single mistakes. I desire absolute friendship or none at all. This is where I am at. I guess I am still finding an identity that can relate to people while maintaining it's independence. It is a recent revelation. I am trying to move forward with my gut feeling in the face of all the self and external doubts and all the pressure related to them. 

This life is short. Like a day. It is not possible to do everything in a day nor in this life. I would like to fill the day with things that makes me feel good and fulfilled. I have to know what makes me feel better. A deserving goal and a certain number of steps toward them. Not acting like an asshole that is behavior that is guilt free. Courage in the face of adversity. Standing up for myself and for the things that I feel is right. That is all. Nothing more."
"Dear Reddit diary,

I should be used to it already, and to some measure I think I am, but sometimes I get reminded very harshly of this fact: my life is always going down the drain and I am unable to do anything about it. The thing that reminded me of this painful truth is my university assignment, which I didn't even start writing. My colleagues started working on this assignment like three weeks ago, and I arrived in today's online class without knowing even what's supposed to be done in it. Nor did I do the reading for this day. Those things, put together, made me feel extremely ashamed, and I was reluctant even to show up in said online class... but I forced myself not to be a pansy and stay. Professor wasn't a dick about it, at least.

The other courses are more or less in the same situation: I barely show up for the classes, I pretty much don't read anything for them and then assignments are piling up like crazy. And what shocks me the most is that I don't behave like this because say, I'm busy with work, children or whatnot. In fact, I'm almost a NEET. I don't do the assignments because I can't even start doing them. I spend my days browsing the web randomly, reading random things and watching videos, and I wished to do otherwise, but I simply CAN'T. 

The thing that really makes me feel depressed is that I'm really broke. Things are falling apart around me, and this fucking pandemic made the financial strain I always faced get way worse. People would think that seeing this state of things would make me motivated to actually do something about it but... no. Sometimes I can't sleep at night, seeing that if things stay this way, everything will just get worse. It's fucking hell.

Not doing particularly better in the other spheres of life too, as my brief Reddit experience is showing me already: my social/language skills make it difficult for people to actually be interested in responding to my messages, and my looks simply make it worse regarding women. There are some times in my life in which I feel, if not happy, at least neutral and indifferent to those things. There are even some times I manage to get stuff done. But this is not such a time.

Oh well. Wish I had better things to journal about, but I don't. Wish I was a better writer too, but I'm not. That's it."
"Just finish watching another french movie: la reine des pommes - started with Adele, interpreted by Valérie Donzelli going through the end of a ""toxic"" relationship and slowly shows the evolution through the different men she meets to liberate herself from the dependant relationships she passes through .. I love how french films are non-judgy without a moral perspective behind - it goes above most of Hollywood plots where the right/good action gets compensated and the incorrect/bad gets punished - which also has its kind of magic , but there is a more compasionate point of view through the french film glasses as well as more human as we all had experience all these ranges of feelings . Film has a lot of sexual innuendos and short dialogues between the main character and her different encounters as well as with her cousin that takes her over her place that has a story on her own and her own redemption process through the oposite path somehow ( she learns to trust more and let herself go more as well as to depend more and accept herself loving her own ""defects"") , lots of sexual encounters but somehow necessary for the plot . The surprising part was to find out at the very end after googling the film's reviews that the main male characters were played by the same actor : Jérémie Elkaïm- he does an excellent job adapting to each character impecably"
"The street musicians come out to rummage this city at dusk. I know the tune of their song by heart by now. It repeats every day, the same part melancholic part playful sounds. They ask for a few coins or whatever you have left in the pantry for their children to eat. Their sounds a requiem for this city's poorest, their most vulnerable, the perpetually forgotten. Those who perform for our pity and our entertainment, their craft used to be so much more cheerful and more dignified, now it is a dying cry. I slip past The Lady sometimes and give them tuna cans and bread. I've come to the conclusion that charity is just a way to tell ourselves that we are above those we help. If we are in a position to do something for them, it means we are OK, aren't we?

And while the poor will suffer,  he rest will not be able to climb to success like capitalism dictates we should. My aunts and uncles worry that their children might have to suffer the indignity of not being rich.

The ceiling over my desk is populated by spiders, I've made my peace with them as they eat the mosquitos and probably aren't poisonous. Plus, my current Buddhist philosophy regarding that every creature deserves the right to live no matter how terrifying I find them has made me unable to kill them. The Lady is going to flip if she sees them.

Yours truly,

Agatha"
"It's been a month today since you left. To say it's been hard is an understatement. You were officially my son-in-law for only a handful of months but you called me Mom from the first night I met you. B (your wife) went into a horribly scary downward spiral after the morning she found you in the parking lot of the church sitting in your car unresponsive and cold. I still remember the sound of her dad's voice at 700 on that Sunday morning. Although you two weren't to impressed with the other his heart was breaking for his little girl. We knew this was definitely going to change her forever.
The last time i saw you was at the scene while the police investigated. From where I was standing you looked like you were asleep. But you weren't. 
They found the gun on passenger seat which was odd for someone who had taken their life. To me meant that you didn't go instantly. It took a minute or two. You were looking at the picture of B you kept on your dash. 

I still get anxious and overwhelmingly sad when I go past the church where you were found. I used to be able to mindlessly drive to the apartment you shared with my daughter and my two beautiful grandbabies. Now it seems I'm hyper-aware of turning down that street. I'm instantly back to that morning, standing outside of the police tape looking at you in your car. 

I met your mother, father, step father and brother a little over 48 hours after you were found. I completely understood why you were so drawn to me and my family within the first 5 minutes. You had finally known what it meant to be part of a loving, supportive family. We had our issues, we had our arguments and would distance ourselves at times but we never walked away. In the 29 years you were on this earth, I was the only person who had ever been upset with you but not verbally abuse, scream at or threaten you. You always knew that even if I was upset with you about one of the many issues there were in your relationship with my daughter and the drinking, that in a few days I'd be there to talk to you about my concerns. I did see you try to do and be better. I think it just got to be too much for you. 

At almost 3 years old, C talks about you often. He says he sees you a lot. It wasnt long after you were gone he fell asleep holding your picture. L, suddenly began waking up in the middle of the night laughing and jumping in her crib, whereas before she would immediately cry if she woke up. 

A lot of songs I hear have a new meaning to me now and I find myself tearing up at random times during the day when something I see or hear reminds me of you. 

I've got the pictures you emailed up in the living room. C likes to look at them when he's over. 

It's cold, rainy and gray outside this morning, it seems fitting. 

No one is sure why you made the decisions you made that night. I guess we never will. I know you're finally at peace though. And I know you're still with B and the kids, which is the only place you wanted to be. 

I don't know how her story ends, I just know that in that one instant her life was forever changed, as was mine and many others. I've never lost someone so close to me in such a sad and tragic way. I think the fact that you are the one who took yourself away is the hardest to cope with. You didn't have a terminal physical disease, there was no accident. You were the who pulled the trigger that night. In my heart I think you did it in the most compassionate way possible and all the little things that happened since tells me you did what you felt you had to do. But you're not going anywhere. 

I know you're at peace now. I wanted to put a candle in the church parking lot for you tonight but I don't think I can go into that parking lot just yet. I can barely drive passed it. Eventually, maybe I can but not yet."
"For four years we fought the battle that is our lives, the fight for our future! And in that fourth year, we crossed paths and our lives converged.

Souls purging the fire as the battle drums beat, crows looking expectingly perched on the protruding branch of a badly burned evergreen tree. The battleground had been claimed, and the plans had been made. We began as strangers, astray and on separate paths. Then, the sun rose after a 20 year-long dusk and our fates collided like a battering ram and catapult into the silver stone fortress of the enemy. Yet, we were side by side all throughout that year. Flesh and steel ready to dive into the unknown terrain, with the courage of an entire pride of wild lions. The tamers were asleep. The roar of 1000 lions echoed throughout the caverns, as the legions assembled. There we were, ready, breathing heavy but steady. Blood may have been spilt and tears may have fallen. However, ours are dried by our smiles. We overcame the worst of the worlds struggles, and the end of the dark nights loom near.

We both arose from the gloom and found each other. There we were! A true friend, with the souls of lovers. The battle of our 4 year degree will end in the final stand come November 15th. Exam day. We could not be any more that friends, even though we would have been perfect. But you love me and I you, and I wish you the best. You are more than just a friend, but of course we are unable to admit that.

The papers at my desk are scattered, my mind is tired. The workload has piled up. I have been unable to talk and be around you as much as I would have liked and even if I wasn't so busy, you are happily taken. So it seems as if our road is coming to an end. We have been through the battles of study together and have become good friends. Where one road ends, another one opens. The nerves of our initial encounters has been tamed and the fire calmed to a more gentle simmer.

Impossible odds, we conquered. Impossible missions, we accomplished. We did that together.

Where will our paths lead next? Where will you and I be in the next 5 years. An age of peace shall be upon us, and perhaps we could take on life in not so chaotic and frantic times. Or perhaps we are to return to strangers.

You know I appreciate you. Even if all we can be are friends.

Love knows no bounds."
"This is bad. My coworker has gone on vacation for about a week. It's not something we can't handle, but now we're down three scientists. If we weren't already understaffed, you could say we're *dramatically* understaffed. Now I have to take even more responsibilities while he's gone. But, like I said, it's nothing that I can't handle. Goddamn, though, this is gonna be a rough week ahead of us.

We're finally hiring another scientist, speaking of which. She'll have to go through the onboarding process and myriad of paperwork, but once she arrives, we'll train her and have her become a bonafide investigator in no time. Until then, we're on our own...more like, I'm on my own.

The data we acquired needs to be analyzed. So far, it's just raw data sitting on my computer's hard drive, but I'll find time to get to it eventually. The Professor isn't too impatient about it, but he is anticipating in utilizing that instrument in the near future with another (ridiculously expensive) assay kit. I've a feeling he'll bug me about it sometime tomorrow or next week. He wants the averages of each group of specimens, including their associated P-values, and to make graphs for each group.

There's another collaborator that I haven't been responding to as much as I should be. We promised to give him two vials of these specimens stored away in our liquid nitrogen tanks, but I haven't kept that promise. I've been piss-poor in communications with him, though my boss is telling me to prioritize other tasks, so if this guy starts getting upset with me, he can take it up with the Professor. The last thing I need is another physician-scientist shooting their mouth off at me, and I'm not in the mood in taking any chew-outs from anybody.

With each passing day, I'm thinking more and more of what I'll be doing beyond this job. There's this one company I'm heavily interested in working for, but the last time I checked their positions, I was way overqualified for it. Not like I'm trying to put myself on a pedestal, but when I say ""overqualified"", it simply means that my education and experience level would not be beneficial from a business standpoint to hire me for those specific positions. Then again, what the hell do I have to lose?

Hah. Here I am, talking about all this high-powered bullshit, and in the meantime there's still an ongoing global pandemic. Who the hell am I kidding? Until this whole situation gets better, I think it's going to be extremely difficult for me to relocate to another job.

Only one way to find out."
"Just some things to jot down in this entry before I head off to bed.

One of my neighbors has been complaining of a rotten smell coming somewhere from between his basement and kitchen. He asked me to come over real quick to investigate, because I guess he wanted a second opinion, telling me that his wife thinks he's crazy. Well, I did go over and there was indeed a faint smell of rotten something, but I seriously doubt it's anything serious. If it's originating from the basement, it's most likely mold, and when the temperature changes it's probably affecting the potency of the smell. 

At least, that's my theory. What else could it be? He did originally believe it was coming from a carcass of an animal, but we couldn't find anything like that. Also, the smell wasn't as bad as he thought it was. I'm confident anyone would be able to tell the difference between what is most likely mold buildup versus a rotting corpse of an animal. Anyway, I recommended he uses a dehumidifier from now on, though the basement didn't feel as humid as I thought it would be. 

I'm not a believer in it, but I've read that a rotting smell of unknown origin means that there is a demonic presence about. I know people do believe in that stuff and take it very seriously, but there's always an easier explanation. I suppose it's appropriate to talk about this during October, but like I said, I don't believe in it.

In other news, I finally got the damned instrument in my lab to work. Now, I should be more excited than usual, but honestly, it was a headache getting that piece of shit to run. It took nearly 3 days of me   overworking myself to the bone to get it running, and that's a special thanks to my coworkers who helped me out. 

I won't bore you with the technical details, unless you're interested, but essentially it's an instrument that measures a specific type of proteins called cytokines. I did briefly talk about this before in previous entries, but I'll give the quick rundown. You take a sample, such as plasma or blood, and after processing it appropriately, you measure the total protein in it. This is performed via an assay (test) called BCA. You read the amount on a plate (96-well plate) and see how much total protein you have in the sample using a plate reader. You then calculate via software on how much sample you need to take in order to use it in the final assay for cytokine measurement. This is arguably the most important step. If the protein concentration is too high, it will overshoot the instrument's detection limit threshold. If the protein concentration is too low, it will not be read at all by the instrument, or at least at an extremely low, erroneous amount.

That's just the abridged version of how it works, and I know there are assay scientists out there that can explain it much better than I ever could.

God, getting all this stuff to work together was already a pain in the ass, but I can't imagine the pain and frustration in actually developing these assays. Though, I'm sure it pays damn well. Huh. Maybe it's something I'll do after this.

I got the Saturday shift this week again. I don't mind anymore, but maybe that's the issue. I feel almost melting into this routine. That's how it's supposed to go down, though, isn't it? Still, it feels weird. I don't feel like the calendar is a big deal anymore. Ugh, I already talked about this before so I won't repeat myself.

My parents' bird is sick, I think. Yeah, they have a parakeet. The little blue fluff ball is not looking too well. He's displaying listlessness and hasn't been flying or eating properly. Maybe he's just depressed. They're thinking of taking him to an avian vet, though I'm reluctant to hear what the possible diagnosis will be. He's been in the family for nearly, what, 15 years now. I think he's nearing the end of his life. As much as it pains me to say that, and if he's got some kind of debilitating disease, we may have to put him down. 

I don't like to think about losing something or someone dear to me. 

Well, I'll end it there. Hopefully things will get better, but I'm naïve to think otherwise, especially with what's been going on.

Goodnight, and good luck."
"I start to feel lonely ..one day it's so similar to the next; guess I am just waiting for my job to start so I can meet people there - I really hope I make at least one friend in this city ; if I were single at least I could meet people and have the illusion of a potential partner or something - but I reach to the point that I got lazy to meet new friends or new people . I don't know. 

I've watched two interesting movies today: ""l'affaire Dumont"" which is the story of a guy mistakenly accused of rape whose life gets completely destroyed because the lady accusing him confuse him with another one - I like how the film does not take any side but shows you also the vulnerability of the lady which truly went through a traumatic experience and you cannot really put the blame on her..it was interesting after all .

The other movie was called: ""casse-tete chinois"" (spoilers) that one I love cause french have a way to convey all feelings and the strangeness of human relationships in a non-judgy way .. I am still trying to unlearn some things from my christian upbringing that damaged me and turn me more into a coward. This was like any other french movie of messy relationships style : a guy who just got divorced with 2 kids, wife decides to move to NY with another guy; he follows her in the meanwhile he also donates sperm to his best friend who is a lesbian ; gets to NY pretend a false marriage to get the greencard, gets into a relationship with another girl with 2 kids as well - in the meanwhile lesbian girl cheats on her lesbian wife with the nanny.. my favorite part of the movie is when he realizes his life is a mess and tells it to the girl and she just does a gesture like: not really - you never been en china - and then you feel like the whole plot simplifies and somehow takes you to the realization that life in fact is pretty simple. 

It's almost midnight - I am going to watch some youtube stuff - I'll try to sleep early and go buy some things from the grocery store tomorrow ; I feel sad nobody has reply to my little announce to practice french around .. I do feel pretty lonely , I don't look for any wild relationship whatsoever but I do want to take a coffee , sit on a park and have long discussions about random things, french film, architecture, physics, feelings, existence, anthropology, psychology - random sht."
"So, yesterday my sister texted me asking if I wanted to get frozen yogurt tomorrow(today). I agreed. She should show up to pick me up in about 30 mins. This is pretty odd because she has never done this before. Anyway, I'll update if anything of significance happens.

Update: Well, luckily nothing bad happened. She did say that she wants to do this more often though. I think it’s nice that she’s finally making an effort to fix our relationship, but she should still get therapy or anger management."
"It looks like last nights journal entry got removed and I didn't notice, so here is journal entry #28

>I had a good day today, I went to the University area in downtown and hung out with this girl today. We got ice cream which was nice, the peaches and cream ice cream was sooooo friction good. I can't believe I had ice cream for breakfast hahahaha. I know I've been trying to lose body fat, but honestly I am happy so far with my progress so it's nice to treat myself. I should honestly become more consistent with my diet if I want to see long term results, but at least I am somewhat happy with where I am now.  
>  
>I honestly think that with my ex getting mad at me, for confusing reasons and never wanting to talk to me again, I feel that the weight of trying to keep her in my life is lifted off of my shoulders. I put a lot of effort into making her feel comfortable around me and yet she never really expressed the same level of effort I did. It's not her fault really because she has different views on relationship and friendships than I have, she should also just realize that she has to live with her choices as well, her choices where what led me to do what I did and go hang out with other girls and people that actually value my friendship and time.  
>  
>I also feel like I have the worst luck with girls because all of the people that I have gone out with have either ghosted me, broke my heart, or told me after hanging out for a while that they aren't looking for anything. I have never had just a normal relationship without any baggage or drama, which is frustrating because I just want someone to love and make feel special.  
>  
>Whatever, being single can be a lot better for mental health because then all I have to worry about is my problems and not other peoples. I can just be myself and do whatever it is that I want.  
>  
>Other than those thoughts, today was a good day. Work was super chill and I did the shipment for most of it in the back, just being by myself and relaxing. I also had a few sales which was nice but I honestly needed some time alone so that I could think and figure out what it is that I wanted.

Here is todays entry:

I didn't really do much today. I woke up around ten in the morning and went to the mall for my apple store appointment. I ended up getting the new product red Apple Watch series 6, looking back at these entries have made me realize how much money I spend and how much I could actually be saving. I know I went through a couple stages of minimalism, but I really should try and embrace it again. I do enjoy the things I have, but maybe getting rid/selling some of my old stuff will give me more space and give me more freedom from material things. 

After I got home I just relaxed in bed and played a lot of csr2, I am trying to finish the SF Finale so I can get the Camaro ZL1 1LE Nascar. It looks so nice, but I may have to spend a little bit of real money if I want to get it. It's frustrating but I understand that NM is a business and they realize people will actually spend money on it. Like me.

I watched game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals as well and it was entertaining, even though my team isn't in it, watching the Stars absolutely dominate the Lightning was amazing. I do enjoy these games because of how much is at stake. 

I think I do need a break, a little one from a lot of the things going on in my life, but at least I have this weight lifted off of my shoulders.

\-Love always,

J."
"Back in the day my brother and I worked at a haunted house. He was friends with the couple who owned the show so they asked him to bring some friends to help out. He picked me to play a demonic clown that sat near the end of the show at a long table in a dimly lit area because I'm kind of tall and broad shouldered.

Well he invited the very many adopted brothers we have and one such boy is a goofball and was very small and scrawny so he was assigned a goblin that would pop up from under a crate and goblin about.

Our haunted house had a story that went with it and each week would be a different theme through it to tell the story. Some characters would stay the same to tie into the story like mine and goblin's and the room beside mine full of diseased children in a hospital setting.

Well one night my blood brother was dressed as a very popular balloon toting clown and his job was to start out in a room with a cage that was accompanied by a shock stick that he would tap against the metal part of the cage to send out sparks while making threats. I had three women and one very muscular jock come running through the show without even looking at the other acts. Two of them, a woman and the jock, had to change clothes as they wet their pants. All because blood brother scared them witless.

Well blood brother noticed there was a large line outside being held up due to the slow group moving in the show so he went outside to scare the ones in line and caused a woman to faint and another teenage girl to run away down the street screaming. She did not come back.

During his little escapade outside the show was on hold to take care of the lady who fainted so we were put in break. During this break goblin decided to start a chain reaction by singing Barbie Girl in his highest pitched voice he could muster.

He could be heard through the entire maze and caused the children to start up too. So nobody heard the cue to be ready for a new group over the speaker system.

The new group could hear a chorus of Barbie Girl in high pitch and off key as they moved through the maze. He was in the middle of chanting Barbie, Barbie, Barbie in a tiny demonic voice as he realized there was a group, finally, but was too invested to stop.

When they got the his area he poked his head out from under his crate and shouted Barbie! This earned him a kick to the face by a very large man who found the Barbie Girl singing and chanting terrifying.

Due to that I had to escort the group out and have them wait while he was checked over. He had a busted lip and a black eye but was otherwise fine and did not want to press charges and ruin the night so the group was released but the attacker was banned from returning.

At the start, before you are let in, you were told that touching the actors was prohibited and would result in a ban or charges as the majority of the actors were under age.

Well the next night one of our children jumped at a big guy and he shrieked and punched her in the face.

The kid was twelve.

So we shut down while I checked her over and the guy running the show called the police and the girl's mom. Lights came on and she was covered in so much fake blood we could not tell what was real or what was fake but she spit real blood on my table so I knew she was bleeding inside her mouth at the very least.

Given I am a minor germophobe I immediately set to scrubbing the area where she spit and where she was stationed while she was examined by medics.

We closed down for a couple nights to sanitize the area she bled in and redo the splatter of fake blood on the walls, ceiling and floor. That was fun for me.

The girl was removed from the show. Her mom let us know he had knocked her tooth out and she pressed charges to cover the medical bills.

After that every person let in had to sign a contract before being let in that they did not have a health issue that could result in death from being scared and that they knew they were not allowed to touch the actors.

When we started packing up and tearing the walls down and cleaning up I got a bit overzealous with ripping the maze walls apart and sliced my finger open on a nail bad enough it scarred. More blood clean up.

While I was being patched up goblin decided to joust with a mop and a rolling chair. Another adopted brother joined him and accidentally flung the much smaller goblin through a temporary door knocking his knee out of socket.

After that the wife of the owner who was a field medic for the army decided she was tired of patching up stupid and let us know that if we were not careful tearing down the maze we would not be asked to perform again.

We were on our best behavior after that, very calm and careful and serious.

We performed twice more with the couple before they turned the show over to a less than trustworthy person and left the state so the wife could be closer to her next station.

We all left the next year in the middle of the show. Did a complete walk out. We were supposed to be paid for our time from the earnings of the ticket sales. We were told that would not happen. We were told the money was not there. So being the little detective I snuck into her files and learned she has used the money that was supposed to pay for not only our employment, but the money for the insurance to run the show, on buying a new vehicle.

We were forced to walk out not because we would not be paid, but because it was illegal for us to run the haunted house without insurance. Without us her little money grab went under and she left the state as well. There has not been a haunted house in that area since."
"I can't believe it, but nothing today made me flip. I actually had a day where I had no flips, I just enjoyed being present and acting like a normal person. My brain finally cooperated with me and let me enjoy the things I was experiencing in the moment. 

Some of those moments include finishing the current cup in CSR2, Making a good sale at work, making plans for tomorrow, and finishing The Man From U.N.C.L.E. which is such a good movie that I think I want to re-watch it. I loved the performances and the editing, all of which just immersed me into the world. 

I made a new playlist on my YouTube music that is the perfect mix for me to drive fast and have fun with the windows down. I love the feeling as I can feel my car (I named her Lucy) pull ahead of the other cars around me, just me and the road, nothing but possibilities. I've actually been looking at cars and I think I've narrowed down my options for my next car, but all I know is that I want to customize it. I want to make my next car completely my own and enjoy it for as long as it will run.

It is past midnight now and I still have laundry to do, but I just felt like writing that today was a good day. I hope tomorrow is just as good, I'm meeting up with the person I went driving around Seattle with the other night, and I think it's nice to have a friend that is there for me. But let's not get into that right now and end the night on a good note. 

\-Love always,

J."
"It's so hard to do the right thing sometimes, but I'll do it, cuz I don't want to be that guy. But god you make it so hard. When you posted on your story that you felt starved for touch, I just wanted to curl up and cry with you. I wanted to bring you stuffed animals so you wouldn't be alone. That's why I sent you the picture of the teddy bear. All I wanted that night was to be there for you. But I can't. It is so incredibly hard to hold it all back. But there's a line in front of me that I can't cross, even though I want to so badly. You've already got someone there for you. I know it's bad but sometimes I wish she wasn't. I wish it was me. Honestly I'm not sure how much you've caught on, if you actually *do* know how I really feel about you. If you do, then you've got a damn good poker face. And if that's the case then you probably don't give a damn about me, at least not in the way I do about you. I've talked to my friend about you, too. How I can't stop thinking about you. I was hoping that venting about you would make me less obsessive. And honestly it did. But only for a day or two. And then I saw your post on your story. I wish I could redo it all. I missed my shot, my chance so many months ago. Before you were with her. I regret it every day now. I wish I could go back and time and smack my stupid self for what he was about to pass up. But I can't. And now you're with her. And that's okay. It has to be okay. Because if it's not, then I won't ever stop thinking about you. And then maybe one day I will cross that line. But that's not me. I don't want to steal you away. You're happy with her. Maybe even happier than you'd be with me. So it has to be okay. But god it's so hard to do the right thing sometimes."
"Today was my first day at my new job and it was really good. I enjoyed working and figuring out what it was that drew me to this job over my old one. I think it is that it seems a lot more relaxed than a lot of the other places I have worked. Not relaxed in the same sense of not having to do work, but relaxed as in that I have a better support system from top down, that I can actually trust the leadership. 

It was fun, but I wasn’t fully into it like I was at my other jobs because I didn’t quite feel the instant click with the crew that I felt at my previous two other jobs, but it could have also been that I was out of it today because of a weird night and not sleeping well.

I got some new workout clothes today which is super nice because I need more fitness related apparel. Tomorrow is a day off of work so I’ll probably just be chilling for most of the day, I do have plans to go do some Pokémon Go raiding with a friend tomorrow night. It’ll be fun hanging out with groups of friends again once everything goes back to normal.

I think I do need to be able to adapt to this job a bit differently than I have at previous jobs, but like usual I think I’ll figure it out. It does seem like a super nice crew and everyone is so friendly, but my mind just wasn’t ready to go through it today despite two days off of working. 

Anyways, tomorrow is going to be a good day for self care and just relaxing. Then back to the grind on Thursday. 

-Love always,
J."
"This time today two years ago, I was driving, on my way to end things with my partner of 6 years. 

Two years on and it still feels so surreal it happened. 

It still feels so surreal that I saw the pictures and videos of him cheating.

The next day two years ago, I completely stopped talking to my best friend. My confidante. The shoulder I snuggle into. My rock I hold on to so tight. It feels like the floor just gave way underneath my weak knees.

Two years on and I’m still only now realizing the clues he peppered around me, the only one oblivious to them. 

Two years.

May seem short to some, but for me in this moment, it feels like a lifetime. A lifetime of replaying the same scenes over and over again in my head.  

Can the universe please just tell me what’s happening, why it’s happening and how long more must I endure?

It’s the betrayal and lack of trust that kills me every single time. It’s realizing that maybe you didn’t feel comfortable enough to tell me you woke up today with not a shred of love for me anymore. 

You’ve found another garden to tend to. While you left me with an illusion that our garden is blooming when in fact it’s decaying from within. 

I’ve run out of tears but I finally found words. Hopefully I’d be able to spill them as freely as the tears I spilt thus far."
"Sit down, take a deep breath. In and out. I had to keep telling myself that today. Tomorrow is a new day, which means new possibilities, new chances, a new start. A day where I can get things right for once. Today I didn't talk to her much, it was interesting because yes I missed her but I realized I don't need her to be happy. I know I have probably said that before, but today I actually had a good day, a day that I could be myself and a day where I am not afraid to say what is on my mind.

Either way I enjoyed today, even if work was a bit stressful. It was only as stressful as I let myself get stressed, and as the day went on I realized a lot of it was out of my control and that it wasn't really worth the effort into getting worked up over it but instead I should just roll with it until there was something that I could change on my own.

I also have Sunday and Monday off so I'm excited, I think I want to go for a hike but I am not sure if I want to do that alone or find a friend to go do that with. I might want to do this one trail I used to do a lot more with my friend, but I'm not sure if he is free to go either of those days. Either way I think at least one of those days I will continue to try and figure out what else I can do, like do meal prep and plan for my next quarter for school.

I didn't get my 4.0 because the professor did include assignments which no one could have completed. But it's okay, I still finished with a 94% overall. I mean at least I got all A's this quarter which is something to be happy about.

One thing that is on my mind is I am not sure if I am going to hear back from her tonight, but alas, there is no point worrying about it. I still need to do a few things like organize my room and plan my day for tomorrow. Either way I think I am going to put on some music and relax for a while.

\-Love always,

J."
"I had a dream tonight. I was supposed to remember it. I don't. It probably was something good or, .... I faintly remember there was me and many others. Don't know if we were fighting someone or I was being chased but something surely good happened, like a victory, because I said to myself to remember it. 

Before this, the one I remember was the hilarious one - social research and jargons and the funny remark by a guy ... before that the one where we two people were smuggling a vegetable and bus and police and toilet etc. The one before that was told to chan and forgotten. I wanted to write it down. I don't remember what I dream these days, and it's good. I hardly get deep sleep because of this pain. And it's expected to be worse now; both. The more painful it gets, the more I hate M , and I hate myself but it's nothing new. There was this poem....by her.. it was something about home and that it's you. And my home is wretched and exposed but concealed. It's not a good place. And I know hundreds of ways to make it good but I can't. I am sorry. I wish we built homes for someone else; you would have a chance to be somewhere better. Or you could invade someone else's home like goldilocks... people do that - engulf your home with theirs, take away the light like the parasitic plant, choking you and leaving you hungry while they feed on your nutrients , fight for space and air...the more host makes , the more the parasite gets. If it doesn't or eventually after all the energy making, the host will die and the parasite will have nothing to feed on so it will too or it will move to some other host. I don't know I just wanted a home for myself. And, for now, it seems I have no energy to make my home. There was no meaning of the life of the host or the parasite. Perhaps there's ..I am sure there's none in ours. And if 42 is the answer to the universe, then surely you are joking Mr Adams."
"It has been an eventful day today! I got to sleep in which was nice because one thing that has been happening recently is that I have been waking up several times throughout the night so I have not been getting a lot of sleep. Last night I only woke up twice throughout the night so I got more sleep than usual. I do think it's because of my phone addiction and my need to continuously text people back. Either way I think tonight I am going to sleep with my phone on dnd and not beside my bed. It has been an eye opener to think about the issues with my sleeping patterns. I do hope that I can sleep all the way through till my alarm for tomorrow. 

I also got a little bit of closure with my ex last night. I was continuously trying to win her back because I had some hope that eventually she would choose me and love me back. But last night squashed all hope from my system at getting back with her so instead I can focus on being friends with her. I think it will be an interesting adjustment not (caring?) trying as hard anymore. I mean it's not like I won't text her back or ignore her, but putting in the same effort for someone you love versus someone who's a close friend is different imo. Either way I will have more time to focus on myself. 

I had a good afternoon, I spent it with my mom and we just went around the mall looking at things which was nice. We found some nice glassware which I think we're going to buy off of amazon. I also got to see my new workplace near closing time which was nice to see it wasn't busy so it doesn't look like it will be as stressful. 

I had KFC for dinner tonight and I feel lethargic and groggy now, I shouldn't eat like that as much anymore because of my new goals. But at least I have been lifting weights more often now and I do personally feel stronger than I had before. Either way I think I am going to go to bed early tonight. 

\-Love always,

J."
"Today I gave my weeks notice at my current job, I decided to accept the offer at the other place because I have to do what's best for me at the end of the day. I have tomorrow and Wednesday off, so I have a couple days to re-coup and figure out what I'm going to do, but other than that I don't have plans. Actually I think I'm meeting with a couple of friends to get coffee tomorrow afternoon. It'll be good to catch up with a couple of them. 

I had an epiphany today just now, just before I decided to write. I figured out what it was I meant to the people in my life. And I also realized I shouldn't assume things. Assumptions make a fool out of everyone, so I need to roll back my emotions and my minds fast pace and take a more logical approach to it. And that may be bad because I might not like what I see, but I kind of need to know.

Either way I think taking a step back and just being by myself and figuring out what I need in my life is very important. I am having a very emotional night and it's not good for me to be interacting with those that I have fragile/rebuilding relationships with. But this is the time I keep contacting them. And It also keeps me remembering her, remembering those last moments before she was gone. and it hurts, and it destroys me. But I push through, and I try to fix the relationships I break whenever I have nights like these. I just wish I could be honest with both myself and those people that are close to me. 

either way my mind is racing and my heart is beating like crazy. I do need to sleep and ignore the world for a while. I do hope that I don't do anything stupid tonight and I guess I should take precautions and just go to bed. But I don't know how I can sleep while my emotions are going crazy. Either way, laying in bed with my eyes closed I'll hopefully just pass out. Because I am the only person who cares about my emotions and the only person who is responsible for them, it is unfair to burden those around me with any of this and instead I will write it out on the internet for strangers. Because at the end of the day I am not strong enough to do this by myself, but my friends are not supposed to be there for me in these times. 

\-Love always,

J."
"I am writing this 4 days after it happened. To my dear Nursella, I wish you happiness and good fortune. A story suited for fairy tales, brought to real life.

A pleasant surprise to put it lightly. Yes, an ecstatic surprise. Yet, despite the time that has passed. My heart is just as warm as it was when her unplanned arrival first brought a smile to my face. The embers still burn with the strange feeling that the lingering smoke hidden by the starlit sky is whispering, this is ""destiny"" before it sweetly envelops your sleeping eyes through twilight til dusk. Such a fated meeting. Such a ""coincidence."" How could that be so? When all hope seemed lost. When the final goodbyes had seemed to have already been said. When the reason for why she chose to try and sever the ties with me was the distance was too great of a barrier. She lived out west, and I was bound south. When I had delivered her a phone number that could not receive calls or texts, so she could have thought I was ignoring her, when I would never do so to such a beautiful and sexy young woman. Problems which were only remedied a little more than a week ago after I called her on my new phone. When it seemed like I had made the final phone call, and I'd get sad that we'd probably grow more distant from that day forward. A sad expectation foreseeing the splashing and messing about drowning in the ocean of forgotten memory. Well, that's what I thought. And never have I been happier in finding out I was wrong!

After days of text messages back and forth about study and what we were both up to, and daily friendly well wishes with no foresight into ever meeting in person again. My most favorite coincidence in the world happened.

Her friend moved 4 houses down from my street. A friend whom she often visited when she lived in another part of the city. Anyway, they were working on an assignment together. And around 1pm on the 27th of August she remembered my address, which she learned of through my sharing of my property valuation assignment which I did on my own house.

She said she was in danger, struggling and she cried out for help. The chivalrous knight in me got on my horse and went to rescue. However, there was no need for a horse. As she called me and asked if she could come over, since she was so close to where I live. I was embarrassed about the mess and nervously said can you give me 10 minutes to clean up. I was so excited to see her and he beautiful heart warming smile, her pretty face, her outrageously sexy body and to hear her sweet-cinnamon toned voice. I didn't actually do much cleaning, but I soon gave her the okay to come over and told her ""I'd wait for you at the driveway.""

She does the classic, let him wait a little longer to amplify the anticipation trick. And it worked! But soon after, whilst dressed in an orange worker shirt and shorts I eagerly walk up to the driveway in response to her text ""I'm coming over x!"" There she is, metres away from me. She's was wearing her grey pants that she always wears and a jacket covering a purplish or blue shade singlet that I have never seen her wear before. I found it irresistibly attractive, even though she wasn't even trying!

This is after 2 weeks of the second lock down, where I was truly very happy to see her. She smiles and says 'Hey' in that velvet toned voice of hers and she walks slowly up to me with her sexy gait which had the song ""I like the way you move"" play in my head. After I regather my composure and wait for her to reach me, she stops for guidance. I was so caught up in the moment I forgot I hadn't shaved and must have looked like a scruffy mess. She didn't seem to care. We were both excited and happy and I guide her to walk with me to the back of the house.

I said something like ""Crazy how your friend lives so close"" And we made some more small talk as we walked together. I told her in advance over the phone ""Please don't make any questions about any of the holes in the walls"", where she laughed which warmed me greatly. So right before we turn past the corner revealing a broken back door, I anticipate her reaction. I turn to her and signal we should continue. Then she saw it and her face lit up laughing but shocked at seeing a rubbish bag take the place of a glass panel in the back door. I was a combination of embarrassed for myself but delighted to see her smile. As I open the door and let her in I say to her ""Hey, like I said on the phone, no questions."" And she eagerly asked ""Hey what happened."" A question where I hated the words, but I loved to hear her voice. My love for her voice outweighed any lingering embarrassment that I may have still had.

We both entered the house, she turns to the part of the house where my brother was. And I redirected her and said ""No, over here. This way."" She followed my lead and I guided her up to the stairs to the master bedroom where I stayed. I said ""How did that hole in the wall get there, how did the wallpaper get like that. Oh sorry, I was just reading your mind."" And she laughed as she saw the wear and tear that I had pointed out to her.

I walk her over to my desk in the far corner and she takes a brief look around to where she will be staying for the next couple of hours. She tries to grab one of the outdoor deck chairs I had brought inside, and brought it over to my overly sized desk, but I said ""No you can have a wheely chair."" which I held for her to sit in and she said ""Thank you.""

There she was, the beautiful Nursella, sitting next to me at my desk. The one I am, sitting at right now. Inches away and smiling. In the middle of winter, with her brightness and beauty I confused it for summer.

After a few nervous exchanges about the mess, we make some jokes and laugh together to settle any nerves. She reassures me ""Colm, Calm down, I am not judging you. It is fine."" which was so sweet and helped me grow more comfortable. I almost forgot that she came over for help with her assignment as I got lost in her eyes and caught up in the moment. I then load up the information on my Acer laptop to begin helping. But she has to shoot off to her friends to charge up her phone. This is where she saw the broken back door from the inside and we awkwardly stood and she asked ""What happened?"" And sadly, I had a zoom class to teach so this will leave us with only 1 hour of exchange time.

She left her laptop there, whilst she was gone. So she trusted me! I did not betray her trust and left her things alone. She comes back and makes her way to my room without any need for my guidance this time. A quick learner! She already knew how to get around the place! I was delighted to see her again.

This time, I wanted things to get a little flirty. So after watching her type away, I silently stare at her for several long seconds. She sees me staring and looks at me with an expression as if to say ""Why are you looking at me like that?""  I then tease her and say ""You only type with 2 fingers."" A reference to an inside joke after she mocked me weeks earlier for only typing with 1 finger, like an old person who has never used a computer before. She laughed and blushed, where she said ""You're roasting ME now!"" And she added ""Well it is one more than you!"" in a youthful sharp and witty but striking tone. I enjoyed her playful jabs, they felt like cushions from heaven itself. A paradise of sorts.

Anyway, after helping her with the first part of the section she needed help with. I notice her breathing very heavily, as was I. I believe a mix of the flirting and the helping her with something she really needed had brought attraction to the room. I accidentally lightly brush her leg as I reach over to clear some space for her. This seemed to create more tension between us. Towards the end of the hour the light and friendly vibe turned to more tense, but a sexual kind of tension. She was in my bedroom after all. The queen size bed was only a light stroll away. I began to gaze upon her beautiful body from her side. She looked delicious and so sexy.

However, after many minutes of heavy breathing and reaching over each other to grab stuff on my desk with the hope we would touch each other and escalate things further, I had to do my zoom tutorial session. I did so reluctantly as I would have preferred to spend the next 2 hours with her. The beautiful Nursella! She said ""I don't want to hold you up."" But all I wish for is her to hold me up, interrupt me or run away with me to someplace nice. Or just stay here. Anyway, I start the zoom session and she laughs at my reluctance to do so, and she stays for the first 20 minutes, laughing at me making a fool of myself. After she reaches over to grab a pen from in front of me. She writes on a piece of paper ""Am I distracting you by being here?"" Which I whispered to her ""No, you can stay. I am more worried about you being able to do your work with me talking"" She stays for another 10 minutes before she says ""I am going to leave, can you message me when you're done"" I then saw the beautiful and sexy angel walk away. The pleasant surprise seemed to be over. And I then finished the class and tutorial.

I message her at 5:30pm saying the class was over and asked if she was still at her friends place or if she had gone home? She said she was still there and had KFC for dinner. She asked if it is alright to pop over! And I of course say ""YES!"" This time she brought her car.

When she first came she had to back out as my dad was coming, and there she first saw my dad. 4 months of chatting and she already met one parent. I then guide her to park and often stand outside her car window that was wound down so I could talk to her. Finally she parks. I walk her past the garden and she said she loved the Hydrangeas. I walk her back to my room and said ""Dodgy back door"" before we go in. She sits back at the seat I had first set for her, at my desk. We chat a wee bit, and she tells me ""This is a Dream House"" And ""This will be a nice place to watch movies."" And I hoped she meant ""Nice place to watch movies with me"" but I never asked or said that. A missed opportunity.

After turning on all the lights for her. She soon tells me ""I should have dinner"" And I ask her ""If she wants anything to drink?"" To which she replies ""No I'm alright."" And so I go down for around 20 minutes to eat dinner before I report back on my overcooked supermarket chicken breast, rice and kumura.  When I return to my room, she stands up from her seat with her back turned and turns her head toward me. This nearly seduced me, but I wanted to have her see more of the place. So I say ""Hey, come over here."" And she follows my lead. I then say yeah the movie thing sounds great, but I don't have a screen. Where could I put it?"" And she shows me to one of corners in the room that faced the queen sized bed. And I said ""That's a great idea."" I then got excited and started walking around the room and stopped with her standing by my bed. She said to me ""Honestly, this is a dream house. You're room is so big!"" And she added ""My room is so small. It's probably the size of this."" whilst outlining my queen sized bed. This is the closest the beautiful Nursella and I were to both standing outside my well made bed at the same time. Oh you bet I thought of the possibilities!

I then guide her back to my desk. Where she lays her phone out with a picture of her boyfriend as the screen theme. I peer over and take this as a hint that she doesn't want things to escalate as she is loyal to her boyfriend of 2 and a half years. She apologizes for having her phone out, which I said was of no worry. I then try and help her but am more sluggish from the meal and she seems tired as well. She also begins feeling uncomfortable and starts mentioning my parents asking if they are alright with her being there and then hinted at the fact she wants to leave.

This was after I hinted my brother and mother are not as welcoming to strangers as my dad was. This is probably my only regret for that AMAZING DAY! This is because she later said ""Is it alright for me to stay here"" Which I reassured her it was. But she still seemed uncomfortable and wanted to leave.

From 7 10 pm to 7 30 pm I fail to teach her the second part of the assignment and she yawns, and acts less flirty and says ""I don't want you to stay up all night doing this"". I get the signal at 7 30 pm, and the flirty fun deflated in this time. I ask her if she knows how to get out and she says she thinks so. And I say ""Well I'll walk you out anyway, because it is dark."" She seemed to be flattered but did not say anything. Anyway, we get to the dodgy back door and she once again asks ""What happened?"" To which I replied ""I'll tell you in one months time.""

I try and get a torch on my phone and we both get to her car. There, she seems to be less willing to engage in flirty conversation and she keeps things fairly dry. Most likely due to her boyfriend. Anyway, I say ""I'll see you in our next class"". And she hops in her car without too much of a final exchange other than ""Oh I think its back to face to face classes next week."" A sad comedown to the high of her initial visit, heavy breathing and all. However, I did notice she had dry lips the first time and it appeared she applied lip gloss when she came back later that evening. Maybe, she wanted  things to be like how they were in the first visit, but fate had not shone upon that possibility on that day.

Anyway, to my dear Nursella, thanks for the checkup. You are a great nurse, and I was truly both physically and mentally excited to see you and your sexy smile and body!

May my wishes of more encounters with you come true. Love you lots. I even watched the first Twilight film again because of you.

&#x200B;

Love from,

Your favorite mental patient.

Sir Crazy Insane Man - She knows who I am."
"Today I had my final class for summer quarter meaning I have 4 weeks off of school! I'm excited that I no longer have to worry about assignments for a bit. But as that stress ends, a new one begins. The new one being that it looks like I am going to be offered a new job at a fitness apparel store. The job looks more fun and definitely looks less stressful than my current job (as well as much less stress than my previous job). The only thing is that I do like my current job and I'm worried it will look like I jump ship quickly, when it's just that I didn't expect to get another interview because of the amount of time in-between application and the call for an interview. It also seems like I will vibe a lot better at this new job than my current one.

Other than that I just had a nice relaxing day. I bought a new chronograph Tissot for my new growing collection. It goes really well with my new leather bomber that I have been looking at for a while. I honestly shouldn't spend anymore money this month, and I don't think I will. I only do retail therapy to take my mind off of the bad thoughts and honestly it does help me quite a bit. 

I have been thinking about her a lot, thinking about what I should do and how I should act towards her. I love her so much, it was April 27th when I realized I would love her forever no matter what happened between us, so exactly 4 months. I really don't deserve her, she has stuck with me throughout everything and she still talks to me even after I acted crazy and even when I let my stress and insecurities get between us. I don't care what has happened, because the past is the past and I hope she is my future. But I know some things for people are things that they can't get over, and I just have to accept whatever she decides. I know that I'll do my best to be happy with whatever she chooses. I just hope she chooses me.

I look at other relationships and I realize that breaking up is just someone realizing they don't want to work on the relationship anymore. Almost everything is fixable, and I think I will always want to try and fix things with who ever I love. But for me I can be too honest sometimes, because being honest isn't just telling the truth when asked, but it's telling the other person how you really feel when you feel it because hiding the emotions and thoughts is a form of lying to me. So I will always try my best to be honest.

Tomorrow I work, and I have to ask them about school schedule changing so I would have to change my availability and I honestly think that would be the deciding factor for me in how I choose between this job and the other offer. You already know what we chose when reading this in the future, but hopefully you remember how stressed I am about this right now. 

It's late and I should sleep soon, but that's pretty much a quick update for tonight. I'll write again tomorrow.

\-Love always,

J."

""A new day has come, but the brain still bets on yesterday""

I was hallucinating because my brain was protecting me. I hate myself, but in a biochemical, almost primordial way, my brain cares about me. It does the same with dreams, it gives me the exact scenarios I long for desperately, not knowing about the resulting existential crisis I have when I wake up.

The chest bobbed up and down peacefully, in a calm sleepy breath, an impossibility since he was dead, even slightly in shock I was aware of this. I'm a rational person, I pride myself on being a sceptic and mocking ghost stories, yet at that moment I was seeing a ghost. I don't remember if it made me feel calm, that emergency defensive mechanism designed to shield you from an image too traumatic to process, but I found solace in analysing the phenomenon, in feeling how something was happening to me after months of pathological apathy, how I was just temporarily losing my mind. They are called bereavement hallucinations, and I guess that's how people invented being haunted.

The morning after that, A creak on the bathroom door was replaced by his voice calling my name in a tone that I knew perfectly, that's how he called me when he had a question. (What was the question this time? ""Should I turn right to get into purgatory?"" there was nothing I could do any more) I looked it up later, turns out there is science about it. As my perception had yet to catch up with the loss of something so consistent and valued, which my brain was so used to predicting, it continued to do so, overruling reality. Isn't that fascinating? Our brains can bend reality, even for just a minute, a second, just to keep us safe.

It rained during the early morning and it was like a sedative, I slept until nine. I've been dizzy and brain foggy all day and I would really like to know why, since I keep going from bed to chair to avoid falling on my face. Maybe I already had corona and these are the neurological sequels everybody is talking about?

Yours truly,

Agatha"

""You don't consider anything beyond the tip of your nose Aggie""

Adrian spent 2 years trying to shag me, even though he didn't really like me. As a deeply closeted Christian, he was just trying to prove something. During this time he was a knowledgeable source of observations on my character like that one, so dammed accurate that I keep it in mind to this day. His philosophical considerations on my nature were mostly fuelled by cocaine and academic exhaustion during our college freshmen all-nighters a few years ago.

We would lie defeated on the library table at 4 am, awaiting judgment by an economics final that we would both eventually fail twice before transferring to a less violent institution, and he would tell me all jittery and manic about how 90% of my life happened inside my head.

It was true, I barely consider the outside, the other and the connection. I like the world in respect to it giving me something to feel. Adrian was the same, he wanted to feel everything, and that's why we would hang out at night,  taking me to the most depressing strip clubs, those that stay open until 6 am, pushing down on the accelerator to 120 km/hr on that trashy hummer his mommy had bought him, and indulging my curiosity to visit illegal bars in musty downtown basements where we could have been stabbed.

But Adrian could afford to be chaotic and aimless, he had his family’s money and business to rely on, as long as he was an obedient Christian and managed to control his nature. I, on the other side, have to reconcile with the real world if I ever want to be functional.

I woke up late again today, which was a mistake because The Lady hoards the kitchen from 10:30 am to 5:00 pm and I lose my meal prep window. So I ordered a hot chocolate for breakfast again, I've probably had 40 litres of hot chocolate since March, it's my quarantine obsession. Everyone seems to have one, pizza, online shopping, beer, weed. Something for comfort that makes the new routine bearable. Unfortunately, mine probably causes diabetes.

Yours Truly,

Agatha"
"I want to make a friend. However this task seems impossible now. I am alone save for my small family circle and have no way of actually interacting with people.

I was told church would be the best way to meet new people of any worth. Thing is; I know a lot about my religion that would seem taboo to any church in this day and age.

Once, when I was young and church going, I was told it was okay to question your religion, that it was okay to read deeper into the meanings of your holy book.

That is no longer the case. Now you are expected to obey all of the writings of an old, outdated, misinterpreted book; instead of seeking knowledge on the subject and asking questions.

I cannot go into a church and not feel like a wolf among sheep. I have been, years ago, and offended the church goers by avoiding being embraced, avoiding unwanted comfort as they mistook a sad memory of a passed loved one for the touch of God in me as I wept from a hymn.

They grew angry when I pulled away from unwanted hugs, unwanted hands on me giving me misguided pats and back rubs. They drew back in rage when I told them it was not God I felt but sadness.

I was shunned so of course now should I walk through the doors of a church I can easily pinpoint those that will cause me problems. I have a keen eye and analytical mind, could have been well suited for a studious job, so now I will look through that throng of people and be able to pick them apart easily.

Which ones are only there because they feel they have to be, not because they want to be.

Which ones are bigots, hypocrites, have unwarranted phobias based on the lives of others.

Gone are the days where I was able to set foot in a place of worship and feel safe. Gone are the days where I followed blindly a storybook without questioning its contents. Gone are the days when I had childlike trust in those around me.

I am an open person. I am am honest person. That does not mean my trust is easily won. I do not even trust my own self to keep me safe, how am I to trust another human being with my happiness and well being?

So yes, I would like to make a friend, but a sheep is not meant to be friends with a wolf. Long ago maybe, when times were different, but no longer.

I am not a savage beast, but I am cunning.

I am not untameable, but I am wild.

There is no longer a place of worship I trust. People are too ready to attack you for having your own beliefs within your own religion than they are willing to listen to your point of view.

But I will try. I will look for a place of worship and test them. I will show my colors brightly, and watch them squirm, avoid my gaze, and will be ready to be shunned once again.

I am lonely, so I will try to find a friend. I doubt anything will come of it, but nothing is ever gained without trying. And when I see them fail test after test, I will move on leaving hate in my wake like scorch marks.

I will not wear the wool of a sheep to fit in. I will walk in with fangs bared and ready. They will see me as I am. I am tired of running. I am tired of fearing the herd. If I am trampled then at least I tried.

I always have my family to fall back on in the end."

""The last day you have on earth, the person you became will meet the person you could have become.""

Wonder if there was any regret, on those last moments. It took about 15 minutes for him to die, the heart trashed and shattered in one last struggle to live, the gasps and the vomiting, the neck losing strength, the head rolling limp. (Were there any last words? I've never dared to ask.) I wonder if there was any time for reflection or if it was all a blur of adrenaline and doom. Even if he had gone peacefully, with time to say goodbye, I doubt there would have been any revelations. His character had a story but barely an arc, he lived and died the same, difficult and bright and awful and cruel and loving. Wonder if he thought of me, of my mother and her siblings, did he worry about us at the end?

I wanted him to be proud of me so badly, I wanted to win. At the end I did, but it was not satisfying whatsoever. I was the first, favourite and the beloved, but that went so numb at the end, while he was busy ranting at death and the cosmos. We can't live for the death, for memories and collected pains, As much as Luka might want to. The death must lie, and we must keep walking...even if we are going nowhere.

""Despair is for those who already know how the story ends.""

It was terrifying, but I survived it. The build-up seems to have been worse than the actual moment and its aftermath. This last three years felt like a noose getting increasingly tighter against my neck and then the rope just fucking snapped before strangling me. I've been resting ever since. So sleepy, so inert, so pointless. The world coming to a halt is a comfortable justification, there is no need for action while we all hide at home like the air is poison and time becomes a homogenous stream of ubereats, Netflix and vitamin D deficiency.

I couldn't eat much today, Greyscale and her mom hung in the kitchen all day, being Freudian and unpleasant while I holed out in the room, being cowardly and non-confrontational to the point of blood sugar complications. I'm lucky that during this time of the month I don't feel much hunger. I need to get my own place, I need to make money.

The rainy season it's at its peak, so everything is in a constant state of grey wetness, the sounds are great for sleep.

Yours truly,

Agatha."
"So, quite a bit happened today.

First, today was school registration day for the freshmen. My mom and I planned to go at 9. 

While I was getting ready my parents started yelling again. I shrugged it off. In the car my mom told me what happened. Basically, my dad came into her room and was complaining about how the barista at Starbucks didn't fill his cup completely.

Cut to 5 pm. My dad asks me to call my mom because she isn't picking up when he calls her. She didn't pick up. Then my dad asked me if I wanted to know what happened this morning. I said ok, then he asked me to come down stairs with him. 

For some reason he was telling me about how he painted the walls and stuff. Then he finally got to the story. He basically said the same thing as my mom, but he was exaggerating a lot of things. 

He also said that my mom was barking like a dog, that she has anger issues, that my oldest brother manipulated my sister into hating him, that he didn't cheat on my mom, that he takes care of me(which he doesn't) and this is the best part: that the man that my mom gave a ride to 5 years ago caused our family to become dysfunctional. Lmfao

My mom came back around 30 mins ago and I told her that dad was talking about her, but I didn't tell her what he was specifically saying."
"So, I haven’t posted in a while. I wrote the birthday part of this on the 15th, but I put it in the drafts because I didn't have motivation to finish writing it. Anyway, here's what happened.

7/15/20:

I was right about my sister. She complained about how she didn't have her own things, like her own room, car, etc. The thing is that she already has those things. She has her own room at home(and at the house she's staying at), and she has a car, which one of my brothers gave her(which makes it even funnier for her to hate him.)

Another thing that happened was my dad coming over for dinner. Since my brother & sister didn't want to see him they decided that when he came by they would go back to the other house to pick some of their other stuff up. I thought that there wouldn't be any problems, but boy was I wrong.

When my dad got here he immediately wanted to fix something in the backyard. So he went and did that for like 20 mins. Then we ate dinner. While we were eating dinner it was mostly silent, until my dad asked where my siblings went. My mom told him that they went to the house. That made him pretty angry because nobody told him. I don't really remember what else happened, but what I do remember is that my dad said something to piss my mom off while she was bringing out the cake. They didn't yell or anything but I almost cried, so I bit my tongue to prevent that. When I blew out the candles I wished for an actual happy birthday with my future SO. 

On the car ride back home with my dad he was venting to me about how someone should have told him they were going to the house because he was worried they would have ""done something"" Then he said how he should have cleaned up his room because he didn't want them to see his underwear and stuff. He then brought up the topic of changing the locks on the front door because he didn't want my siblings going back to the house unannounced bc they don't live here anymore.

And now for everything that happened today.

8/9/20:

Today my mom and I planned on making one of my favorite meals for dinner, and lately she's been teaching me how to cook so I was pretty excited for tonight. 

But that wouldn't happen.

Instead, my dad and mom argued, yelling at each other, until my mom decided she had enough. She packed her bags and went to the ""A"" house.

I'm not really mad at my dad, just really disappointed. 

I think I'm going to cut him out of my life once I move out.

(6:31 pm)Update: Well, my mom didn't actually leave. She was in my dad's room and they were talking for the past hour or something. Anyways, I get to cook with my mom which is good, I guess."
"I am very angry. I was in a dream. It was about the same thing that you have been angsty about. Some shit happened and like real life you were controlling or containing, who the fuck knows what you do, it and then I got angry and said shit to PP. I was angry because I was angry, and I felt helpless and injustice and like a tragedy has stuck . It would have been comic had I not been starring in it. I wonder how anger forms..is it ..I guess it has to be either one is offensive or defensive. To scare shit off or to warn that piece of shit or , . I am at uncle Lewis' home . He's ...good. Yesterday, ...not that anything bad happened in the last 2 days. It was all good actually. Better than normally good. But it makes me sad .... I feel there is an injustice. The world isn't just, I get it. But am I in the wrong...well I could be for wishing there was justice , for wishing a miraculous rule of justice to exist in the world. And forgive me for it but I can't stop hoping for it  and and forgive me getting angry when that fictional rule doesn't seem to my naive brain to be applied.  .... Similar people can be so different based on just one facet. It's sad for Piwan to have to only ...well I guess he didn't always only think so*...but to only think everything from one point of view....at least that's how it seems now ....*and this merely something that he thought he would balance out shit by exhibiting his craft. 

To talk about yesterday, we eat and shit. Oh yeah I didn't a lot of cleaning and scrubbing in the morning...I am glad I don't keep to do lists, they would be forgotten like the 100 unopened tabs on a phone. ..uncle Lewis and Aurum went to Piwan in the morning ...no wait this happened day before. So I guess we yeah normal shit. In the noon I went to my roomie. Oh it was so hot. I had a long nice nap. Uncle Lewis keeps following the one news whole day. Hmm I challenged few people to chess against him. Then when I went back, Aurum's old friend was there but we didn't see. And in the evening everybody else went shopping . But I went roof and it rained ..abrupt. And i went back to roomie and yeah Uk was born lol. Shat about everywhere. And the evening happened pretty fast when they returned . And I had this dream... because I know I had this one thought at one moment. And it is ... like I want to just tell it to him; he seems so blind to it or as if ..well I will need 10 seasons to explain it but in conclusion, why are people stupid sometimes..

I also thought that I don't like to mingle with people easily. They are just bad and unacceptable to me. I like even the silky things with UL and UL. That playing with the ball was so fun :D I like it when I get serotonin. ...my current mood is that song ' if you find god in your gf's bed' ....that game was fun. I like that ball. And the banter over it or just anything ( almost ) (with ULs). I think I care too much about UL.....how does one , like when do you know when not to help and when to let a person do something by themself and when to let them watch make a mistake. I just want her to be happy...#and then massive crying....I feel like Ted right now, the lawyer in Scrubs. It was a massive mistake for you think that you knew how your life is going happen, and a massive one to think that life is just living however because what is life it were like a engineering project,; it's like you hold the matter and anti matter within yourself , no wonder you feel being destroyed. I hate I thought of the Julia Roberts vs workers question, I hate the thing that made me thought it, I wish I remembered what agam had replied to it..this was another massive error. Why did I even think of it..if only I had just read bailey or shit and not thought about crap. I hate the thing said in inception is so true. You know I don't get time to ruminate over shitty thoughts ATM because I keep getting distracted by shit to do - this is better than fermenting your brain in one thought. 

I got a haircut few days back. Sometimes it looks good , sometimes not. 

Day before yesterday, Aurum and all's first day here . They had arrived the night before. And Uncle Leewis left early morning...and hmm nothing much to say. Oh we went to the temple. I like the meditating part but I don't like when I get conscious that I am meditating..I hate the ocd too. OCD is quite there...at the beginning of every action or every rest station. And I saw a girl there that day , sweet young girl...I hope she's sweet. 

Before that day, ...not remember . One day we went to buy the ball . Shopping is a fun world. And we had the cheapest dinner. And we saw ?wolves . And then one day , my memory is not good diary. I wish you were a person. It would be nice if you could talk back. Better if you were wise and all. But even if you could simply do a simple conversation then wOuld have been nice. And then I would have told you , "" I wish you were wise , wiser than me if anything"". Well I will tell you what, it's not hard to be wiser than me. But a simple conversation is also nice. I just don't really feel like talking shit to anyone. Not even as simple as ' I like rose too' , loel fuck you . 

I have had few shower thoughts in the past few days. All forgotten. Lol I have had so many dreams...weird ones. Didn't write any of those. A desk where I could write anything with pen and paper without worrying someone reading it would be so nice. Sometimes you see just one thing in a person and like the whole of it and sometimes you hate one thing in a person and gate the whole of it no matter how 'good' the rest of it is. 

So many people ask me ' what do you really want '. I don't know how to answer it. Like it know the answer , probably, but I know know the parts of it or the steps. Or what really made me happy once or will keep me happy . Why is this...why is everything weird. And unpredictable and shitty. 

Anyway I hope we play the match I have 'organized'. 

If a painting came to life how would he feel."
"I just got a message from my coworker that I won't be coming in for tomorrow. Apparently, there was a schedule change, so I'll be working the Saturday shift...again. Meh, it's not a big deal, and it gives me an excuse to get out of the house. 

Nothing much else to say other than that. I'm hoping for a miracle at this point for all of this to go away, but I know it's not gonna happen.

Stay safe."
"My mom's boyfriend has a 7-year-old son. The first time I met him, I quickly figured out that he has ADHD. He would constantly talk about Sonic and ask questions like ""What would people think if I had legs like an octopus?"" or ""When can I meet Sonic in real life?"". I was able to get through having to live with him for 3 months because I knew his condition. I'd say it was also good for me because it was my first time having to live with someone who had ADHD. He left for a vacation at his mother's place for around 4 months last year; and when he came back, I couldn't comprehend how bad he has gotten.

&#x200B;

He wakes up very late, at most 3 P.M. and sleeps 4 A.M.He's staring at a phone from 2 to 12 P.M. and gets angry and screams whenever we tell him to put it down for lunch and stuff. Heck, he even screams at us sometimes and swears when the phone shuts down from low battery. He says he wants a PC for Minecraft, but when his dad says now is not the time for a PC, he tells him to be quiet. He tells us to shut-up when we try to correct him about anything. He probably believes EVERYTHING he sees on Youtube and tells us to stop or else, wait for it, he'll cut our tongues off. SERIOUSLY. HE LITERALLY GAVE US A DEATH THREAT FOR CORRECTING HIM. HOW? Okay, wait, I'll calm down for a bit.

&#x200B;

I'd list more experiences with him, but they all end with him screaming and more cutting of limbs (on varying body parts!). I know some people who'd read this will think that I need to be more patient toward him. I am trying my best, but I can't help but feel disgusted and sad that a 7-year-old learned to do all of these in a matter of 4 months. Right now, he's been in the house for 3 months; I just hope that his attitude takes a better turn."
"Silence, I shut my mouth.

"If thoughts move faster than light. Do they therefore move outside of time? I think so.

Have you considered people are living bridges?  One person talking to another person, conversation bridging people and ideas. Thoughts bridge people. People are bridges, partial bridges as least.


There are connections I should not pursue.  There are (oft enticing) paths I should not strengthen with travel."
"So, today I'm staying at the ""A"" house because my brother is driving my sister to take an important test in another city that is 8 hours away, and they needed me to babysit the kittens. 

My sister told me how to clean the litter box, how much food to give them, etc.

They left about 40 minutes ago. A few minutes after they left I went to play with one of the kittens, Apollo, in the living room. I pet him for a few minutes but he didn't really seem in the mood for pets, so I went back to the room I am staying in to do my own thing.

A few minutes later my mom comes into the room asking where the kittens are. I go to the living room but Apollo was nowhere to be found. We briefly checked around the house for any obvious places that they might be hiding, but nothing.

We were now worried so I get one of the rattle toys and start shaking it in hopes of one of them to come out. But still, nothing.

Now we were moving the couches and blankets in other rooms. But still, nothing.

We were contemplating telling my sister about it, but we chose to continue looking for a few more minutes.

My mom then texted my sister asking where they usually like to hide/sleep, and my sister replied ""Their cat tower or cardboard boxes."" 

The thing is that we have already extensively checked their cat tower and any cardboard boxes.

My sister then texted ""Why do you ask ahahahha"" and after looking around some more my mom finally texted back ""we think they are sleeping or hiding but we can't find them."" My sister replied that we should just stand in one place and rattle the toy and they should eventually come out.

Since we have already tried that, and rattling the toy all around the house my mom and I have decided to just wait it out in hopes that they're just asleep somewhere.

I just don't see where they would be asleep though. We already checked their favorite sleeping spots countless times.

Update(7:50 pm): Dear God so many things have happened and I'm so relieved. Basically, my dad showed up to help look for the cats. He even went around the block looking for them. After like 30 minutes he left. My mom continued to look. I made a TIFU post and people were saying to open wet cat food which I did, then I left it there and went back to my room. My mom then yells out ""THERE'S ONE OF THEM!!"" and I went running to where she was. And there was apollo. My mom lifted the couch and there it was. The hole. There was a hole under the couch, which they crawled into. They weren't behind the couch or under the couch. They were inside the fucking couch. We have now tapped it up."
"12:40 pm

""My mind is full of thoughts, yet it feels so empty.""

It was midnight, and I woke up from a nightmare. It felt really horrible. I was scared. Scared of losing control. I didn't remember what my dream exactly was about. It was like a rush of adrenaline, fragments runnning wild through my mind. My upper body was flaccid. I wanted to get back to sleep but I just couldn't. It was like someone pulling me, grabbing my back. More like my soul. My heart felt rested but not calm. That flash of series of events in my dream was terrible. I got out of bed, drank water and ate a pie. I then took my blood pressure, 90/50 mmHg, 90/40. I drank a mug of warm tea and Mom massaged my back for a little while. Got back to bed but my eyes and mind just wouldn't shut. That same feeling won't disappear. Getting back to sleep was hard, so I grab a book. The title reads - ""Terror On Tuesday"". But it's Monday, I say.

"If there was ever a woman in this world who was love incarnate, it was her. She passed in her sleep last night, after fighting this cancer for almost a year. 

I can’t talk, because as soon as I start, it’s like this unending word vomit. I touched her hand, I kissed her forehead- it was so cold. So, so cold. Every touch following has been like running my hands over cacti, but I need to keep some kind of brave face on because after all of this, all I want is to reach out and be held. 

A part of me wishes, selfishly, that if I was really going to die in October if I wasn’t found, if not getting those stitches really would’ve made the difference, that I would’ve been left where I lay. I am happy for every moment I have been able to have with her. It has been excruciating though to watch her struggle to breathe, begging to die- to not be able to go to the bathroom herself. Watching my family break down. Without her, life doesn’t really feel worth it. I know eventually it’ll be fine- a new kind of fine, different but better than now. But fuck if this isn’t hard. 

I saw the tears, almost encased like amber in the corners of her eyes. I remembered being unconscious, seeing nothing but ocean waves and moonlight, and hoped her passing was as peaceful as mine would have been. 

The two gentlemen who came to take her away were ill-equipped, and definitely not strong enough to carry her. My brother in law, mom, and the nurse had to help carry her down the stairs in that white fucking bag. My sister scrambled to my side as I started to sob, blurring out, “Oh, I fucking hated that.” Thank goodness Dad was on the phone in his room. He didn’t need to see how they carried her. 

I fell asleep on the couch after that. I sleep with my mouth open, like she did. Her mouth- it was open. Pop slept with his open too, though both of them fell asleep sitting, mine opens if I’m laying down even. Part of me wants to strap it shut. 

I dreamed that I helped a man with something, and him and his wife gave me $40,000 dollars or something ridiculous. Money we really need right now, and I tried to give it to Mom but she said to put it in some bank account to accrue interest. Some friend stole a little of it to try to pay off a debt, her small son had a credit card that somehow they were under on. I felt so conflicted. I wanted to help all around but how could I? 

Friends have reached out because of the Facebook post. I can barely stand to respond. It’s not something I can verbalize without writing a fucking book about it. 

I cried on the phone to the manager I called out to this morning. I have work tomorrow and part of me wants to go but I am so afraid I’ll break down again. I just wish they would’ve told everyone so everyone knew not to ask. I just don’t want to talk about it. I don’t want to hear the pity, I don’t want to see the sadness- there’s so much at home already where we all are dealing with the same thing. 

She had this calendar, I looked at it and realized she wrote down on each of us kids’ birthdays how much we weighed when we were born. She loved us so much. I remember her telling me how Dad gave her a reason to live, and then we did. 

I wanted to tell her before she died that my heart was breaking- a friend gave me a good line for it that describes well something to give her hope we’d be alright, that when your heart breaks it makes space for love to fill the cracks. I never got the chance. 

I can’t believe she’s gone. I can’t believe it. I just want her to hold my hand again. I want to argue who loves each other more. I want her back. Part of me feels like she’s with her sister now, and Pop, and it’s selfish of me to want- but she’d understand. I want her to sing Unforgettable one more time. I don’t care if she’s judgemental of how I cook, I want to ask her how to make the potatoes right again. I want to call her because Little House on the Prairie is on. I want to watch Downton Abbey with her and my parents (for probably the fifth time). I want her to bitch us out for being picky eaters.

I washed the dishes from dinner and stared at the chair she would’ve sat in. I listened to Nat King Cole and cried. 

I miss you, Nan. I love you. I love you more. I love you most."
"Today, I woke up. I immediately grabbed my phone. It's 6:30. I take a look at the window. It's still dark, but there's a little bit of light. It's dawn already. I haven't studied and have been sleeping for how many hours and didn't even get to eat dinner. I wanted to close my eyes again, knowing that it's gonna be another tiring day. I was thinking of not getting out of bed yet, with the thought of giving myself a few more minutes. Thinking about how time flew so fast. I just got to sleep and woke up knowing that you're out of time. Looking at the ceiling in deep thoughts, saying in my mind ""Can I take a break? Rest for a moment and stop time, I'm tired"". I could have enough sleep for many hours but still have a feeling of not having rested enough. Sadness begun to fill me up. And I start to remember my dream. It was vague. But I couldn't forget the sadness in it. It seemed that I was blind. I didn't know what was happening outside. I was falling. It was in slow motion. But as I fell on the floor I didn't feel anything. As if I was numb. And it felt really sad. In the end, my eyes were open, and realized what was happening right from the start. There was a picture of a girl, more like an animated drawing in a timeline. She has short hair and has an injury in her head. Maybe it's me or maybe it's someone else. I don't know. But it's sad.

I then realized that everything has something to do with something that you can never stop, change or alter. And that is ""Time"". 

And I should be happy that I have it. Without it, the first sentence that I said wouldn't be possible.

On the first place, it wasn't dawn yet. It was 6:30 in the evening. And I was only sleeping for just like 2-3 hours. I thought everything was too late, but it's not. Because I have ""Time"". And that's one of the things that matters most. You are never too late.

I've been wanting to cry for what it seems a very long time to me. But the tears won't come out. As if you have been numbed for everything that happened. It's likely before, but now, it seemed that I'm used to it so much that I can't get my emotions out anymore. I can't seem to get it right anymore. And it's sad. It's suffocating. 

Hoping that I could let it out this time, I talked to God. And it did work. I've been sorry for everything. And told Him how tired I am. And also felt sorry about it. Am I just being lazy? Have I not given my best and all? Did I do everything? Am I worth it? Is something wrong with me? Questions flew out my mind. And tears flew out my eyes. I'm tired. Can I just be with you in heaven and not have a worry in the world? Can I just rest, get a hug and be with you? I'm afraid of dying but existence just doesn't seem to feel like living happily anymore.

And in this world full of demand, happiness is what you need. To find for yourself, and to find yourself. And I was just lost. Lost in Time for finding Happiness. 

""Time must coincide with Happiness""

"Of all things, a youtube video made me realize something today. Maybe this ""downward spiral"" I've been in the last couple of, well, years, is due to me not knowing ""how"" to love.

I keep having flashbacks to a place I was almost 12 years ago. I was a lonely, angsty teenager; I'm almost 30 now, but I'm only now beginning to realize all that depression I had was mostly self-inflicted. Yeah, I had a shitty upbringing that didn't give me the best lessons for life, but I can't go back and change it. Just like I can't go back to that place 12 years ago...

What is that place? In the bed of a girl (now identifies as non-binary) on the other side of the country. We were teenagers. We were a couple that started out online, and we were now in the euphoric high of love when you can no longer think straight. It didn't help that our brains were fogged by frequent sex. Maybe that's what made it all the more intense; 4 days before, I had not known what having a friend was like. I thought I was on the spectrum (I now know I'm not). I was planning on visiting a complete stranger on the internet. People called me brave, but I still don't see it that way. 4 days later, I was in my own teenage romance novel feeling like the protagonist that finally ""won.""

This is the upteenth time I've posted this story on the internet. And why am I hung up on it? In part, because I screwed it up royally. Not only did I cheat, but I was being emotionally manipulative without knowing it. Hell, she even claims now that I sexually abusive too. I honestly still don't know if to believe that or not. All I know is that when I look back on it, I keep wanting to ""chase the dragon"" that was love. I'm hung up on a breakup that happened almost 8 years ago in my early 20s because I realized I was becoming a monster.

Since then, I've had multiple relationships (some short-term, others lasting years), but they almost all end up hating me. Yes yes, I know; If it smells like shit everywhere you go, maybe you should check under your own feet. The problem, as ""easy"" as it may sound, is not that I haven't seen that shit under my feet. Oh, I see it alright. The problem is, I don't know how to get it off. I've been married 2.5 years now to someone else. And these issues that I've yet to resolve are rearing their ugly heads yet again. Maybe I'm too hung up on relationships, maybe I finally need to do this ""finding myself"" thing everyone talks about.

Over the years, I've gotten bits and piece here and there about how to ""fix"" myself. I'm having trouble putting into words what exactly I'm going to do, but I'm gonna do it.

As you will see from my post history, I made this account with the purpose of pinpointing where I've screwed up in life so that I may finally fix it. If you choose to follow along, I hope to get some help in identifying where I've gone wrong and how to fix it. I need to get out of this spiral that I'm in right now.

\-DC"
"I just want it all to end already. I want to go back to a normal lifestyle. This entire pandemic has put everyone on edge. I can't even being to describe the amount of anxiety and somberness I'm feeling with each passing day.

My depressive symptoms are slowly creeping back. It's not major, but it's episodic and annoying to have. I've stopped exercising because I can barely move my muscles. Every now and then, I walk around the neighborhood with my N95-type mask on my face, but even that feels off. Yesterday, as I was walking for the first time in a while, it felt like a shot of adrenaline to be actually seeing people. 

The funny thing about all of this is that, years ago, I used to be such a hateful person. I had a heavy heart towards people, almost to the point of misanthropy. With these recent years, however, it's the exact opposite. I don't even wanna necessarily talk to people--just see them. 

I'm trying to look on the bright sides, such as not having a lengthy and miserable commute, and not having to deal with irate commuters pushing and shoving to get a good spot on the train or bus. In the end, however, I'd rather favor that any day than this miserable isolation.

I don't want to do anymore work. Doing data analysis and sitting by a computer is driving me insane. 

I'm burnt out from all of it."
"It's technically the 18th of April.  But only by 41 minutes at the moment.  41 minutes into tomorrow.  Today was productive. It was a good day. Went to 3 stores, bought supplies to make a raised garden. Kids built it and filled it all up. Got a bit of housework done. Forgot to write anything of worth, and I still need to make a family schedule. 


I wonder why I keep procrastinating this schedule. Like seriously. It's been like 6 months. A schedule will only be helpful and help us manage our time more efficiently. So, why haven't I made this happen yet? What am I waiting for?  It needs to include:


Bible time w/family


Bible time alone


Writing time


Cleaning time


School time without kids (curriculum/corrections)



School time with kids (teach/assign/help)


Food prep/eat/clean up


Play game with family


Time alone



Excercise (dancing?)




And so on and so forth.  I guess that's a beginning at least. Look there we go.  Progress 48 minutes into midnight of April 18th I I fleeping finally wrote down bare bones ideas.on what I want to include in our family on a daily basis.  



Yeah but, it's on reddit.  Is okay!  I can copy and paste!  Yah me!  Anywho,  I just wanted to write about a joyful normal day in quarantine. 



Part of me feels guilty we are so blessed in the midst of all this turmoil.  Husband gets paid admin leave, none in our family are sick, I feel like a Mama hen with all her chicks under beneath her.  Full of family and love it. We've never built a family garden before. Never had time. And now we do. 



We treasure each day, each breath.  I sang my family to sleep tonight. Took a video of it too.  That way, when I'm not around, my kids can still hear me sing them to sleep.  I'm finally starting to wind down. Writing does that for me sometimes. Settles me. I'm so thankful for writing.  Thanks diary.  Goodnight."
"I woke up to the sound of my mom raising her voice at my dad. She said something along the lines of, 

""You don't want your kids to see their mom?! You don't want me to see my mom?! SHAME ON YOU!""

Then she ran upstairs into her room, where she started screaming at the top of her lungs again. She did that for around 7 minutes, until she went back to my dad's room and started yelling at him. 

It has stopped for now though.

I don't know how much longer I can be isolating myself with my screaming parents and my sister, who is like a ticking time bomb.

(5:17 pm) Update: My parents got into another argument. My mom is screaming a bit, and it sounds like she's slamming doors.

(5:30 pm) Update: The screaming has stopped, and I'm pretty sure my mom left the house. I'm kinda sad now because I realized that nobody comforts me when all of this stuff is going on. I mean, I have one last older brother that lives at home, and he never checks in with me."
"There is a pain in my heart   
It's weird  
Almost not real   
I know I am in pain  
I know there is a void   
That wants to be filled   
But how?  
How I am feeling it in my chest?   
In the middle   
Where the rib-cage ends   
And the stomach begins   
This one spot, size of a fist   
It's pulling inwards   
Like a vacuum   
It wants something   
It's demanding something   
It's is sucking away   
Like an angry God   
Like a storm, a tornado   
It's taking everything   
Hoping something will satisfy him   
Something warm   
Like a soup in a winter night   
Like a warm hug from a lover  
Like the worm skin of hers   
Like kind words when you are running low  
Like a hug you are too afraid to accept  
It wants that   
Needs it   
Screaming for it  


It forgot   
It forgot how it feels to have it  
Forgetting the taste of it   
Forgetting how it feels  
It stopped wanting it   
Now my heart wants it again   
Demands it   
Not with rage   
But with fear   
Is it really worthy to ask? To demand?   
Can it ask for this anyways?  
What next?   
Will it make me weaker?  
If I taste it again?  
Will my dumpster food taste good  
If I eat a warm mean for a day?  
Dumpster is what I am certain for   
Why bother?  
Why develop a taste for blood?  
I might fall into the spiral again   
Why bother?   
Why? Because I want to  
Should I listen to my wants?  
I wish it was simple   
I know nothing   
I am getting more confused by the day  


I was getting a grip on things   
I got really good at being lonely   
Neediness   
I don't want to be needy anymore  
I don't want to start the next conversation   
Friends, girlfriends   
I am getting so tired of it  
I am tired of it  
Weakness, I thought   
Why no one wants me???  
Why only I am reaching out my hand?  
Every freaking time?  
Why?   
Am I not good enough?  
Am I not interesting enough?   
Why am I not wanted?   
Why?  
I had no answers  
I have no answers   
So I did that   
Got good at being alone   
I liked it   
I got good at it   
I cared about me   
Tried to be selfish   
Succeeded a bit too   
I got good at it   
I crawled out of that spiral   
That black forest   
Inch by inch   
Living for another day   
Sometimes hours  
Every night I thought  
""I can't do this anymore""  
Every morning I woke up   
""There is no help""  
""Help is not coming""  
My last hope   
There was no hand reaching out  
As I was reaching out mine  
Life is cruel   
It can be beautiful too   
If you are strong enough   
But I am not strong   
I crawled out of it   
That black forest   
I didn't know where I was going  
I just kept going   
Crawling   
On all fours   
Mud on my face   
Blinded   
Scared   
Full of anger and resentment   
One human was there   
She was there   
Not a lover   
Not a friend   
A human   
When I reached to the therapists office   
I thought I was safe   
No   
My last glimmer of hope  
The last candle with dimming light  
Went away just like that  
With no compassion   
With a cruel face   
I had no choice   
Suicide was waiting the other way   
She was there   
She does not talk to me no more   
I am no friend   
But I got out of there   
Crawled   
With tears in my eyes   
With mud that burns my eyes   
My lover was not there  
With whom I thought I would spend   
The rest of my life  
I was just a slave to her   
She my lover   
She my master   
I got out of there   
I stood up   
In the face of a cruel and rational face   
I stood up   
With my face begging for some affection   
I got none   
But I got up   
No one listened to me   
Or showed me mercy   
And I stopped hoping for it  
Expecting it   
I got out of there   


But my heart got the taste of it again   
From you   
It was close   
But opened up to you  
Willingly   
To feel   
To feel you   
To feel the touch of a lover  
And it did   
I did that willingly   
I allowed it for you  
I gave you a place in my heart   
And for the brief moment of time  
I felt the presence of the timelord   
We escaped him for hours  
Few times   
With the golden candle light on your face   
On your cheekbones   
We escaped from the timelord   
We stretched one hour to few  
And somehow it was longer than that few   
I guess   
Now I am paying my due   
Now that you are not there   
There is a void   
Like the black hole   
Like the tornado   
Now it's crushing down in itself   
It's feels cold there   
Below the rib cage   
It feels cold   
I think it itches   
But when I stop to be sure   
It does not   
It's an itch alright   
An itch I can't scratch by hand   
It''s under the skin you see   
It does not want my sharp pointy nails   
It wants a rub of warmth   
It wants to be fed   
It's hungry   
Oh I got so strong   
Now I am weak again   
For what?   
To feel?   
Was it it worth it?  
Was it?  
What's the other option?  
Hide away all your life to avoid getting hurt?  
Do you want to chose that road?  
Do you want to live life   
Without feeling that affection   
That hug from back   
I chose to feel   
Now I am paying the price   
I manged to stand   
Now I am lost  
Not knowing left from right   
Disoriented   
I will stand up again   
What else?  
What else is there?  
I knew it was gonna end soon  
I wanted it to   
Why?  
So that I don't get attached too much  
It ended sooner   
And I got attached   
She was never mine   
And never will be  
I told myself   
Couple of times a day  
I guess it did not do the trick  
As I expected   
No matter   
I wish I could make the tornado stop  
It's a funny feeling  
It tickles   
Not in a good way I am afraid   
She was never mine  
And never will be  
A traveler who you have met your way  
You are a traveler   
A nomad   
Bedouin   
Jajabor in my tongue   


A friend came over  
Asked me why I am wearing sunglasses   
In the night   
Something is wrong   
But I don't tell   
I am closing myself   
Remember?  
He doesn't ask   
No one cares   
He just wants to vomit himself out  
I am the tool  
I am always the tool   
Being there   
Where I found none  
I am the tool   
I am always the tool   


There is a storm in my heart   
As I talk to him   
I tell myself   
""Be here Sami""  
""Be here""  
But the storm keep rising   
I feel I cannot sit there anymore  
I want to run  
With my hands on my side   
My chest out   
I run   
Run   
Am I running from something?  
Or towards?  
I thought I had it together  


I wish I could cry   
I think it will make me feel a bit better  
But I can't   
""Real men don't cry""  
Are men not human?  
Am I not human?  
I can't cry   
I wish I could   
I wish I could cry my heart out  
As I scream an ugly scream   
To let it out  
It's trapped you see  
It's trapped   
It's trapped in me  
I thought I had it together   


I didn't have my dinner today   
Or the yesterday   
I make my food with great care   
Like a ceremony   
But I don't feel hungry anymore   
And I am not cooking   
Maybe I should   
Force myself   
Should I?  
Where is the line?  
When to force?  
When not?  
I don't know  
I don't know anything   


There is a storm in my heart   
I am trying to talk to it  
As I write each line  
Am I giving it more power?  
Or should I lock it away?  
Take a gulp and wash my feelings away  
When to do what?  
I do not know  
Am I trying to get sympathy  
From strangers?  
Oh I used to   
Am I still?  
As I am showering in my sorrow  
Trying to sound smart   
Brush my ego   
I do not know   
I do not know  
When should I be rational?  
Wash this away with logic  
And when should I pay heed   
And embrace it   
I do not know  


I am just a kid  
I didn't grow up  
I hide that kid in me  
I was so cruel to him   
Punished him for not being mature   
The kid gets hurts easily   
Now I try to protect him   
Give him a hug for the lost time   
Sometimes I wish I was an adult   
Less naive   
Less of a tool   
I am just a kid   


There is a storm in my heart   
I feel like I am gonna explode   
There is a cloud that surrounds me  
I cannot see clearly   
The things that I wrote   
I cannot see my rules  
Rules that I have written in my head  
Maybe a paper was a better idea   
Now I cannot see   
I am on the floor   
I need to get up  
I want to get up again   
I can't see clearly   
I can't seem to remember my rules  
The hard truths of life   
Your warmth made me soft   
Which I craved   
I leaned towards you   
Towards your warmth   
That I so craved  
Starving for so long  
I lost my balance   
I fell   
Now I am on the ground   
I leaned in too much   
I was afraid that was gonna happen   
That is why I wanted it end   
End soon   
It ended sooner   
But I already leaned too much   
I was scared   
Afraid   
Afraid to lose myself   
To put down my armor   
The armor that I built   
The armor I took off   
To give you a hug   
Too feel you in my chest   
Now there is a storm in my heart   


Is this the price to feel?  
Isn't the price too much?  
It feels like that   
He who has everything  
Will be given more  
He who has nothing   
Will have less and less   
The world is not a kind place  
Beautiful   
Only you are strong   
Strong enough to see it's beauty   
Strong enough to overcome your sorrow  
Strong enough to stand alone  
Strong enough to stand with head high  
And chest wide  
I was getting stronger   
Now I am weak   
I will be strong once more   


it's time to stand up  
With my chest wide   
Head high  
And tears in my eyes   
It's time to stand up high"
"Day 1,

I hate journals I think they’re pointless. Hopefully this helps me find some sort of happiness. I am going to use this to just word vomit everything... so I’m not stuck I feel less trapped in my head.

I downloaded two apps today; this one and coral.  Coral is an intimacy coach. It suggested I start a journal and once a day I should stand naked in front of a mirror. Then I should write down one thing that I like about myself.  I hate myself. Blah.

Do I really need an intimacy coach? What is that anyways? I went through some of the exercises and it literally walks you through sexual experiences. I can’t picture a real person doing that. 

How fucked up would that be?

“That’s good, Bob. Now, trying using a downward angle and monitoring the response of your partner.” Laughable.

What else am I supposed to write in this thing? My thoughts? My feelings? My goals? My fears? My achievements? It doesn’t mean anything anyways. Am I feeling better yet?

Ummm... I stood naked in front of the mirror because... why not? I like my eyebrows. Let’s check that off the list for today. They aren’t too big or bushy. I don’t need to really maintain them at all. The medial parts of my eyebrows flare up and out but not too much. I’ve always like that. I think that’s good enough.

I don’t want to go to work tomorrow. It’s such a drag. It’s not like my job is hard. I really don’t like hearing about everyone else’s anxieties and listening to people regurgitate what they hear on the news. COVID this... COVID that... blah. #essential

Our company cut hours and pay across the board. Most of us aren’t even considered “full-time.” We also aren’t getting our annual raises this year. #essential

My sister has been texting me the last couple days. It makes my skin crawl every time I see her name. She sent me pictures of these masks she made for work. As much as I didn’t want to look I felt like I had to. Kind of like when you squish a spider and you have to check that it’s dead. You just have to look. She is definitely someone I would watch get hit by a bus and then backed over again. Do I need to elaborate? Maybe not tonight.

Peace out, Girl Scout."
"So, things with Nat are not going well. Unfortunately. Really, it's sad. There were so much possibility. Not they are gone. What seemed to be sparks of a new year firework is now all but gone. It makes me really sad. There was so much possibility. Things died before it came to life. I made some mistakes, she made some, we made some, and the time and situation; and it died. It makes me sad really. I was telling this to one my friend, one that respect; he asked me, this possibility that died, was it really there? And he made a good point.

Things that died, it died because there was/is a 3rd person. She wanted to breakup with him even before we met. And still she can't let him go. Wow! Just wow! I thought I was enough for her to let her past go and start a new one. I thought I was special to her, as she was to me. Nah. I was not. I was not. It hurt me. I thought we had a lot of chemistry. She even told me so. She is a good person. Trying to do the right thing. I believed her when she said it. I chose to believe her later. Well, that was not the case it seems. I was not enough for her to let go of the past. Not only that my arrival in her life did not change her stance on breaking up with him any better. One can even say, I may have pushed her to him more. It hurts. It does affect my self-steem, which was low to begin with. I just started working on it and it took a hit so early. It's okay though, I did it once, I can do it again. It just hurts. I was not planning to have a long term relationship with her, I wanted to experience her as a person. Body and mind. I wanted to learn from her. I wanted partner up with her. And she said she was looking for something too. I thought she meant with me, turns out she didn't mean me (I am assuming). I wanted someone with whom I can fight irrationally, to whom I can say I need some strength today, can you spare me some? I wanted to experience a new person. I wanted to laugh with her. I wanted to watch movie with her. I wanted someone with whom I can talk philosophy with. I wanted someone with someone I can be insecure with. She told me she would like that as well. We said at the beginning, ""Please tell the truth, always"". I held my end of the bergain. She did not. She hid things from me. Important things, like she had a bodfriend for the first three weeks. Thank God at least she did tell. Although I think shed did not because of me but for her own consience. I don't mean to paint her in a bad picture. She is a good person. Even in this turmoil she supported me. Oh! I wanted someone who can support me in my journey of discovering myself/self-improvement/discovering life and someone whom I can support. She said she wanted the same. I thought she meant me. Nah. Yeah, I was saying, even in this turmoil she supported me. When I was down, she said ""I beleive in you"". It meant a lot to me. No girlfrield ever told me that. Usually it was the other way around. I was met with ""You are not a real man, why can't you do anything like that boyfriend"". And even after that I stayed. I lacked the minimum self-respect to leave. I was foolish. I was naive. I was made to beleive I am responsible for their life. And I beleived it. I am better now, it took 10 years or so. But I am better now.

Today makrs the 3rd month since our first date. After some abusive relationship she was/is the first woman I have met with whom I could have normal, even a healthy relationship. I was so afraid of sharing myself with another person again that I marked my calender to check on this relationship I was getting into. Here I am responding to my call; a call out of fear of losing myself in nother person. I was starving for some affection, some warmth, some physical touch. I was starving. I was starving. She did give me some ounce of that. I found that a bit in her. The starving self in me, the one who was so thirsty of that got some of that from her. I felt like a man after a long time.

I am sad, I am sad. For what it could have been, and never will be. Like my friend pointed out, maybe it was never there to begin with. Maybe I am sad over something that was never there. I am sad. It came so close to me and got away. It saddens me. I need to pull back. I opened up after a very long time, to her and to my friends. Both are not there anymore. Maybe Iam too much for them. Maybe. I belive I was/am too much for my friends. And for her, I was not enough for her. She told me, I am the third person with whom she can open up; the other two being her best friends. I thought I was special. I was not. I was not. I hugged her tightly. With my heart. I knew it was gonna end soon. I wanted to end it soon. But I did not think it will end before it even started.

What am I trying to say? I do not know yet. Just rambling here in didgital paper. Hopeing it will be able to show me something. I really should read this after few days. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Be sad my friend. Be sad. Hug yourself. Pull back. You were full closed up/down. Then you switched to too much open up mode. In this spectrum, be 30% open up instead of 100% that you are right now. Because of opening up, we are hurt right now. We are feeling so lonely after a very long time. Something we thought were past us. Something we thought we took care of already. But also ""In order to feel something we need to risk getting hurt"", see? We felt something and we got hurt. Both comes together my friend. We can't have one without the other. It's okay my friend. We opened up, we got some warmth, we got some love, got to feel the warmth, we also got hurt. Now we adjust, pull back. 30% open up. We can do it. We have done it, and we shall do it once again. That's the human story my friend. For a short moment we felt like a victory. We felt like we are flying in the sky. We felt the hug from behind. It's okay my friend. Next time we hopefullly will know better. Hopefully. That's it. Yeah, that is it. What else is there. Nothing. We try, we fail, we suceed, we learn, we adjust, we move on.

It's okay my friend. We got this. I hope your heart heals. I hope your heart gets a bit better. It is okay. It is okay. Be sad. We are strong. We are motherfucking strong. It's there. It's there. We need to dig deeper, again. We got this. We got this."
"Hello there!

So lately, past six months or so, I've been having increasing feelings that I should have breasts.  I guess the best way to describe it is something missing, while I have something that shouldn't be there in my crotch.  

I've had that feeling for a long time.  But it would come and go.  I'd feel that way briefly, and then not again for a long time.  Days, sometimes weeks.   But lately it's been stronger and it doesn't really go away.  

I've been considering getting a gender therapist, to see what's going on.  I'm kind of afraid that they'll push me or try to lead me to transition, and that's not what I want.  I know therapists have rules and ethics, but I'm scared.  I'm scared of outing myself and there are times I log into reddit and can't believe I'm doing it here.  

It's been bad this weekend.  I will try to talk to my wife about it, but sometimes those conversations don't go the way I want them.  I get it.  She signed up for one thing, and didn't know how I was until, well, it was too late.  That's on me, and I accept that.  I can only say I didn't know how to tell her at the time.  Didn't have the internet and the support of others.  

Time to go eat some Easter food."
"Dear Diary.

I'm tired, diary.  Oh lord am I tired.  I was listening to music as my day is winding down and the SotD came on, and the line ""How long must I climb up this mountain of mine?"" was sung, and suddenly I was exhausted.  

I often compare myself to Sisyphus, and having to push that rock up the hill.  It's a weight I carry, and it's dragging me down.  Pushing me down, and as soon as I get to the top I seem to get pushed back down again.  

I like to think I'm not sliding back down to the bottom of the hill.  I like to think it's more of a 'one step forward, two steps back' kind of thing.  Might be three back, or four back.  But what keeps me going, and what I take a small measure of comfort in, is that I don't give up and I keep going.  I keep pushing forward, hoping that this next hill won't be so bad. And knowing that I can keep going up these hills.  

I've almost given up a few times, but in the end I haven't.  I manage to keep going.  That validates me. I won't say anything as trite as I see the cloudy skies clearing, or the slope isn't as bad.  But I like to think they are.  

SotD: *The Speed of Sound*"
"So, it's 4 am and I wake up to the sound of my dad yelling.

After listening to some of his yelling I can conclude that he thinks my brother(19) is gay because one of his friends picked him up at 4 am to get McDonald's.

He's just been actually *crying* at the fact that he's out with a friend at 4 am. 

He also thinks that my brother might be gay. Because he's out with a friend at 4 am.

My opinion on this is that my brother is a legal adult, so if he wants to get up at 2 or 3 or 4 in the morning to hangout with one friend, then he has absolutely every right to do so.

Is he being a bit stupid by not social distancing? Yeah, but at least he's only hanging out with one  person, and not a whole group of people like I've seen in social media."
"Dear diary,

&#x200B;

Today I realized something important. Sometimes you map things out delicately, step for step, to get from point A to B. And whenever you get thrown off route, you do everything to steer back onto the road. And what I thought would be a smooth ride to Cloud 9, turned out to be more or less a highway to Hell. But it's okay! We fell along the way, we stumbled and falled, had disagreements and realisations, ultimately bringing us where we are now. Our journey brought me so many insights and a new friend in you, and I couldn't be more thankful of that. It's okay that my destination didn't match up with where we ended, for as long as you're still with me on this road, I don't really care where it leads."
"Our governor just declared a shutdown throughout the state. I'm not technically allowed to leave my house unless it's to get groceries, or gas for my car. Not like I'm going anywhere, anyway. I'm still working out of home.

This is driving me insane. I'm going to get severe cabin fever by the end of the month. Exercising isn't really helping, even though it somewhat gets some of my brain to drain from all this stress. This is what inmates must feel like.

I've been cut off from my stuff from the lab, obviously, and I can't do anything but data analysis. Making graphs and plotting a bunch of data points is boring. I'm still getting paid, but it doesn't really feel like work to me. Yeah, I know, I shouldn't sound so whinny. Like I said in my previous entry, I'm lucky to have not get laid off...yet. I really hope that grant holds up for the entirety of this crisis.

I heard that company nearby is accelerating their efforts into finding that vaccine. I don't fully understand it, but it basically has to do with introducing mRNA into our cells to make a specific protein (""spike protein"") to mimic a viral infection for our white blood cells to make antibodies. That's the gist of it, but I'm not an immunologist so I can't say what the exact science is. I hope it comes out sooner than later. 

I'm particularly worried about my father. He's in his 60's, and while it's been confirmed the virus doesn't discriminate age, he's in with the more vulnerable patients in our population. He's always been a stubborn ass, but hopefully he'll actually listen because of this brouhaha going on.

I've also been reading about the drug studies regarding the anti-malarial drug, and the antibiotic primarily used to treat pink eye, azithromycin. Apparently it has some kind of synergistic effect to fight off the infection, but how it exactly works or how safe it is, is beyond me. They were also talking about investigating into the use of an antiviral med that's used for the Ebola virus. Anyway, this is beyond my league of expertise, so I'll leave it to the pros to explain it to me in time.

I hope this ends sooner than later, but on a better note. 

I feel tired."
"If I try to recall my day, I can recall picturing how I look like from an outsider point of view, or just to others. I spend alot of time doing this, and I want to stop. Do you get me? What i'm saying? Like, i can be using my phone or walking down the street but i'm not thinking about anything else other than picturing how I look like walking down the street or using my phone. I dont know if its normal, and even if it is, I want to stop."
"I have never gone hungry. 
I have never had to work for a living yet. 
I go to school and have no loans.
I have never received a proper beating.
I go on nice vacations with my family. 
I do not have any money issues. 
I am a stupid, lazy, spoiled, sheltered, ungrateful brat. 
Everything is my fault.
If I died right now, it would still be my fault.
I will never be able to do anything right in my life and no one should feel sorry for me because I am a spoiled, ungrateful, sheltered brat.
I will never be valid because everything terrible that happens around me is my fault.
I'm crazy, evil, stupid, and worthless.
I wish I received beatings just so someone would feel bad for me.
I think about killing myself but that would just be another selfish thing that I do.
I deserve to be in a hole or an insane asylum where I can be tortured everyday and no one will have to think about me.
I am a burden to everyone who loves me.
I am terrible to people who love me.
I am not deserving of love.
I wish a murderer kills me or a meteor falls on my head, but these thoughts also terrify me. (Which makes me a pussy)
I want to be better but I never will be.
I am doomed to be a terrible, angry, sad person for my entire life.
I am going to hell when I die."
"Something I have no control over that gives me joy gives me the most anxiety. I feel like if I knew I would just optimize that, but instead I don’t know. I could lose whatever she loves about me tomorrow and lose her as well. 

What is there about me to love? I’m socially awkward, kiss awkwardly, miss signs all the time, am a dork, have little experience, and am average looking. I genuinely can’t see what qualities of mine anyone would fall for, I had always assumed that i would end up alone, but here I am. There’s literally nothing to me, who could be so foolish to fall for a guy like me?"
"Hey! I'm proud of Eminem.

I had a blast today. Did some good work at work, then went to a meeting, saw this girl I had a crush on who DENIED me. I smiled and was friendly and noble, for that is what I really am. I was very happy to arrive to the group - I saw lots of faces I haven't seen in a while. Plus, I needed it.

Got home, did some other thing, had dinner and texted a while. It's almost 9:30 pm now and I'm already tired - I stayed up late last night to talk to my sponsor.

&#x200B;

I feel like, sure, this ain't interesting - but yeah my life has no drama lately and it's quite fun. I did discover this truth though:

&#x200B;

And that's it. I try to be consistent. I know writing helps, but usually a pen and a paper is what actually helps me, what I need. I just remembered there's a book I'm translating and I seem to have some free time right now. Ok. Bye."
"So, a few minutes ago I was downstairs and I was getting a ziplock bag. I happened to be in the way of my sister. My sister then says, ""Great placement, huh?"" In an angry tone.

I didn't reply to her. I simply moved out of the way. 

The my sister says, ""You should really take people into consideration."" In an angry tone, again.

I ignored her the entire time, and I haven't spoken to her for the *entire day* 

My sister did acknowledge the fact that she had anger issues, but she's not trying to get any better, and that frustrates me so much.

I don't know how I'm going to live with this. It actually makes me really scared because I don't know what type of mental issues I'm going to have in the future, when I'm an adult."
"So my SIL called about an hour or so ago to catch up with her Bro (my husband) and she gave the news that she's 5 weeks (or months... I only heard his side of the conversation) along and she'll know what the gender of the baby is going to be next week or so.

He's elated, and super excited to meet his new niece or nephew.

I, on the other hand, don't give a flying fuck. Big deal, you got knocked up (she's married so I'm just being crass here) and I'm glad that you both make a shit ton of moolah to afford a kid. My husband has to pull in 55+ hours a week to make sure that we don't go belly up, and we owe about $5000 total in debt. And yeah, those numbers aren't nearly as scary as those with student loan debt, or hospital debt (F) but I'm over here wondering how that side of the family is going to rope me into babysitting or some bs. Because they only call when I can do something for them, as my husband works too much to be able to be consistent in child watching duties.

As I've sat and contemplated the weight of having children in an age where facts don't matter and the planet is becoming a flaming cesspool and I'm not making any more money than I was 3 years ago. Not only do I have to worry about the financial burden that a child is, but I have to worry about weather or not my child will get shot up in school as it's like every other week that we hear about one. Aaaaand I'm not going to teach our kids about God (or rather I'll tell them all the facts about the church, and how pedophiles hide in plain sight, they steal money, and teach shit based on faith and personal experiences.) and science is not going to be ""optional"" in my house. This issue comes into play as we live in an area where most if not all of the schools are owned and operated by churches... But that's a whole other point. Not to mention life is a curse, because no matter what we do, death awaits us all, I'd rather not burden someone who had no choice in the matter over 10 to 30 mins of rolling around getting sweaty, stinky, and wet.

So good for her, I'm glad that she's doing what she wants. But I'm not going to sit here and blow smoke up her ass and be like, OMG That's amazing! Big deal, your hubby didn't pull out. Oooh.

And this isn't just a disdain for my SIL, I would've reacted to any one of my friends announcing the same thing. I like kids, like don't get me wrong. As much bitching that I've done here, I don't dislike kids. I just find that the card stack is incredibly high for myself, and I'm not going to be excited over something, that's frankly mundane.

But yeah, my husband's like, why can't you just be happy for them?

Because I'm not happy for them. Big fucking deal. I guess I'm the asshole. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
"For a couple of years, I have wished and endured. For a progress of time, I have won and failed. However, happiness was and still is never reached. 

To the concept of lookism, I am deemed as unattractive and in regular-statement, ""ugly."" I lean among the features of plain, which is further enhanced from the words of family members, friends and strangers. As a result, my stance against mirrors become ill-versed. My personal reviews alienate my face and body. The disgust and disturbance towards my appearance becomes physical and emotional pain. My face becomes stretched and bloated. My body becomes wider and irritated. I cry. 

However, the concept of sadness and opinion of self should be disrupted. The argument, which continues constantly, is that 'looks don't matter.' The argument is, is that I should ignore self-identity in order to overcome obstacles for my family. The duty of a first-generation daughter should overcome education and enter a well-funded career. The duty of a sister is to take care of a disabled brother whose childhood was both sweeten and torn. The duty as a family-member is to take care of my blood-line in order to repair and stabilized connections. There is no room for me to be me. For me to become sad, mad or sentimental. I cry. 

I cry for the child-self, whose love was mostly attentive to her brother. The child-self who was flooded with justifications of her brother's wider love and pride. The child-self who was drown with comparison among smarter, more creative and prettier students. I cry for the teen-self whose depression generated weight-gain. The teen-self who overturn mental and physical abuse. The teen-self who found comfort under the mound of rocks and darkness. The teen-self who ignored herself because that was the solution of running away from thoughts of others, the opinions of others and the criticism of others. The teen-self whose identity could not be constructed and eventually, became lost. The teen-self whose favorite phrase was ""I'm Sorry."" I cry to the present-self realizing that she could not rebel against her past. The present-self who wishes for change. The present-self who continues for the attention and love of family members. The present-self who childhood still revolves her mind. The present-self who can not fulfill the duty of an adult. 

&#x200B;

Towards the subject of beauty, I am ruled under ugliness. 

Towards the subject of intelligence, I am crowned average. 

Towards the subject of me, I question me ."
"So, a few minutes ago I went downstairs to get some dinner and a cup of water. My sister was standing in front of the fridge, so I said, "" excuse me""

And my sister opened the fridge door on herself and said, ""See? It's not that hard."" In a rude voice

Then she repeatedly says, ""Get the fuck out of my face."" 
And, ""You're not suppose so use the bathroom."" 
And, ""Even mom agrees you're wrong.""
And, ""You're sooo smart."" In a mocking tone.

Also, earlier today I went to my second therapy appointment, and my therapist advised me to apologize to my sister so we could start improving, but idk how I can do that. I was really considering apologizing, but it'll probably start an argument.

And another thing is that I only got 20 minutes with my therapist because at the beginning of the appointment my mom came into the room with me, then she asked me to step outside, into the waiting room, for a whole 20 minutes. So that's pretty annoying.

I just want all of this to end.


(8:24PM) Update: around 2 hours ago my mom called me down to talk with my sister. We talked about the ""incident"" and about how we were both in the wrong. My sister admitted to having issues because of my dad.

I want to say sorry, but I'm scared of getting hurt again. My sister bullied me in the past and apologized for that, but she verbally abused me last month, and it makes me scared."
"Heloo, today was Saturday so as any teenager I didnt wake up until 10 and wasted most of my day on youtube or on the xbox. I really need to start working on the YouTube addiction :/. Apart from that I walked my dog ruby in the for once good weather. I set fire to some old text books and magazines that were taking up space in my room and well thats it really. I doddnt really do anything else productive. I made pizza for tea which was quite nice but yeah that's it. 

I spoke to the girl today. Nothing deep nothing flirty nothing about anything important. Just a friendly convo, as much as it hurts to think about what could have been I still think she is a really cool person and I still want to he friends.

It's made me a little happier knowing that she doesn't want to completely cut contact with me and was happy to just talk. Its gonna take a while but hopefully I'll eventually get over this crush

Sorry for being a short boring one goodnight I have to go and watch the storm outside my window

"Its been some time since I visited this sub.
Weekdays are hectic and weekends are boring. I have no idea what I am doing with my life.

All I do is work on weekdays and sleep/insta/fb on weekends. 

I like a girl in office as she seems my type but never got a chance to strike a conversation.
Tinder and Bumble seems too boring and shallow.

I want so many things- love, money, materialistic things. But i am not working on either of them. Well only money seems to be the thing I am working on."
"I passed my exam, I even passed it with a high mark. I wrote that I was afraid I was going to fail it but I didn't.

I want to write today a list of all my fears and things I think will happen in the future:
-I will die from cancer or by suicide
-I won't find a good job and even if i find it I'm going to be fired for poor performance
-After I finish with school I will be all alone and lose contact with my classmates
-I will have to give a speech
-I will never marry and even if i do i will end up divorced
-if i'll have a child i won't be able to take care of him
-exchange rate won't go up and i'm going to lose money"
"Just like in the dream I had yesterday.

It was dark. I woke up to my family screaming.

A huge robot was destroying my house.

I watched my family die.

I wish it was the first time my brain conjured imaged such as that. In my dreams - nightmares, more appropriately - I've watched every person close to me die. In a few cases, I've died. In the most haunting ones, my boyfriend has died. To my horror, I can't forget one dream I had where he died. It was right in front of me. He looked terrified.

I wish my dreams weren't so vivid. I wish I could forget them."
"Hello reader!

I use Reddit for a while now but never posted something, maybe because I'm from German and my english isn't that great when it comes to 'talking' or maybe because I never had something to write/talk about. But now I feel like it would be a good time to start.

&#x200B;

Today I started with sports again, I did a run and later a small workout will follow. I'm kinda proud I stared with sports today again, but also scared. I was anorexic for over 11 years, since 2 years I have a normal weight again and lived without  hospitalization but everytime I started with my workouts and stuff, I carry it too far and nearly got THAT sick again. I guess I'll see how it will end this time. For now I try to just keep thinking the healthy way, I learned so much about me the last two years, maybe it will be enough this time!

&#x200B;

Also, do we use hashtags on Reddit? How does Reddit even work in general lol?!"
"
Family means everything. You’d never want to leave your family. You think they’re crazy but you’re the crazy one for wanting to go anywhere without your family. Your family is love. Your family is life. Your family is always there for you. 

But where were they when you were so alone? Where were they when you were slowly dying? Where were they when you lost interest in your faith. In your friends. In your life. Where were they? You have so many family members. Where did they all go? They sat on the side and watched quietly, when they’re always so loud. But they never sat on the side when you had events. When you need to look up and see them there. They never watched your games. They loved everyone else’s... but where did they go? 

They left you in the dark. They left you alone. They left you to wither away. How did they react? They barely blinked. They called you sick. They called you lazy. They said something had to be wrong in your head. But they didn’t help. 

You found comfort in the only friend you knew. You poured out your heart and soul for years and years until she knew everything about you. And how to use it against you. She told you you were being manipulated by them. But she was doing the same. Turning you against them. Until one day you had enough. You bought the one way ticket, to move across the country. 

There’s your family! The ones who called you crazy. They’re finally all here! But the way they act. The way they look at you. It’s anger and disgust. It’s sadness. Heartbreak. How could you, they’d say. How could you ever leave your family? They call you crazy. They think they’re horrible. That they did a bad job. That it’s their fault. 

They scream at you. They cry at you. Then they think it’s your fault. That you’ve changed. That you’re possessed. They think that you’re insane and they don’t waste any time telling you. And then, you’re gone. You’re finally going to figure everything out!

And then, you find him. This man who doesn’t think you’re insane. Who doesn’t think you’re mental. Who doesn’t care if you’re broken. And he helps fix you. He’s your better. 

Friendships end. Times change. New relationships start. You found everything out. You found your happiness. You found your life could be so much better then you ever imagined. You found your confidence. You found your cure. You found yourself. You found your home. You found your family. 

And family means everything."
"Sometimes, with deja vu or when listening to certain songs, the weight of nostalgia will appear. Like a warm and heavy blanket that will suffocate you as you enjoy its comfort. I find these times pull me back to my college years. Most often it isn’t memories of drugs and parties, but of past women and friends and, most frequently, the long nights at Randal before an exam or a paper’s deadline.

At times it would feel as if the instrumental music in my headphones guided my fingers. Hours would swiftly pass, aided of course by the strong dosage of ADD medicine (hey, I’m diagnosed).

Skating around campus on smoke breaks with a spliff, often with little mike. We would sit on the bench overlooking the pond in the nature reserve. I didn’t appreciate my time then, and I fear I’ll never feel so full again.

&#x200B;

I’ll never write something of my own content that will be suitable for anything other than mockery.

&#x200B;

I was a quiet child. It seemed as everyone around me could talk and move so effortlessly, like individual fish moving in synchronization with the school to produce the larger picture. But it isn’t effortless for us all. When I wasn’t dwelling in my own thoughts I would try to observe and mimic the interactions of those around me to better learn how to swim with the school.  And I’ve gotten pretty damned good at it. At the start, my efforts would often lead to mockery and cringes from my peers. My awkward inexperience was naked for all to see. And they did see.

But as time passed I began to understand the ebbs and flows of conversation. What other people expected of me and what I should expect in return has become progressively less murky as the years pass. But sometimes, maybe even most times, my own knowledge of my mimicry make its inevitability exhausting. Much like fish, humans need to keep moving to breath and survive. And thought of rest becomes ever more appealing with the dawn of each day.

Conversations in life, especially at work, grind over the same topics over and over until the subject is like a polished stone. One speaks a sentence while the other waits without anticipation to respond.

I've never believed in astrology. My birthday would categorize me as a Gemini, but I live the life of a dozen people rather than two. Personality archetypes come and go as the situation fits, and they feel comfortable occupying my mind and skin. Whether it's the hero or the victim, a socialite or a recluse, I'll unwittingly fit the role as if that were the man I woke up as every morning.

I don't know if you're trying too hard or not trying at all.

"Sometimes I feel like screaming at a barista's face when they put sugar in my morning coffee. Most times I don't. I am aware that it isn't the end of the world, or even really that annoying. Today, I chased a similar thought down a rabbit hole, what I would say if I really want to hurt someone. Then I wondered: what would psychological self-harm look like?

""Sometimes despair is just a state of mind, not a disease. Sometimes you need to get your teeth punched in without prior warning.

Maybe you're not all you think you are, maybe you're projecting your ideal into your reflection, creating a feedback loop of amplifying ordinariness. Maybe there isn't anything special about you at all. Maybe, just bloody maybe you're a regular person. Maybe you're even less than that, maybe what you call a special day, your childhood bully calls Tuesday. Maybe you're 10 is his 2. Perhaps you're not as smart as he is. Perhaps he would laugh at you if he sees you these days, assuming you remotely resemble a thing to be noticed. Maybe he bullied you because you needed it. It is not entirely impossible that pain is weakness leaving the body and he was trying to make a man out of you.

Maybe you're just a bad specimen. You don't work as hard as most people, and you're not as strong willed. Maybe you are just an inferior breed of human. It's a good thing you don't have children because if you did they'd spread your vile seed, sickening the human genome and diluting the average IQ of the population. It's good that you've never really been loved because if had you been loved it would just mean you lied about everything. How could you not? For another person to even tolerate being in your miserable presence you ought to act against every instinct you have.

I bet you like being this way. You enjoy being a pussy, you adore the sense of victim-hood. It gives you an excuse for your wretched existence, it gives you someone or something to blame. The perfect reason for you to be resentful. You can get away with hating the world because it hasn't been nice to you. But it isn't the world, it is\* just you"""
"When u are sad for no particular reason but possibly for everything wrong in your life and don't feel like sharing it with anyone. That sadness, that lack of energy is depression. Good i found this subreddit atleast i can write about it."
"Dear Teddy,

I'm losing a friend. Not to death or sickness but at work. It's really lowering my morale. She was the only person I trusted whole heatedly. The person always in my corner. I'm tearing up just thinking about not eating lunch with her. 

We started our careers together. We have gone through super highs and super lows within our lives and within our work environment together.

It's officially too toxic at work. Even for me. And I get it, I really really do. It just hurts as it becomes another reason for me to leave. I'm proud of her though. 

I don't know what comes next, I can't see the end in sight with my partner gone. I'm afraid we will have the lowest data we've ever had and somehow I'll be blamed.

It's only the second day back and I'm already drowning. I'm tired of teaching kids to be robots and I'm tired of being a puppet.

Sorry, I wish I had more positive things to say.

Goodnight,

-Aces"
"I really can't afford to live anymore. No, I'm not going to plan my suicide. I put that idea aside a long time ago.

Financially speaking, I don't know if I'll ever be on track. I allow myself to buy groceries and go out to fast food maybe 1-2 times a week and that's it. I don't go do things. And I still seem to not be able to catch up.

I can budget to hell and back, but the interest rates from cards I maxed out as a teenager will never allow me to catch up. I tell myself, maybe I'll get a new job or some miracle will happen. Probably not. I can hope all I want to. 

People don't understand what poverty is like. It's lonely. I'm busting my ass. Fuck it all."
"This is my first time keeping a diary, so I'm just going to copy and paste the whole thing. It's not very well written, as I just wanted to share this as unfiltered as possible and will only be editing names.  


Begin

 

I'm starting journaling today, I've felt like I should start this for a long time but I decided today was the day I'd start acting on it. Today is the day I'm starting to act on a lot of things. 

The other morning\[Some time between 4:34 AM 4:55 AM 12/21, likely in the first half based on when I typed something in response to the following incident in my match\] I was in the middle of a gaming binge, alone in one of the voice channels of Ryan's discord when to my pleasant surprise\[need to work on wording here\], Ryan joined the channel. We had some semi-dry small talk which led to him asking me how work was. 

The question caught me off guard. I skipped work that day, just as I told Doug I wouldn't the day prior, and therefore the answer to ""how was work?"" was that I didn't work at all. However, over these last few years I've developed a penchant\[that word just crossed my mind and I googled it so now I'm using it\] for lying whenever it could get me out of a rough situation, and I wasn't keen on having a conversation about the fact I've been skipping work to play league, or sleep to recover from playing league, so I answered, ""fine"", ""I did some stuff"", ""wrote some code"", or something to that effect.

I thought that my clever fib would put an end to me being questioned about work but unfortunately, Ryan pressed on trying to have a real conversation and asked ""what time did you get in?"" Immediately I felt a great deal of stress because: one; I had to think about what a reasonable time for me to make up was, seeing as I had to take into account the current time(which I was completely unaware of), the time that I was supposed to be at work(8:30, but I haven't been there on time in so long that I could just as easily change what time that was at that moment as I do when I lie to myself so I can sleep in), and the amount of time that I should be working. The calculations were difficult\[wording\], and I came up with 1:00. Yet the man kept pressing and then decided that if he was going to ask when I got in, it was only fair that he also ask when I got out of work. My brain couldn't make the necessary calculations fast enough, and the stinging sensation in my chest was getting more intense, so I was forced to concede. ""I don't know,"" I answered. I gave the worst possible answer, a textbook lie, something you'd expect a kleptomaniac toddler to answer when asked where they got that Snicker's. 

Being caught in my lie jarred me, not just because Lucas knew I was lying, but because I knew I was lying. I am a liar. I was a liar? I will be a liar no more? I suddenly became aware of the fact that I was  lying to one of my only friends. Then I realized that I myself am a liar, I've been lying to my team about why I've been missing about work, I've been lying to my family, really everyone about school, work, money, pretty much everything that I was struggling with. 

The reason that I was lying, I realized, wasn't really to protect myself, but to protect my addiction. If I don't tell people about the mistakes I'm making, about the circumstances I've put myself into due to my addiction, then they won't make me do anything about my addiction. Mom I haven't been not turning in my homework because I've been staying up every night playing league, I've just been working late on my homework but it's so hard and so stressful that I can't finish it.  I haven't been failing my classes every semester of college because I spend almost every waking moment playing league, thinking about league, watching videos about league, and scrolling through reddit threads about league. I've been failing my classes because I have seasonal depression. I didn't miss work today because I was up all night playing League, I didn't miss work at all Lucas.

After lying about the same thing for so long to everyone else, I started to lie to myself to turn down the cognitive dissonance. But, in acknowledging in that moment that I was a liar, I was forced to acknowledge what I was lying about, having a gaming addiction. Forced to admit that to myself, I typed in chat ""This is my last game of league of legends, playing against Skarner top has ruined league of legends for me"" as a joke, finished the match I was in(it would sound much better if I didn't) and uninstalled League. I then showered, got ready for my aunt's graduation, and went to my parent's to make sure I didn't sleep in, and slept from about 6:30 to 8.

The day of her graduation wasn't very significant, I begrudgingly got up, slept on the way to pick up my aunt, and slept on the way to the graduation. During the graduation I thought about how I don't know what it's like to have academic achievements anymore, and about how I won't be able to go to a graduation ceremony at a prestigious university and feel fulfillment and pride in my actions in school due to me ruining my academic life with my gaming addiction. I was pretty down and in my feels about that during the graduation, and after the graduation at Food Restaurant until we left and I slept in the car on the way back. 

When we got back to my parent's\[probably around one or two\] I went into my room/the guest room and slept until like 6 or 7. My mom woke me up to eat dinner with them, however I wasn't hungry so I didn't eat at first, even though they tried to make me. It made me think about whether or not I have an eating disorder, I felt a lot of pain in my stomach, but didn't exactly feel hungry, and I was concerned about how many calories were in the food. After weighing myself later I realized I was still 196, which is around the same weight I was when I weighed myself about a week ago. I've been eating out lately and ordering super unhealthy large meals like I was in the summer of 2019 so I wasn't sure if I'd gained weight or not.

I stayed for probably another hour or two, maybe longer, sitting around, watching some Samurai Champloo and an episode or two of Cowboy Bebop while my family hung out with the Parises(minus Channing because apparently he was throwing a fit) then I went home and decided to clean my room up, do some laundry, do the dishes, make some mac and cheese and hot dogs, and start working on Flex(my productivity app). I probably went to bed at like 1, and went to sleep at about 3 after watching some shows and doing some stuff on my phone. I'm unsure of whether or not that was wrong, and how much media I should consume, or really how I should interact with media at all. Also I sent Lucas a snap message and told him I'm sorry for lying to him about work, and told him I've been missing or late to work lately because I've been playing League too much. It felt really good to be honest about my problems, I felt the tingling sensation in my chest afterwards, and to try to resolve the conflict I'd cause by lying to him. He replied in the morning and said, ""I'm not sure if you meant to send this to me or not but I should just fix my sleep schedule"".

Today I got up at like 1 I think, after my mom facetimed me to come over. I smoked some, switched my laundry from last night, smoked some more, used mouthwash, and went over to my parent's for family Christmas. I had a bunch of energy, I felt the tingly sensation the whole time. I was much more sociable than the day before, but I still went downstairs and watched Samurai Champloo here and there. 

Some random things from the Christmas dinner:

Dudebro had moved out to his new place.

Dudebro couldn't ride with his parents because they told him he had to be later than he did so they left.

Grandparents picked up Dudebro after Sister asked them to. She and I asked my mom to ask them to

They said that he got to his place and he wasn't there.

Then Dudebro surprised us and came

Before I knew Dudebro couldn't come, I texted him and said ""I wish you came, not saying that to guilt you, just want you to know that we enjoy being around you""

After Christmas dinner I left and came home to work on Flex. I looked up ""personal management apps"" to see if similar things existed, and I found Clickup. I updated the idea file to call Flex a ""personal management app"" and then logged in to my github profile to get the repository started. I felt that tingling in my chest again when I saw my old projects. I felt a bit of fond nostalgia, looking back, but moreso I felt regret and sad nostalgia because I realized that every single project was last updated before I built my gaming PC, except for the one that I cloned from UIUC's repository Freshman year. What this meant, is that every single project I had on github was from either before I got into my PC gaming addiction, or from something that was a direct consequence of my actions before I developed my gaming addiction(the project that I cloned from the school I was only able to get in to  because of the work I did up until senior year when I got my PC.) This really made me realize how frozen I have been ever since I developed my gaming addiction and I immediately decided that I was going to journal this, use clickup to be more productive, develop my personal management app, make a reddit post about this experience, make multiple reddit posts about this experiences, talk to people on omegle about this experience, I just had an intense rush of energy. Partially because I felt I needed energy to do all of the things I needed to do, and partially because it showed me that my stagnation really was a direct result of my gaming addiction, and that I will start to fructate as a result of me putting an end to my gaming addiction.

Now that I've journaled my current situation, and the events leading up to it, I will end this night by posting on reddit, getting my project on github,  showering, brushing and flossing, doing my laundry, and going to bed."
"Happy birthday to you, you great rock of our family. Long may you live and make it more solid such that no mother or sister-in-law may break our bond. I love you forever and I'm immensely grateful to have you completing my life on a daily basis."
"During Chemistry class last December 5, I was pondering about what I did to these certain people. I mean, these actions I did were more helpful than harmful, but they still blame me. 

Basically, these people were bullies who well, bullied people including me. And this started three years ago. They started bullying me two years ago, and I decided to ignore it until they started rubbing it in my face that I wasn’t welcome in our class.

So I told the teacher. They got suspended, and me and my comrades (the classmates who helped me) celebrated with some starbucks. 

A day after that, they started murmuring stuff that I knew were about me, (duh), and some of them ignored me and even told one of my friends to side with them and tell them everything about me.

If you were in my position that’d be very hurtful, because you were the one who did the right thing but people still blame you. 

Since I have a problem with my emotions and a trouble with literally everything, instead of feeling sad and hurt, I just felt anger.

Imagine years of sadness, embarrassment, and hurt all converted to anger.

In simpler words I suddenly had a thought:
“What if they were dead?”

At first it was just a thought that I can dismiss.

But then every time I see their faces, I remember everything they’ve said about me.

So it turned from thoughts to scenarios in my head.
Scenarios in my head wherein they were yelling for help, bloody and close to death but I just stand there laughing.

Ok so yes I need help. Im not a psycho, I just really hate them. Everyone has these thoughts I think."
"Dear Diary

Well, music did it to me again.  I'm doing my work, having my playlist playing, and a song came up that made me flash back again.  

This song is about abortion.  While I haven't had to deal with an abortion myself, I have lost a child.  

All these years later and I still wonder what could have been.  Would she have been a dancer?  Maybe she'd have played sports.  Maybe she'd'a been a brain like her parents.  Not the lazy smart, but the I'm-gonna-go-places smart.  

Diary, I know you're wondering why I don't just delete those kinds of songs.  Lord knows I have enough of them.  

It hurts  like a knife ripping through me to be reminded of those times.  But I owe it to my daughter to remember her, even if she didn't make it to the world before leaving it.  I don't know when our spirits or essense becomes the people we are on this turn of the wheel.. I don't know if that vessel was inhabited or just waiting to be filled.  But it helps dealing with the loss believing that there was an essense there long enough to feel the love we had for her before moving on.

SotD: *Brick*, which inspired this entry."
"Dear Diary

It seems like every day is a repeat of the last day.  I get up, go to work, come home, go to bed.  Oh, it's not a rut, and I know there's variety in each day... but it all seems so shallow and pointless.  My soul screams for something more worthy than just repeating each day.  

Now you've been there and done that Diary.  You know what the cause of that is, just like I do.  I don't have a problem with the the reality of my situation, but I do have a problem when the theory of it overrides what the reality is and I get lost in the theory.  

SotD: *It's Been A While* - A song that has always resonated with me, but lately more than usual."
"Earlier this year, my colleagues were teasing me that my boyfriend might propose to me during our out of the country trip that time. I knew it's not gonna happen 'cause we're not financially capable yet of having the church wedding we wanted. Still, I wished he did.

I told them, ""not now, maybe by the end of the year?"". Besides, my boyfriend and I thought years before that we'll get married by 2019. Unfortunately, we still haven't saved up enough money because of our travels (which we don't regret having anyway), and also because we decided to use our savings as a downpayment for a future home we bought recently.

The year is coming to an end, and both our anniversary and my birthday has passed. I can't think of any more special occasions in the near future when  he'll probably propose. I wish that at the very least, he also thinks about getting married soon as much as I do. He knows I don't want to be the one to propose.

Sometimes I wish I'll just get knocked up so we really have to get married immediately then everything else falls into place. Or that I'll win the lottery so we won't have to worry financially. The former seems more plausible lol."
"It's been a while since I wrote an entry. Time seems to be getting faster and faster with each passing day. I'm knee-deep into my job, and I couldn't ask for better coworkers. I sometimes feel like time is going too fast. Today was my day off, and while I enjoyed it for what it was worth, it felt like it passed by too damn quickly. Well, there's nothing I can do about that. I just gotta keep trucking on.

There isn't much for me to say in terms of the science and research we are conducting in this lab. And, unfortunately, I cannot disclose too much info here. It's not like we're developing anything super secret, but I'd rather not risk disclosing any info pertaining to the research without the Professor's permission. Both him and the Doctor have my fullest trust now, which is something I have been longing to earn from the beginning. I can't look back now; I need to keep going.

In other news, my private, armchair investigation into those creeps has piqued my interests again. I'll certainly keep two eyes and ears out for anything even remotely suspicious, but maybe I should be more assertive in my methods. There's one of them who may know something, but there's really not much I can do on my part. We'll see how this goes.

It's only a week before Thanksgiving, and with it, 2020 is right around the corner. Shit, not even right around corner, more like inches away from my face.

I've a good feeling this week is going to be wonderful. It would be unscientific of me to say I believe in premonitions, but you know what, it's my entry so nobody's going to judge me too harshly.

Goodnight."

"I almost made a fatal mistake on Friday. Basically, it was the simplest mistake anyone could make. I switched the measurement of dosages for our specimens from milligram to gram. What a stupid thing to do. A simple unit conversion issue, and only with the base unit! Thankfully, my partner was there to correct me at the last second. This entire week has been very rough on me, so my head wasn't all there. I didn't actually give any of the specimens the substance, so I can say with confidence, crisis averted.

I was so salty in my last entry. I've just been stressed out, that's all. I'm taking the Monday tomorrow off because I need to go on my Saturday shift. It'll be a nice break for me and give me more time to clear my mind. 

My head's been kind of swirling with ruminating thoughts, which isn't good. Most of them are for looking ahead at what my future goals are, but some thoughts are just caked with negativity. I don't know. I feel like I overthink. 

I had to deal with an EDP on the station platform on Friday. EDP stands for ""emotionally disturbed person"", which is a polite way of saying someone who's off their meds or needs to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital. I know I'm being crude with my definition, but I don't feel like getting into the nuances. The man was clearly having an episode and began going from platform to platform, mad-dogging people right up to their faces and making threats of violence, among sputtering nonsensical things. He went up to me and threatened to ""punch me out"". I ignored him and he finally walked off towards his train. I feel bad for folks like that, but there isn't anything you can do when they're in that state of mind. Engaging with someone like that is a bad idea. Calling for an ambulance to get them to the hospital is probably a waste of time, too, because they'll most likely refuse to go. Sometimes calling the police may be the best option, but the cops are not mental healthcare workers and will probably not respond to something like that unless the patient poses an immediate danger to themselves and others. There was an incident about two years ago of an EDP being woken up from his sleep by park rangers for a welfare check. When he woke up, he immediately pulled out a knife and stabbed one of the rangers in the chest, though the ranger was okay. 

Ugh, people can be too much to handle. I'm already stressed out working in the lab, so I can only imagine what first responders have to deal with on a daily basis. I've gotten a little bit of a taste but never as a full-time job. Getting shot or stabbed by someone you're trying to help doesn't sound like a career for me. Or worse. I did do a ride-along with a police officer back in high school during senior year and, well, it definitely wasn't like what I had hoped it to be. Boring, a lot of paperwork, and you get to deal with the biggest assholes your community can throw at you. Every. Day. 

I was thinking of working for the state police as a forensic scientist after this job...maybe. I don't know yet. Then again, going to the pharma industry looks much more appealing in its money and business connections. 

I'm overthinking again. I'm ending this entry. Goodnight."
" I should probably write about my last suicide attempt since i got time and it might help me process this shit but i dont feel like getting better. I'm tired of this cycle. I get low, try so hard to come back up then i come crashing low hard when i see how these people can be. All these bitches give a fuck about is talking shit about others and laughing at them when their back is turned. People say sorry but don't fucking mean it. I can't stand people. I feel it in my chest. I need to calm the fuck down. it sucks cause i dont want to be a mean cunt but im not going to smile at the same bitches who talk shit and laugh at me behind my back. why would i do that? I called my case worker yesterday. no answer. fuck her dude she still hasnt given me an appointment with a therapist and continues to meet me at starbucks when she knows that shit bothers me. This one dude at work really thinks he's hot shit. he is fucking irritating. please god don't let nobody fuck with me cause i cant lose this job. I don't know if this writing shit is helping it only pisses me off when i go back and read through this shit. im not documenting my mental illness im documenting my fucking dissent into insanity. am i already insane? im not sure. if i am then im beginning to think ""this is fine"" I think pretending that these people arn't bullshit is closer to insanity actually now that i think about it. I texted angel last night asking for my screws back. he gonna text me when hes in \[my city\] apparently but i know im not getting my shit back. I think im fucking psychic i know exactly whats going on around me. i love it when people have no idea that i know what the fuck is up. I just sit here and pay close attention to the shit that spews out of their stupid fucking mouths. I feel like this type of mindset is what turns people into murderers or criminals. I need to be careful. I'm going in way too deep and i like it. Who knows where im headed but with my current mindset it can't be anywhere good."
"I read a tweet or something the other day about how someone's imposter syndrome was so bad that they felt bad even calling it imposter syndrome because they felt like even saying that was too much validation. That SHOOK me to my core, as I have that same exact thought all the time. I feel like I'm stuck in this weird paradox of success and failure, where when I view myself as an outsider, almost from an out of body experience, I'm like shit, dude, you're doing good! And then, I get thinking about my actual day to day life, and I'm such a fraud.... like my resume is pure threaded bullshit tying the loose ends of my experience together with literal lies. And on one hand, that's a talent lmao. I brag about it sometimes, how I can spin anything into something appealing to jobs and employers, but when it comes down to it, I feel terrified. 

From the outside, I got a Master's degree with a 4.0, international experience across the globe, I'm financially in a good position, and emotionally doing the best that I seriously have EVER been. And that totally sounds like I'm just jerking myself off, but then realistically, I invalidate all of it sooo fucking much. I think that my degree was easy, my university was a joke, my international experience was more like a vacation than actual work experience, I'm not currently in a job in my field, I'm not making anywhere close to good money, I'm just in a good financial standing because of how much I was/am coddled by my family, and emotionally I'm still pretty rough. 

And then, a little while ago, I was listening to the \[joe rogan podcast with Dr. Phil\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65epASHLblo&list=WL&index=15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65epASHLblo&list=WL&index=15)) (lmao) and it surprisingly was REALLY beneficial to me! I definitely write off Dr. Phil as more of a reality show character, as it's kind of hard to take him seriously professionally, but he dropped straight fucking wisdom. Dr. Phil began explaining how we aren't being fair to ourselves when we compare our successes to others. Not everyone is equal in terms of skills. This is a fact of life. Of course, every human is equal in terms of rights and life value, but every single person has a different set of skills that they have distinct levels of. 

Dr. Phil explains that although his home life was awful, and he didn’t get attention there, he was good at football and got positive attention and reinforcement that way. It didn’t matter what was happening at home. That became his currency. When he compared himself to the kid across the street with a good home life, he knew that although that kid had a better home life, he could play football better than him, and that became his currency and it leveled the playing field in his eyes. 

In my case, I need to consider my personal currencies, and FURTHER, my particular set of currencies, that in itself, is distinct to me. Dr. Phil's example was way too simplified for me, and I think that it's important to think about my entire set of currencies to make the biggest difference. I'm great with my finances, I'm educated, I've seen many amazing things  around the world, I'm blessed with a strong family to fall back on, I found my passion early-on in my life, I've overcome a learning disability that prevented my growth.... Some of these are definitely worth more than others, but I quickly just wrote down this list off the top of my head. I think I'll keep a notebook page dedicated to my currencies now, so I can jot some down when I think of them. 

The podcast went on to them both agreeing that they will never get recruited by the NBA, but they are good at other things, and by following what they are good at, they have found success. They don’t get down about their lack of this ability, and even more so, they are able to ACCEPT it. Joe says, “Well once you do something and you’re good at it, you can accept not being good at other things, it’s much easier.” 

I personally have a lot of fucking work to do before I can get on that level, but I really found that to be a potentially life-changing idea."
"This is a quick entry. I'm being overburdened with too many things at once. I don't mind, actually, as this is excellent experience, and if I do well enough, I'm certain I'll make a lasting impression on my team and others within the department. 

I gotta work this Saturday, but the upside is that I can skip Monday--and I get paid extra. 

Someone told me I should just drive into the city on Saturday instead of taking public transit. No thank you. I hate driving in general, and driving into and around the city is even more of a pain in the ass. I'll take the train and bus as much as possible, unless it's an emergency.

We got a new guy joining us next week, so that means more training.

This lab needs better management and communication, and I'll make certain to improve on that.

It's raining and is stormy outside. Perfect for October.

Goodnight."
"I got a text message from a certain cousin of mine. Yeah, the bad one. The family cautionary tale--the one that nobody wants to be affiliated with and everybody wishes he would just go away forever. He still doesn't have a job, and before you lambaste me for being a jerk and not taking into consideration on anything that's going on in his personal life, he literally has zero excuses. He's not disabled; he's got all of his limbs and digits intact; he's living a cushy lifestyle from his wife bringing in all the money while he sits on his ass collecting weight and dust; and, to top it off, he's an abusive manchild. I don't know what to say anymore about him. I really don't.

It's funny because at one point in my life, I revered the guy. I respected him with a lot of energy, thinking he was some kind of bigshot with a ton of cash. Seriously, when I was a kid, he would come in every month to my house with different cars. He would show up with different models, makes, colors, customizations, you name it. It wasn't until I grew up and became an adult that I finally learned he was leasing the cars under his father's name. In other words, his dad bought (temporarily) every car for him.

Anyway, I'm not gonna spend too much on this entry about that guy. He's a train wreck, pure and simple. And, also, if I find out he's put his hands on his wife, I will personally fly over to his place and kick his ass. I think he's too much of a coward to put his hands on anyone, despite his violent tendencies and outbursts. He'd get one lazy punch in and would have his ass immediately handed to him from someone--anyone--who could sneeze towards him and watch him fall into pieces. He's a bully.

It's been, what, 12 years now since he hasn't landed a job? I just don't understand how anyone could go on about that. It's crazy to think I used to look up to the guy and respect him. He's a bum, that's all. He doesn't deserve any respect because he can't show it to anyone else, not even himself.

I remember watching and hearing about this YouTuber who didn't leave his house for almost 7 years. At first, I thought he meant his hometown, but no, he literally meant not physically leaving his house for 7 years. I cannot even imagine that. I would go insane not being able to leave my place for a few days, let alone 7 goddamned years. That guy, however, did have an excuse. My cousin does not. 

I don't even know why I bother with him. I tried to help him. I and the rest of the family tried to help him. We even took him to one of the best psychiatric hospitals in the world, and even the doctors and therapists there couldn't help him. You know why? Because he stopped going. He said he was ""fine"" and that he didn't need those ""assholes to help me"". 

I'm pretty tired, so I'll end the entry here. Spooktober still going strong!"
"I love October! It's practically my favorite month of the year. With each day, I'm going to try to treat it as much with the Halloween spirit as possible. 

Today was a pretty miserable day. It rained for the first day of the month, and it honestly felt like a heavy atmosphere during my commute. I know I'm preaching to the choir when I say that nobody likes commuting, but it felt extra heavy today. It's most likely the damn weather this morning and how gloomy and gray it was outside. To quote Gimli the Dwarf: ""You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.""

Besides the gloom and doom, everything went all right today. I did more training for the experiments I'll be running, but I didn't actually get to handle the specimens because I don't have clearance yet from the uppers. So, basically, I can look but I can't touch, unless it's something incredibly simple. The Professor--well, he's not a professor but I'll refer to him as that to make these entries easier--did ask me to do him a favor that revolved around a technique I used in my old lab when I was in graduate school. It utilizes an automated type of analysis called ELISA, and I won't get into the technical mumbo-jumbo, but it's a powerful tool to use for analysis to find the concentrations of things. That's the best way I can put it for a layperson, no disrespect intended. I've already a ton on my platter right now so unfortunately, the Professor's stuff is going to have to wait, and he understands.

I swear, time seems to be getting faster as I age. And now that I've this new job, it feels like I'm in a time warp. All I have to do is blink and voila! The day is over. I don't like it. As a matter of fact, it scares me. Time itself doesn't slow down or speed up for anyone, but rather my perception of it makes it that way. Make it stop. This is uncomfortable.

Ugh, I'd never thought I'd say this, but I'm actually afraid of my own mortality. I'm going to regret putting in this entry, but the thought of getting old and dying one day from this daily grind is what terrifies me the most as much as being alone.

I need to distract myself from these things. They say a working man is a happy man, but then what? What happens after? For now, I'll end it on this note and say goodnight and Happy Spooktober!"
"This ends the first week of my job! I love the place I work at, although time will tell if I'll really enjoy it. Yeah, burnout is a real thing in any workplace, even in places that you may enjoy.

I've a lot of clutter in my head still, but I'll adapt to this new lifestyle. I'm trying to get my head straight and think about what's going to lie ahead.

I actually feel happy now, but I'm really tired, so I'll end the entry on this note."
"So I caught feelings with this girl even after holding myself for really long. Thank God, it was for a short period before I realized my mistake and the gain she was/is playing. Right now I don't to do anything with this girl. I am done. I have done my part. Went a little overboard convincing myself that I am doing good for her and that is what I want right. No, you were also looking for opportunities. You could have stopped and taken a step back whenever you wanted but you didn't. The game was always on. And you knew it, but since you are so lonely I will forgive you. It is ok. We cling to every little hope we have when we are low. It is fine. Don't be ashamed, don't feel foolish. You did what was natural. You don't have to worry about what others think. In your mind it is over and that is all that matters.

&#x200B;

Now, where do we go from here. I want money. This is something that has always made me feel weak. I don't feel free without money. I want money and to be able to spend that. I want a good partner. She could have been a good partner. Nothing wrong with her. Compatibility might have been an issue because she was not kind and still expected kindness from others. Not my fucking problem. I will find someone who is kinder and real. And I want a job. A fulfilling job. A job that I don't feel obligated to do but can approach with passion. 

Good money

Good job

Good relationship

&#x200B;

Now, these are the objectives. What are the challenges and intermediate goals.

**For jobs and money**: Build a good profile. Good website. Good videos. List of publications. Good codes.

**Good relationship**: You have to go out and meet more people. Intermediate goal. Go out more."
"I feel ...rejected..again. I feel lonely and lost. I have family and some friends but nothing seem to fill the void in my heart. I feel like a loser. Because I developed feelings for her. And I don't think it is mutual. I am not even gonna ask. I know you are/were just playing this games and never had any intention. Even I was sure about that, yeah, but now I feel rejected. I always feel like that. I am not happy. Nothing is working out for me these days. I feel like an absolute loser. I feel like I am spreading negativity talking and analyzing my issues with others. Duy was right, we should keep our negative feeling with ourselves, or at least share with very few chosen people in our lives. And I was talking about it to others as if I have won an Olympic gold medal.  Yeah you can surely change that.

Now, this is not the first time you are feeling like this. The sorrow is not going away soon. I know that. It will torment you for some time. But what you can do is to not let it stay any longer than necessary. You still have things you like to do, things you want to improve about yourself. Don't you want to be stronger, then do more exercises and eat more healthy stuffs. You want to improve your delivery of speech.  You have to clean your codes. You have write a journal. Improve vocabulary.

Dude. So many things to do, and here you are stuck with your aching heart for someone who doesn't a flying fuck about you and will not hesitate to hurt you knowingly. Just hang on and keep working on your daily life to make yourself better. The smile will come back, you will be happier. But only after working on yourself in this difficult time."
"I heard back from my uncle that he's been going around the country to do real estate work. This guy's something. He went from being a pharmacist, then went onto become a gas station and repair shop owner, and now he's getting into real estate. Well, good for him! He still has his education and skills he can always fall back on in case this real estate business flops.

His friends told me he's making ""millions"" now. Yeah, right. My uncle's a smart guy, but I seriously doubt he's become a millionaire within the span of a few months. He told me he made a pretty good living as a pharmacist, but the nature of the job started chipping away at his sanity. He would almost always get patients who would scream at and, on some occasions, threaten to hurt or kill him if they didn't get their meds immediately. The last straw for him was a psychiatric patient who chucked an empty pill bottle at his face and ""demanded"" a refill. Still, he said, it was damn good money. Of course, I don't expect anything less from someone who went to a good school and busted his ass off. And, if he wants to go back to that life, he always has his education.

I guess that's something many people invest in after a while, huh? Real estate. I don't know anything about the practices of the trade, but I know how lucrative of a profession it can be. Seriously, I know nothing about it save for what I've seen on TV and heard from other people. There was actually this one YouTuber I used to watch back in the day who, from what I heard, recently got into real estate and is now making millions on top of their already successful business. It sounds wonderful, but I can imagine the stress of selling and buying homes is too much. Anything with sales never interested me, but anyone who can make an honest living from that has my blessings.

I got my orientation coming up soon. I have been trying to make business connections on the side, but for now, I should focus on the job at hand. I'll try to multitask as much as possible, but the job is priority one, absolutely. 

Well, we'll see how this goes. Maybe one day I'll run into some big shot who'll introduce me into their trade or company and put me on a track to success. 

I shouldn't hold my breath."
"Dreams are what keeps a person afloat as they trudge through the days.  
Dreams encompass passion, direction - and most importantly - hope.  
Dreams separate humans from machines.

Never let go of your dreams."
"I feel inadequate, lost and lonely. Why inadequate: Because I don't have a near job prospect, no savings, no backup or support. Why lost: I feel that I have tried everything and still I am at the same place. I don't know how I can change that and if my efforts are going in the right direction. Why lonely: Because I am just lonely. No romantic interest, no close friends. Just family that I am not a big fan of. Because I don't respect them. Because I feel weaker with them. Because they don't give me strength. I feel embarrassed to have them as my family. 

Is it the reason that you feel all of that? Your family. Your poor, not so smart, not so respected family. These factors definitely makes me weaker in a social sense, being associated to my family. So what do you do? Leave them with their mediocrity and follow  a path that serves just you. Say you are very successful, then will you be happy leaving them behind? Or will you be even lonelier. Your family is weak, but sometimes when you are weak they have supported you. This has been true for my entire life. How can you think about them like that? Will you leave your friends who are not at the best stage of their life, because you don't get better social approval being associated with them? No, you will never do that. Then why think about your family like that. 

I am grateful for having my family and I accept them with all their weaknesses. If they are weak I will support them. If they are not smart, I will take care of their problems. If they are poor, I will do my best to survive with them. You have responsibilities towards them. You don't get to have their unquestioned support for all your life without fulfilling your duties towards them. Yes there are people who do that to their friends and family, but I cannot. It does make me weak in conventional sense being associated with them, but this is something you have to live with. Otherwise, you will be totally lost. You don't respect others who do that, and you will not respect yourself for doing something like that. That I can tell you now. And your inadequacy is relative. You are comparing yourself with people who are in a better place then you. But such is life. You are good where ever you are. And if you are persistent you will be better as a person first and if you are lucky, you will have more resources. 

You are focusing too much on what you don't have. You are not appreciating what you have. You have made some great friends, people respect you. You don't have any major medical problem. You are healthy. You are outgoing. You can control your emotions. You keep yourself motivated after countless failures. I will say you are an absolute winner. With all your problems, you can still be kind and connected with the world and the people in it. You are good. Don't worry about your current situation. Your estimation about yourself is wrong and their are insecurities that are giving you this perception about yourself. Just tell yourself, you are fine. I have hope that I will be happier tomorrow than I am today."
"I don't have a favorite color.

I can't decide - I never could, and I don't think I ever will. How do others decide on one? Is it red because of the dark, burgundy sweater their grandmother knitted for them when they were little? Or is it blue because they simply look up and see the sky every morning? Is it the color that evokes an emotion, or the associations with the color that do so?  
For me, I like soft colors. But that's as far as the distinction goes - I just can't pick one and put the others beneath it. Some days I like to wear red, or blue, or neutral colors like black and grey. But there's no favorite, a color that I identify with; a color that's part of my 'brand' so to speak.

I'm fascinated when people declare a color as their favorite so confidently and without hesitation, and it fascinates me more when they're unable to answer ""why?"" - they shrug and claim it just is.

I envy that."
"I had a written a long entry about how I feel, but it got deleted by bots, and now I feel stupid for writing anything. I really wish I could die, but I wouldn't want my parents to experience their only child's death. Instead I wish to be happy and for someone to genuinely share my happiness. I would die just to be able to connect with another person."
"I feel that I lost someone. I feel I lost everyone. I have to go back to my lonely self. It was always meant to be like that. There is no hope. Why? Why am I so weak emotionally? I know how it started today. She might get a job somewhere else, which was the case even before this happened. Or maybe because I feel she will never need me. It was bound to happen sooner or later. Why does it bother you? How does it change your situation? You are the same. A little weak because there is no one to call your own. But you make the most awesome friends. You have always revealed your true self and always have been honest. Yes it is painful, horrifying, scary, but that is the challenge, isn't it. To keep moving forward. Even when you are stuck in mud of hopeless loneliness. You move forward. A little bit everyday. Some laughs, some smile, some kindness here and there. A little work, a little creation, a little fun here and there."
"So I will try to be mindful of all the negative thoughts in my head and frame them in a positive way. I will keep editing this diary today and see how many negative thoughts go through my head and how can I frame it to something positive. Also noFap and noPot. Why noFap? Because it is something that I want to try to see what happens if I don't do it for few days. Consider it a practice of discipline. Remember what your bro told you yesterday. It is just a couple of hours in the evening that you have to suppress your craving. After then it goes away.

1. Even though my initial perception of the request to colleague to use his office for few hours felt a bit weird, I managed to go through with the request for help and succeeded.
2. Ooh how they fooled me and I could have been smarter. Or, I got the chance to learn a lot of things and now have more accomplishments than before. I have learnt how to manage expectation, how to be straight-forward and not being too nice or not too harsh, but professional. I also managed to change many bad habits."
"We focused on manual labor today and yesterday instead of service calls, we had to dig a 250 ft trench, run 2 inch PVC, then we had to dig for the floor boxes, the island electrical, and their respective PVC. Being in the Southwest in a landlocked state in the middle of the summer doesn't help either, the van thermometer read 115° today and it was barely 10 am. Yesterday I had so many cramps all over my body by the end of the day I really thought I was going to pass out from the pain, and today I had cramps so bad on my chest I lost my breath a passed out for half an hour. Thank God for ice cold water and shade right?

But all of that just reminds me how easy these days used to be, when the only thing that made all of this physical pain bearable was going home at the end of the day and seeing her. All of this, the heat exhaustion, the cramps, the pain, running out of breath, every little thing that could go wrong was nothing compared to the happiness that I felt everytime I saw her. And now I don't even have that luxury.

Maybe I should go on with my plan? 

It's nothing negative, well not at first. It would be hard, really hard at first. I wouldn't have anyone I know near me, but it would also make me more independent from everyone I know. I wouldn't have a backup plan either, I'd probably just go back if it fails. 

The hardest part about it? I wouldn't be close to her at all, if she needed me I wouldn't be able to rush over and be there a.s.a.p. But isn't that what she wanted? I'll never know, she probably wouldn't tell me anyways. There'll always be a spark of Hope in me though. Maybe one day we'll see each other again? Someday out of the blue? We'll have grown stronger and we'll compliment each other? It's all a possibility, but I won't rely on that. It's stupid to live in ""what if?.""

All I can do now I move forward, carry on with what I'm doing, and if someone, maybe even her again, wants to join me then they'll be welcome."
"It is a little awkward. Feeling isolated again. How do you handle it? Stay the same as you were with the crowd. Even worse can happen. The mob reacting against you. Right now it is just uncomfortable. How do you handle it? You have self-worth? I guess. I try to be nice and kind and helpful. I do my duties. I try to be honest. I am a little weird socially. How do you handle it? By not engaging or by engaging and failing and learning. Yes I am scared which is alright, fear is part of the game. Scared but still ready to face everything and staying true to my character and not displaying any dark behavior. 

But the world not so kind. How does it affect you? It makes me scared of my leap of faith. Well then you continue. This is life. You learn by failing. It is bit tough but you keep on trying."
"I'm new to this sub but was suggested to post this story here.

This is long. Tldr at bottom.


Quick background; my mom, brother and I have severe food allergies. My mom is more allergic than my brother is, and my little brother is more allergic than I am.

We're allergic to everything edible, everything outside, and I'm allergic to all animals but no molds. My little brother is allergic to all molds, as well as my mom, so they can't take penicillin.

The doctor has no idea why we're allergic like we are and the insurance won't cover extensive testing. So we're weird and don't know why.

The thing with my allergy is; I can't have food that's raw. If it's cooked to a certain point I can eat it. But I have levels of allergic reactions. Bananas and avocados are really bad, melons come next.

At the bottom of the spectrum are berries, kiwis, and starfruit. I don't react with Dragon fruit at all.

I honestly thought it would be the avocado I eat in sushi that would get me. I have to carry an Epipen with me but I'm also intolerant to stimulants so that would do more harm than good.

I didn't have food in the house but three bags of chips and a box of saltines and no way to get food until today so for the past few days I've been eating that. My tongue swelled and blistered from too much salt. That's an important detail.

I had a ride to get a food box today and in it was a tiny container of cut strawberries and kiwis. I had some other good stuff so I made myself a meal and ate the whole little box of fruit which equalled out to two cups of fruit.

As I was eating the strawberries my tongue started to burn, but I figured it was from the acid so I kept eating. Normally it's a weird itch in my ear when I eat berries and that hadn't started so I thought I was in the clear.

After I finish the fruit my tongue started to feel funny, bigger, and my lip started to swell. Just the bottom lip. Again I've never had a bad reaction to anything I've eaten before, just an itchy throat and hives at the worst.

It was when it started to become hard to breathe that I realized what was going on, and by then my throat started to constrict and my lip got really big.

My mom saw what was happening, we were eating in her room and watching TV, and gave me a benadryl.

She offered the only Epipen we had but it was expired, insurance issues, and I didn't want to go to the hospital here. I would rather die at home than at Kings Slaughter hospital.

I gave it time and was sure I would be taking an ambulance ride if it didn't stop. Right when mom picked up the phone to call 911 after I decided I would have to go, it started to calm down.

I went to lay down and let the benadryl work, but I wasn't all the way okay. I didn't know that, this hasn't ever happened before, even though the doctor warned that anything I eat could turn on me, it hasn't happened before so I didn't think anything of it.

As I'm in bed I was wearing my sleep apnea mask and that honestly might have saved me. It was getting hard to breathe but the benadryl had sedated me enough I couldn't move or call out for help, stupid sleep paralysis, so I just lay there and slowly felt like I was dying.

When my brother woke me up the symptoms had passed. I won't be eating any more raw fruit. I will nuke them in the microwave first from now on.

Tldr; I ate something I didn't have a reaction to normally and almost died.

Take allergies seriously, even if they're not strong, because any moment you can have a bad reaction."
"I caught my father smoking again. Idiot. The man's got type-2 diabetes, is in his 60's, is obese and is slowly becoming a walking chemistry set with all the meds that he's taking to keep him alive. He just doesn't care, and no, the excuse of ""I don't fully inhale the smoke so I'll be fine"", bit doesn't work. I love him, but his health is being put in jeopardy every day. I wish he would just retire, but he needs to support my brother and sister, and mom. I've been trying to support him as well, but he insists that I use my money for myself. He gets so defensive when I talk about money and try to help him. He's got too much pride in him. Ugh, stay safe, dad.

In other news, uncle got his car keyed up. He's suspecting his unruly neighbor did it, the one he had a row with a few days ago. He's got no proof, though, and that neighborhood is filled with other ""characters"" in general, so it's not like that guy is the only suspect. I still don't know why he chose to live there. I know it's because it's cheaper, but why surround yourself with a bunch of trashy people? Well I'm sure most of his neighbors are tolerable, but then you have guys like that who're just looking for trouble. Oh well, he knows how to call the police and handle himself, surely.

I went to my short interview with the professor yesterday. It was so damn hot, and it being a Monday put everyone on edge. Seriously, asking a simple question of, ""Where is the Professor's office?"", got me so many death stares. It's a big city so I expect that kind of attitude from most people there by now. Anyway, I spoke with the good doctor and he asked me for two letters of reference. No big deal. I've been trying to get them, but I'm pretty sure my references have been on vacation. They'll come around eventually...I hope. One of them in particular was a pain in the ass to work with in the past. He's a brilliant scientist, but talking and working with him was like nails on a chalkboard. And, yeah, he had a temper. I've been somewhat pestering him to get a reference letter, so I hope he doesn't outright block my emails. Whatever. I'll still have others who can speak on my behalf.

That section of the city was unknown territory for me. I did go there when I was a kid, but I don't remember the details. Now, as an adult, it looks sketchy. Overall, it's a safe place but you wouldn't catch me walking around certain parts at night. I'll just end it on that note.

I'm not banking on getting a job from this guy. He told me immediately after the interview that he needed to interview other candidates, some of them being postdocs. Great. Well, the moment he told me that, all hopes of getting a position in his lab was dashed to pieces. I cannot possibly compete with someone who's got a PhD and postdoc experience, at all. I'm gonna keep expanding to other positions, but, well, I'm starting to become more and more weary. 

If I have to hear another person tell me, ""Sell yourself harder"", I'm gonna slam my face into the pavement repeatedly until I can't recall who I am anymore."
"A few days ago, my uncle had a spat with one of his neighbors. According to him, he hired a bunch of contractors to cut his lawn's grass and they ended up dumping the grass on the far reaches of the lawn. Uncle was on vacation, so he didn't know about this until he came back. On the day he came back, an angry neighbor demanded him to clean up the rotting grass. My uncle, being the hothead that he is, told him to ""fuck off"" and that it wasn't his business to tell him what to do. 

Long story short, he's been butting heads with the guy ever since. Apparently this isn't the first time this guy's done something like this. According to other neighbors in the area, he's had the cops called on him many times for harassing and bullying other people. And, allegedly, he abuses his dog. Well I wasn't there to see what happened, so I can't really be the judge. My uncle has a good heart but he doesn't know how to defuse hostile situations. He has a one track mind when it comes to these things, so if someone is looking for an argument or a fight with him, he's happy to oblige.

I have to remind him that he has a child to take of. As a father, he needs to put away petty business with others and only focus on what matters in his life: his family. Easier said than done, I know, but having discipline is a key trait in life. Ah, well, he'll be fine. The guy's been living longer than I have, so I've confidence he'll be okay.

That's pretty much all I got for today's entry. I gotta go meet another person on Monday for a possible lab position. I'm not holding my breath, and I don't expect any miracles at this point.

Let's just hope for the best."
"Between fighting my anxiety and depression wombo combo, doing my best at a job where customers can be rude or cruel, and the never ending to do list of the chores in my house that I never seem to be on top of.

Today I boiled over. I screamed ans cried and then got so upset I puked. My only meal up in the sink, and then I had to unclog the damn thing. I'll have to check it out again later, make sure my bathroom doesn't stink.

I tend to just freeze. So on days where I'm off, I spend it endlessly scrolling instead of doing anything productive. 

A win fall would be awesome, but I've been taken advantage of too many times and, magical money coming your way and solving problems is not how anything works. 

I really feel powerless to do anything in a world that's being destroyed for profit. I'm not confident that anything will change. 

And I feel sad about everything."
"Hey, you have not achieved anything significant in life.

Hey, you are immature.

Hey, you are every girls second choice.

Interesting! Thanks for your opinion. It's good to know that you care so much that you have opinions and judgement about me. But I am a little busy right now, trying to live my life. Please excuse me. See you later. Bye!"
"I found out today that one of the girls that suddenly stopped talking to me had started dating another guy. Another one! : )  Dude! The pattern is so obvious. Now, it seems two of these girls want to come back in my life. I am not sure about that, but seems like a possibility. There had been previous occurrences of similar nature in the past. I have a problem. I look for emotional support everywhere. Or, I can say, I had a problem. Because I have stopped myself from doing so, at least in personal settings, for some time now. What really hurts is the feeling of being rejected?  How can I take them back without hurting my ego? And how will I ever trust them?

&#x200B;

You don't have to. I agree that it was because of your own shortcomings and clingy behavior that these people were driven away. But do you really want them in your life. They were desirable to you when you were at your lowest. Might want to find out once you are on top. Remember there are very few friends here, very few people that will help you without wanting anything from you. There are, but majority of them have their own issues and you are just another tool for them. You are a tool because you have made yourself available for them to use. I am no tool, I'm actually nuts : ) 

&#x200B;

I will not make any decision unless I am sure of my worth. When will know that I have achieved self-realization? I don't know yet, but then, it is called realization for a reason :) Right now, just stay disciplined and mindful. Your worse enemies are your reactiveness and  lack of discipline."
"It's been the second consecutive time she has brought this question about how I would treat them when they get older. I think this is mind game they (both my parents) play, where I am put in a situation of disadvantage, doesn't matter what I choose. If I say, I am gonna treat them like kings then I would be held accountable to that answer. At least my conscious will. If I say what I really feel, i.e. my own personal life is more important for me and there well-being while equally important, their comfort takes the second place, I am made to feel bad. I think it is a mind game. And I don't have to participate.

So, how do you deal with it, or people like that. First of all, be careful of your own emotions. You express things too fast and without much before-thought. You are just giving them more tools to control you. Second, don't entertain them. Ok...hmm...I will think, these are all good answers. Once you recognize these traps, then it is important to keep your cool and control over your thoughts, words and actions. I am not aware of all these traps right now, but I will try to be mindful of my strong emotion to things and hopefully will fair better in those situations in the future."
"December last year I decided I would study abroad for a semester. February this year I booked a tour for 26 days. I was doing all of this solo, on my own. On the 23rd of July I set off my adventure boarding my first plane at 6am. After almost 20 hours of flying, I reached my destination. The whole process was fine, I didn’t get lost anywhere, I got through customs and security with no problems, I made all my flights on time. I even had a nice guy on the plane with me. I was still very much excited. As my bus from the airport got closer to my hotel, I realised I wasn’t in such a great area. I decided to stay positive though and have a nap. 

About four hours later I was woken by my room mate, a complete stranger. We said hello and briefly spoke, I then said I was going to lay down a bit longer. She left the room again and I went back to sleep. When I woke up, I decided to get changed and get myself some food. I walked down the street, not too far where I found a food market. I felt uncomfortable walking by myself. It was absolutely boiling so I was wearing a crop top and skirt. I felt everyone was staring at me, and I wasn’t wrong. I stood out a fair bit, wasn’t many other girls with fair skin and blonde hair. When I got to the market, I had an old man blow me a kiss and wink at me. I thought ok yeah, I’ll just get take away and eat it back in my hotel. I got a juice then went to get myself a pizza. When my buzzer went off to collect my pizza, I found my room mate with another girl. 

We said hello and they invited me to sit with them for dinner. We spoke, they were normal, fine, nice. They then invited me out the next day, but I declined because of my strict budget. As I spoke to my room mate more, I realised we were very different. Our room mates were meant to be matched with us by the same age, occupation, interests etc. My room mate was seven years older than me, had not attended university, was working full time, and had no interest in doing any physical activities with me. I was disappointed, but she was nice enough so I just told myself it would be alright. The other girl was my age, had just graduated from university, and was interested in doing some walking and hiking activities with me. 

We all walked back to our hotel whilst the other girl went to her room, and my room mate and I went back to our ours. We talked some more, I was feeling odd so I went to the lobby to call my mum. When I called her I just started crying. I wasn’t sure what was wrong, but I just had this awful feeling. I didn’t miss home, or her, or anyone, nothing had gone badly, I was just overwhelmed with emotions. She told me I’d feel better in the morning and I was just jet lagged and it was normal to feel upset. I still felt like shit, but I went back to the room and showered. I planned to cry out everything else in there. The water was cold, it wouldn’t warm up. I just stood there shivering trying to wash my hair. I was too distracted to even cry. I got out, jumped in bed and tried to get warm again. 

That’s as much as I will write now, it is a long story. I will get back to this in a few hours or days."
"I'm back again and life is still good. I have been experiencing a bit of anxiety lately though. Not sure what it is stemming from really. I did some mushrooms last week a couple times and I do feel that may have added to how I am feel this week. I also have alot going on right now. I will be on CNN coming up next month sometime. I am working on a magazine. THis is probably contributing to how I feel more than anything. I definitely need to take some time to myself and re-calibrate the system. After this weekend my gf will be gone for a couple weeks so I can spend that time doing me time stuff. acupuncture, massages, meditation, etc. I also have not been practicing my regular meditation as usual and last week i switched up my diet and haven't been eating gluten for a week now. I guess more than anything there has been alot going on and alot of change and this as I know is what is adding to the weight I feel. I did go for a run yesterday so that helped, but I need to keep up my daily meditation routine. In fact, I am going to do a quick session right now. I am really excited about everything going on but it is a bit overwhelming and given the fact that I am getting used to a new diet, my energy levels are lower than usual. I know in the long run it will be very beneficial as overall I still feel much better this week than last (stomach pains have subsided and facial skin is clearing up) it will take some time to get used to. one love."
"I have felt that my self worth is dependent on external acceptance. I look for people to admire my work and I am satisfied as soon as this condition is met. And am sad if does not happen. Now, these people have their own things to take care of, they can be ridden with insincerity or jealousy. So, expecting to get a sincere feedback is a bit too much to ask. 

Now, I never got any unconditional love when I was younger, so I don't have that kind of mental security. I was put down for my looks and height by immediate and far family members. I don't blame them, they are just humans acting out their impulses. But I do not have or expect any self worth from them, because I don't believe that my value me for just being myself. I am worthy as long as I am successful. 

So, the only proper way to feel self worth for me is, to be good at things that I like doing. Like coding, exercising, helping others and being kind. I am also working on my speech, because I feel that this is something that I have always struggled with and it eclipses a lot of qualities I have. 

I have already started my day on a high note, by exercising in the morning and now writing this diary. I would try to be as productive as possible in my work today. And by the end of the day, I would like to work an hour on my CV and half an hour on my speech. And finally taking night shower and going to bed early."
"I finally managed to get broadband in the house. It took almost a week and it is still in processing. I cannot login to my account yet, but I guess the updation of new accounts takes a while. But I am online and I am on my machine for the first time since 8 July. That's a lot of time browsing the web on phone for a geek like me. I missed the big keyboard and the bigger screen. 

This week got a lot of things done, the new bed was built, the wall in the backyard and the wall in front of the house was built, there was a ledge that needed fixing and that was fixed, a part of the kitchen also needed to be built to prevent any water damage in future...all that got done. I am poorer by a good deal of cash, but it's all going towards the house, so can't really complain. The wife is ordering plants online and offline. We went to a nursery yesterday to look for some plants and she was happy that she got a good deal of plants for pretty cheap. The nursery guy will deliver the plants here today. 

For this week, we need to look for a school for the kiddo. We got him out of one of the best schools in the earlier city because the move here was coming one way or another and there was no point in starting a session and then exiting mid-way. He's been home for too long now and I think he might not want to go to a school as of now. But we'll see. 

On another front, I need to get a vehicle. Not a car cuz the budget is tight. But a used two-wheeler and I can't buy a new one because I don't plan to use it for long. Once the finances stabilize, will look for a car. What else? I need to buzz up some of my clients to get the work started again. Or I need to look for some new clients. That's how it goes in freelance life. You don't work, you don't get paid for long. 

&#x200B;

Don't go freelance, kids. It's a lot of struggle before you see any results and even when you do, nothing is certain in freelance life. It's not much, but it's honest work. 

&#x200B;

I am back at my desk that I used from 2008-2014. That's a lot of years. A lot of mileage. I am back and I can't believe it."
"I went back to the museum today to visit the contemporary wing, and others, too. They had an exhibit open to the public that depicted different kinds of clothing, mostly fashion-designed clothes, that both men and women wore. They also had them on display, specifically talking about gender and identity in regards to clothing, along with the history of it. It was extremely interesting, and I only wished the gallery was larger to look at more displays.

The entire gallery dealt with gender identity, mainly in the perspective of LGBTQAI+ folks. Basically, the entire premise of the displays was that you should be comfortable with what you wear. It showed all kinds of people trying on different kinds of fashion-designed clothing. Women wearing what's considered to be men's outfits and vice versa. It was cool to look at, and the colors in that part of the museum were bursting to the seams. I'm not a fashion person myself, and I'll never understand the world of fashion design, but I do wholly support people wearing whatever they want to wear.

I wish people would just get along and stop judging others for what they wear and who they are. It's a naive point of view, sadly, because it's never going to happen. People will always discriminate one another over anything, and clothing is a hallmark of that. The fact we have a gallery dedicated to challenging gender identity via fashion is obvious to that point, along with anti-discriminatory laws that need to be passed because some people cannot stand others' existence, apparently. With that being said, it was a beautiful gallery.

On the other side, there was this very disturbing gallery in the contemporary wing of the museum. The artist had these abstract paintings and drawings of cadavers, which are dead human bodies being examined for medical and educational purposes. ""Disturbing"" is the word I use, but there really was no word to describe how morbid and bizarre it was. Excuse the condescending tone, but I found it strange how an artist could be so entranced by corpses of people. Seriously, virtually all of the gallery of this artist was dedicated to drawing dead people (sometimes animals) in warped and twisted ways. The guy had an obsession in drawing these bodies with their entrails bursting out in horrific ways, all brightly painted and colored in an abstract fashion. It was, to say the least, eye-opening.

There was supposed to be another gallery open in another wing of the museum, but unfortunately, they haven't renovated it yet. Ah, well, maybe some day.

I gotta go pick up my folks tomorrow at the airport. Ugh, I hate driving in rush hour, but I'll probably just leave early to beat traffic.

Stay safe, everyone. Goodnight."
"I went to bed feeling ill last night. I had been fine most of the day, but felt I needed fresh air and went out to sit in my yard and read.

I don't know what happened, but I had barely read even a paragraph, when I felt an overwhelming sense of vertigo. I tried to shrug it off, but gave up after reading a few more minutes, I still felt dizzy and uneasy. I went back inside, laid down on the couch. It was still early in the evening, not even supper yet.

The whole of the evening was like that and at about 9:30 I went upstairs, read a bit, had a glass of wine and went to bed.

Out like a light. I have vague memories of my husband coming to bed and I'm not even certain of those.

I woke, unsurprisingly, at about 4:30 or so, did a few things downstairs, mostly looking at my phone and social media, then went back to be and slept till fifteen minutes ago. Which brings me to what woke me up.

My dream was one of those hypnagogues. I was with my husband in the living room (which didn't look at all like our living room really does) when I saw an email on the wall asking me if I was still there and wanted something. The something turned out to be 3D puzzles that moved about and I'm not even certain now how you solve them.

I got tired in the dream, and told my husband I was going to go up and go to rest for a bit, not to worry (because he was concerned about me being sick and it was early yet).  I went up but instead of going to my room I ended up in the attic. This was more like the attic to our old house, but it was empty, completely. I didn't want to be up there, I couldn't figure out how I got up there even, it was menacing, without any signs of something that should have been scary at all. While dark it wasn't pitch dark or even gloomy, just a big empty room with the lights out. Light came from the hall, and the door was open, and the steps clear, yet still I was afraid.

I tried to get up and go down the stairs, but I couldn't. After a bit of trying, really only a minute or two if that, I felt completely overwhelmed by exhaustion and decided to lie down on the floor, right there at the head of the stairs, despite my fear of the place.

As soon as I laid down I woke up.

Which was kind of like shades of Hill House I think. 

So, reality? I am going to have one weird day."
"Being left out from today's get together doesn't bother me at all. I would have refused anyway. Why don't I enjoy their company ? I promise it is not my fault. It is just, there is no common ground for us, and whatever there was should not be disturbed.

&#x200B;

I was feeling like a king today. Today during my afternoon nap, I started thinking about how I am filling myself with so much negativity. Why am I describing myself as a loner, hateful person? I have always tried to be useful to people. Yes, I have emotional issues, but I have always tried to be respectful and not laugh on anyone's misery. Never plotted against anyone. Well, almost never. I have said bad things about others in their absence, so that does count as plotting or at least defaming. I am pretty sure I am a good person.

&#x200B;

I can be better. In fact, when I was pondering over the question: who am I ? I thought, well, my mind is makes all sorts of wrong conclusions and has convinced me that I am a bad person, why can't I tell it that I am benevolent king and the whole world is my subject. I am the best king ever. I have everything under control. But you are worried about the past. You are worried about what you did in the past. You are scared. You are scared because your achievements are given and your failures will be registered. You have learnt only to fear failures and you don't know how to appreciate success.

&#x200B;

With all these fears, YOU ARE A KING BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALWAYS SOMETHING LEFT TO GIVE AND NEVER EXPECT ANYTHING IN RETURN."
"I have noticed that whenever I feel wronged or disrespected by someone, I sometimes get so angry that I cannot face them. And in some cases, I avoid them. So, basically my hates makes me weak. I feel some kind of shame for being angry. I am really bad at confronting others, and it takes really long before I start to feel anything. 

&#x200B;

I have to learn to face all hate and criticism without hiding in my shell and burning inside with anger. I would rather think like this: Dude! what you did was really stupid. It's not that any of us are going to disappear. So, Let's set some boundaries and stay peacefully. Not that I hate you, in fact, I don't have a choice. I would like keep my head high and mind clear. So, please stay in your limits and I will stay in mine."
"So, you are complaining about how never felt secure in terms of finance and all your life decision was to share the burden of you parents. And you feel that it has contributed to your lack of confidence. You also complain that you never had any emotional support, because you were always a trophy child and your only worth were your achievements. You crave those appreciations from random people for little meaningless things. 

&#x200B;

And now you feel lost because you don't feel that your work is appreciated by people. You are always looking for that appreciation of doing something marvelous. And why not. This is why artists do what they do. There is a need of appreciation. But you lose confidence very quickly. You quit at the slightest sign of trouble, unless it is something you really have to do. You are not very committed to your creations. You want appreciation for your half-hearted efforts."
"Been a while since my last confession lol. I am just going to go off top. I am truly grateful for my life right now. It has it's ups and downs but I am so lucky to be living this life. My life is perfect. I have a house, a job, an amazing gf, amazing parents, overall a healthy guy. I can't ask for much more. In the morning when I open my eyes it feel miraculous to just be taking in a conscious breath. Again, there are ups and downs, but that is the beauty of this life we live. Challenges arise and we figure out ways to do our best with them. Right now I am still trying to learn myself. Learn what every cell in my body is capable of doing and how I can improve their functionality. For far too long I was too consumed in making money and what other people would think of me to truly sit down and enjoy the life I have been given. As soon as I switched to living in the present and trying to learn and understand myself it was as though a switch went off and from the point moving forward life has been much easier. I also was making life so hard on myself. I was using drugs and alcohol which while you are on you are not at your peak performance. you are always a step behind. Now I feel like I am moving and a normal pace for my life and not dragging my feet. Walking in sand. That is all I got today. I will work to not wait so long between confessions. hope everyone has a beautiful day."
"Today marks 16 years since my family and I have moved to Israel! So, we are celebrating! Barbecue, french fries, salads, and family. I can't wait till everyone arrives. 

Basic bbq stuff. Hot dogs, hamburgers, kabobs, if my daughter-in-law brings chicken we will have that as well. Nice little summer shindig.

I get to be basically lazy, and let the hubby do most of the work, but I did make the salads and my daughter is making the fries.

Anyway, nothing much day, which is fine by me."
"in 8 days i will be 18. however it doesn’t help the emptiness in my soul. the longing for someone who lost me, and the loneliness that came with losing everyone close to me. i continue moving forward for someone else. i feel worthless and useless. i have no talents and the things i used to do seem trivial on why i did it. i used to draw. i can’t draw anything. i’d like to know that something will go right. i’d like to have someone with me again. he says he can’t keep having me be alone. he says i need to move on. but i can’t. not right now. i wish time could stop so i could process things. it’s almost been a year since it all happened. i wish i’d get another letter on my birthday, whether it be hatefilled or not. just some sort of acknowledgement. i miss having friends. i don’t care that you go jealous. i don’t care that you lied to everyone. i just want you back. you’re the only person i could ever love. everyone else i would’ve given up but, i care for you. and i don’t know why i keep living on. i have no purpose. i never did. i always leech off of others. it’s not like tomorrow will change. just another day."
"I had a bizarre dream two nights ago. It wasn't another nightmare, thankfully, but it was interesting as most dreams are. I was in an unfamiliar city--something made up by my head--and it was intermixed between ""futuristic"" and nature. In other words, there was lush vegetation mixed with techno-futuristic stuff. The best way I can describe it is this: imagine if an enormous sci-fi city existed within the Amazon jungle.

I remember walking with a lady, about in her 30's to 40's, wearing a long red dress. She was taking me to a train station to ride on one of those futuristic-looking bullet trains, like the ones you see in Japan but much more ""advanced""...I really don't know how to properly describe it. I distinctly recall the environment: again, greenery from nature interlaced with silver and steel that make up a sci-fi metropolitan scenery. And there was this blinding glare from the sun...and that's it. That's all I can remember. Maybe I should keep a dream diary, or treat parts of this online diary with entries like these. It would certainly break the depressing monotony of me ranting about job interviews most of the time.

With that being said, it's time for some mandatory complaining about job hunting! So, per usual, good news and bad news. Good news: more connections with people in the industry. Bad news: I got back from another employer and they said I was overqualified. Of course, they won't outright say ""overqualified"". Instead, they tactfully cloak with the words ""not matching our current business needs"". It's more unnecessary jargon, but whatever, I get it. I was actually hoping to get that job as a backup plan, but I guess it was dead from the beginning.

I still haven't heard back from the hospital. I applied back in mid-June and it's been almost a month now. The lady from HR told me there were *still* going through candidate interviews. This is ridiculously frustrating. If they don't want me, they should just say so before I continue to get my hopes up. I'm banking on a 40% chance of getting this job. Yeah, I know the odds are not in my favor, but if they wanted to hire me at this point, they would have done so. Or maybe I'm wrong. Maybe they just want to be kind to other candidates before they give me the offer, I don't know.

In the meantime, my head has been buzzing with other thoughts. I started thinking about a certain online video game community I mentioned a while ago and how I accused two (and possibly more) of its users being involved in some deplorable things, to say the least. I actually planned on going to the embassy today to talk to someone about it, but I had to run personal and family errands. I don't even know why I'm getting myself involved with this shit. I try not to stick my nose in other people's business, but this *business*, if you can even call it that, is disgusting. Plus, I've piss-poor evidence, as I've stated before. No one in that community is willing to help me, and the last time I asked for help from someone, they immediately got cold feet and stonewalled me. So much for that. I'm not trying to play ""Internet cop"", but I also don't feel well knowing those guys are--allegedly, of course--doing what they're doing.

I'm not doing well myself. I've been neglecting my exercises and have started to waste away. I've lost a significant amount of weight, which is not good in my case. I feel weak and tired. Ugh...all of this is killing me to death by inches. 

As childish and stupid as this sounds, I really tonight I can have that same dream again and revisit their world. Maybe I can stay awhile, just long enough to escape mine."
"I've been feeling lost for awhile now, maybe one of you can point the way for me.

6-19

I haven't had a writing utensil for weeks! [I moved for a summer internship]. I stole one from the office.

At this point I'm 104% sure I have Asperger's. My dad certainly has it, probably a good deal worse than I do!

While I was commuting to [my new city], I got a snapchat text from a member of my new dnd group that they don't want me to join anymore. They said I ""invited myself to dinner with them after one of them said I was uninvited"" and that I was ""rude and snapped at one of them"" and mentioned that they ""unanimously agreed"" I should leave.

I joined after I gave a failed show-and-tell style presentation for a creative project for an honors semi-course on table top games. I couldn't finish it because I gave myself to big a project (although I was genuinely really interested in it). The underlying technology I used for the project revealed itself as unworthy just as I completed the project, just before presenting. I gave the presentation improvised and got a few good laughs from the audience. After, I complimented others on their projects and what I liked about them. The girl that would later (much later, like 4 weeks later out of the blue) kick me from the group offered me her snapchat and let me into their gaming group. They mentioned they were going to dinner and I did what I interpreted/intended as asking to join them. I wanted to get to know my new group! They did what I interpreted as agreeing that I can tag along. [Context: this was the last week of the semi-course, so it was the only dinner I would accompany until I joined the game group late in the summer after my internship. The group has routine outings together]. I did my best to be polite and sparse contributing to conversation. I left early, before the group disbanded for the night. I felt positive, and happy that I and, as I understood, they had a nice evening.

The group member that would later kick me since texted me about once, relating to the game. She called me 'bud', which I briefly interpreted as condescending, but I shrugged it off. I hoped to come off as more of a new peer than someone to babysit.

Ironically, during that dinner we talked about one student's presentation about the benefits of DnD for developmentally disordered children.

I haven't always had exactly fun experiences with DnD. One DM had all the npc's be uninterested when talking to my character. He would tell me I just can't do the things I attempt, gave other people random loot items but never me until I asked about it (although in hindsight, I shouldn't have mentioned it during playtime) even though I was the only player to show up every week, and of course, eventually I would run out of ideas. I was a new player. After the session he'd tell me ""Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it eventually"" unprompted, apologetic for *my* shitty performance. Really condescending! And I used to believe him. Other people could move water at will by the time I still had basic equipment. When I did get an item, he'd reveal it to the effect of ""here's your fucking quick draw bow"" anticlimactically, and promptly explained an immense power someone else would've gotten if they picked it up, as if to say I was being a whiney bitch for not getting shit. And he'd put me on the spot for rare, important decisions, which sounds exciting, except that even though they were hugely open ended, I had to read his mind to unlock treasure, and then would tell the group what they missed out on because I couldn't get it right. For example, I was supposed to ask this devil creature magically bound to a book ""Do you want to be free?"" Whereas I asked it ""do you like it in there?"" To which it replied, ""it's fine.""

My coworker says he was the leader character in every DnD game he's played. He says ""You just gotta go for shit.""

In general, I get a lot of apathy from people, at school, in professional settings, and at bars. Particularly girls, platonic friends who start to actively avoid me after 2-3 friendly encounters with them. It feels weird and bitchy to say I don't get enough validation in my life. Another coworker sometimes says I'm a ""whiney little bitch,"" I think mainly in jest. Even my supervisor once made fun of my penis size. Tbh, that size is the least of my worries, I'll leave it at that. I think these comments come mainly from sexism rather than my personality, even though I am a straight male. Even women are sexist towards me! I swear I get it from looking so little and androgenous. I don't think I can ever change this treatment. I'm so little I'm offputting. I hate myself, I hate what I am, I hate being autistic, I hate everything about me. Just once I don't want to be the 'little brother' of the group.

I have no security that I even perceive things other people do that make me look so pathetic/boring/weak/lame/stupid/awkward/dorky.

At least a couple guys from the gay bar said I'm cute 😔. That's not my scene, people probably make the wrong assumption about me.

I like my roommates. I like my coworkers. I like my bosses. I love it here! But I hate me.



Thank you for reading. I've spun over this stuff for a long time and maybe one of you can help me move past this."
"I can't believe it is already 7 pm. Where did the day go?

I learned how to do Tunisian crochet. I have to keep practicing because I don't have it down so well.

My daughter gifted me with a lot of yarn, most of which is novelty yarn, mostly I guess stuff I need to add to regular crocheting.  

And my shawl is nearly done. I figured about ten - twenty more rows and I'm done. 

Thursday we have a barbecue at our house and Shabbat we are by my daughters."
"I think a lot and maybe too much and too often about how I'm going to entertain myself while I'm at work doing boring things (this applies to any situation when I have ""nothing"" to do). It gets overwhelming because I never seem to satisfy my boredom... I walk around the same places in the warehouse maybe 10 times within 4 hours, I tape up things in the meantime, no one is really all that interactive except one lady... I keep a journal with me but for some reason I feel that's not enough to keep my mind thinking of something not work related, like I need some sort of simulating activity while peregrinating. But... I've come to realize that many of the thoughts I conjure and harbor is just... pure noise. Whenever I go to work, life happening outside of me is always the same each and every day--unchanging. What's not the same, is my thoughts and how I choose to make it (my day at work) out of. So I wondered in a loop as I lay in my room... Well, if operation is the same, why not just take in the moment? Life at work can be just as still as my thoughts can. If I didn't come up with a solution to feel entertained, I'd feel miserable thinking work will never end and adding on unnecessary stress. I shouldn't require myself every day to do something different... being in the moment, recognizing my presence, and being at peace most importantly is all I should ask for. What's wrong with that? Quite frankly, doing nothing or being mindfully still in the moment is the best thing to do to feel happy/content with life. I always keep my pocket size journal on me if any cascading thoughts come about, but I think the main focus is to just prevent any unnecessary thoughts that can ruin enjoying the ""moment"" because that's when nothing is bothering you, you live in it/take it in and you embrace the flow and illusion of time, every little or big experience is way more worthwhile and meaningful. You just... live and let go. So I'm gonna experiment with this in a few hours and hope it's truly what I say it is."
"Where do I begin? Let's start at the beginning of this month. I have been on the move from 3rd, i got back home on 7th and then on 11th I was on the move again to get back home on 23rd of June. I stayed home for a day and then I had to go to another city to get back home on 28th. I did not see the wife or the kiddo unless we were chatting on video or she was texting me pictures of the kiddo up to kid stuff. I missed my boy the most. It feels like he has grown an inch taller and he has started speaking more words in the time that I was gone. Ever since he was born I never spent so many days away from him. Now that I am here and I am playing as much and spending as much time as I can with him. We play with cars and make the cars ""talk"" and he can do it all day.

My father got the hernia surgery done finally. I never thought he would, but somehow either he got enough courage or the hernia got uncomfortable enough that he had to get it done. It was a horrible experience for me and mom because we were sitting outside the OT and the operation that was scheduled to finish in 2 hours, took 4 hours. The 2 additional hours were hell because the nurse would not tell us anything and we had zero update. Finally, the doctor came out of the OT and told us that the surgery went fine and we could meet dad. We met him after half an hour. He was heavily sedated. Babbling. Groaning. And flirting with the nurses. No joke. Double hernia surgery and the minute consciousness is beginning to come back, his flirt mode is on. Jesus Christ, man...the nurses were younger than your own daughter and it was embarrassing. But what do you tell a patient? I stayed with dad till the stitches came out and there were other problems with his catheter and all. Oh god, it was all horrible. But he is okay now and taking meds for a UTI. And he is thinking of suing the hospital because he's got a bacteria in his urinary tract that is hospital borne. Hey, well. I am just glad that he got the surgery done even if he is grumpy and irritating as usual. It's a mental stress to see a parent in pain and then on a hospital bed. The one thing that I learned from all this is to take better care for my health so that my son won't have to see me in any condition.

&#x200B;

I got back home after that part of travel that stretched from 4 days into 12 and after a day I get the news that my maternal grandfather expired. He'd been sick for the longest time and was bedridden for about six months and I had to rush travel again to another city to be with family and pay my condolences. The bitch of it was that my father also had to travel there and he was just recovering from his surgery. But he did come, in pain and in discomfort. He was more whiney and attention seeking than always and I had to sit with him a lot and listen to his theories about every medical ailment and how the doctors don't know shit. He was even talking shit about the doctor who operated on him, because that's what he does. 

I know my own father talks shit about me behind my back, but what do you say to a parent in such a situation? I kept my mouth shut and spent the days that I was asked to spend there. My maternal grandfather was a good dude, pretty chill and fit till the end when all of a sudden he had some issue which escalated and the meds he took made his condition worse. He lost heart because he had always been a proud person but then to be dependent on the family and have an attendant to wipe him and empty his waste bags, I think that was what broke him on the inside. The family was expecting it, but that doesn't mean it hurt any less. Mother took it as stoically as she does everything. I feel sad for her the most. She is the rock of the family and without her, all of us would just fly away into nothingness.  

&#x200B;

All of this has been pretty emotionally wrenching and it doesn't end here. I have to move cities in the coming week. With a lot of stuff that we collected here in the past 5 years. Some of it is even older stuff. There are so many books that it is giving me a headache just thinking about it. How the hell am I going to transport all this 250kms away. Movers and Packers, for sure but I have never done a move on this scale. I came to this city with two bags that had my clothes and my laptop and I will leave with a truck full of stuff. Will I miss this city? fuck no. Will I miss the good times here? For sure. 

&#x200B;

One thing is for certain, the big city ain't for me. 

  
Anyway, to future adventures!"
"I was doing this exercise called inner child hypnosis to address my psychological issues arising out of being the golden child and the scapegoat, during different time periods. In the hypnosis, the instructor on youtube video, after relaxation, asked to create lot of memories of the past, and to go through them. I went with all the memories that came up automatically. They were all sad for some reason. Then he asked to pick one of them and to transition into deeper state of hypnosis. I remembered one specific incident, something that I do remember but never thought deep about it.

&#x200B;

I was sitting with some aunts and cousin sisters. They were talking and, I don't precisely remember the turn of events, but at some point I was told that I was acting feminine by sitting with girls. I guess they laughed on me or something. The place where I was living at that stage, it was just me and another kid, which I knew what he was up to. So, not much to do. In any case, I felt quite humiliated and rejected. I think I removed myself from that place, feeling humiliated and the reasoning that was given to me for this humiliation was that there is something wrong with me being curious about whatever being said.

&#x200B;

The instructor then told to talk to this younger self. I could see myself vividly, while recognizing my face. I could see that the kid, i.e. me, was sad and trying to find something to distract myself. I think it was around this time, that I got really interested in reading. I read every single story book I could put my hands on. 

&#x200B;

So, seeing him sad, humiliated and confused, I told him that there is nothing wrong with what he did. I told him that they were wrong to attack the kid in that way, and that he has every right to challenge them to answer or insult back. I still want to tell him that, he is too young to control his curiosities and expression and to understand those things. If I were there, I would fight for him and scold every single one of them to talking like that. Because, I think it was my mom, or one of my aunt that I considered almost my mom, that said that. So, I lost any sense of security there. 

&#x200B;

So, I tried to give this security to the kid. I would scold them and take this beautiful kid to teach him something. I could already see the kid smiling, on the thought of learning something new. You can tell that this kid just want to learn, and he is limited by the careless parenting. Just doing bare minimum required to be a parent. No sense of pride, security or love. I cannot remember myself being selflessly loved by my parent at any stage of my life. It always seemed forced, unnatural, fake, and without connection. I appeared out of place, if that means something. So, I told him the things that I learned. I promised him that I will give his future the joy of stories, music, sports and self-love. Yeah, right now it is just self-love. I guess I expanded that a little bit by including my younger self. 

&#x200B;

As I discovered one of my traumatic past event, I realized how it works and how it affects us and how we lose a part of our personality with that. So, when something happens and you feel hurt, but at the same time don't understand why, and it comes like a shock. Then we try to disconnect with that event, by disconnecting ourselves from that person. So, in my case, I disconnected with my child self a bit after that event. I think every single time, something like that happened, or I thought would happen, I would become very uneasy and defensive. In fact, it got me scared of talking to girls, because of that fear of mocking. I could never reply back and always appeared shocked when things like that happened. Too scared or scarred to respond. 

&#x200B;

So, when we disconnect with that past, we lose memories related to that past self, all the good ones as well.  We forget the event and things around that, and we are never prepared for that event. Because every time, things like that happens or you feel is about to happen, you are so scared that you cannot focus on things around you, and be aware of the situation. 

&#x200B;

So, when you reconnect with your inner child after these events, and console them, you give strength to that part of personality. I mean life can be thought of a sequence of recurring and non-recurring situations, and after making peace with younger self, you are more prepared than before for one of those recurring situations.    

&#x200B;

I also see a chance that I might appear a bit more aggressive if similar events occur now, to seek redemption of past inability to do so, or to avenge my younger self. And being aggressive will mean still not at peace with my past. I should be like any other person. In fact, you feel like you appear specially pathetic because you feel that everyone knows that you were always a loser. Because that is how you feel and you project it on others. Just take it normally like any banter and move forward. That is how it works for most cases. It is nothing more than that and it is not very important as well. 

&#x200B;

So, just realize that if you are feeling overwhelmed with emotions during one of these situations, that this is not you but the scared and hurt kid is reacting. Your responsibility is tell the kid that it is very normal and insignificant, and now he has you to feel protected."
"Went to my final onsite interview of the week. Well, actually, I'm heading to another face-to-face interview this Friday, but it's not for a job. I have a connection with a kind HR lady at a certain prominent hospital, and she's willing to hear me out on my qualifications for any possible open positions over there. She wants to see me this Friday morning, so, here we go again. 

The onsite interview for today was...uncomfortable. The job is for someone who's still finishing their college degree, more or less, and not necessarily for someone who's labeled a ""professional"" (I guess that's me) or at least someone with ""real-world"" experience. In other words, I'm overqualified, but the technician over there told me that, if the other positions I've applied for don't work out well, I can always pop over there with them if they're still accepting. Which brings me to my next worry: time. I have forks in the road to choose from in hearing back from one of these potential employers. Do I wait until I hear back from the ones I want? Or do I just go ahead and accept this, albeit lesser, position? What if I wait too long and it's already been filled out? I really don't like gambling with jobs like this. And, with such a competitive market, it'll be career-suicide for me to wait too long.  

See, this is why it's so important to build rapport with people in any industry or job sector. Even if you don't get a job with them, you'll have made an inside connection, maybe even a powerful one. That's why, for better or for worse, I'm as polite and professional as I can be with everyone I interview with. Even the assholes? Yes, even the assholes, because at the end of the day, they may be the ticket to getting your foot in the door. Honestly, I haven't had *too* many issues with folks, and I don't really take things personally unless their behavior is unethical, abhorrent or intolerable. In any case, I gotta play the waiting game...again.

I'm anxious to hear back from the other guys. I can imagine they'll either get back to me tomorrow or this Friday, or maybe even next week on Monday. My stomach is tying itself into knots as I type this all down. There really is nothing I can do at this point. I've sent ""thank you"" notes, followed up with everyone who's interviewed me so far, shook their hands and wore a nice suit and tie--I've done everything what others have advised me on. Now I just need to wait.

This is torturous. If someone were to ask me what my personal hell would be like, it would definitely be this. But, at least in hell, you know what's coming to you. This feels more like purgatory."
"  

His name is Doug… Douglas.   
 

He is tall, dark, and handsome. But that doesn’t really matter. What matters is that he is kind. He is refreshing, he is… patient?  
 We met weeks ago. At IHOP. Melissa and I had been at Guitars; it had been a raunchy night of gross men. We decided we needed food before we made the hour drive home. We headed for IHOP.  
 

We were seated by our waitress, I had eyes on a majorly attractive male, tan, muscular, and wild hair. Bright blue eyes, the kind of eyes you can’t ignore. I asked him to sit with us, if he wanted, while he waited for his to-go-order. He was cute or whatever. That’s about all I remember about the interaction.   
 

Melissa and I ordered an appetizer and gulped water in attempt to rehydrate. At some point I needed our waitress, “Hey!” I called, and looked at Melissa in desperation, “What was her name?” Melissa shrugged. I leaned out of our booth and stared down the aisle after our waitress not wanting to yell “Hey!” again. And, there he was, “Her name is Tess” he said, from across and down the aisle.   
 “Thank you!” I said with Genuine gratitude, and then “Tess!”  
 

After that it’s a blur, we ate, we laughed, after 2 hours we called for the check. Tess came over to quietly inform us that our bill had been paid for.   
 “What???” I said, “By who???”  
 She said oh, some handsome gentleman floating around here.   
 

The only males within line of sight, after having a look around, we at the booth, across the way and down the aisle from us. “Them?” I asked. Tess shrugged her shoulders as she gathers up dishes and walked away.   
 

“Hey! Did you pick up our meal?” I called, likely louder than I should have, the one that had told me the waitress’s name sank into the booth and the other one turned around and said “He did” pointing at the one shrinking into his seat.  
 

“Come sit with us! You paid for our meal! The least you can do is come sit with us!” I called, and they came. The shrinking one sat next to me, the other one say next to Melissa. Both were ridiculously good looking. Like, out of line good looking.   
 “What are your names?” Melissa and I both asked, the one next to Melissa was called Malik. The other remained silent. We chatted about where we had been that night, places we like to go drinking at, what they were in college for, etc.   
 

They got up to leave and again I tried to get his name, the one that sat next to me, and again he refused to give it. Then Malik said “Okay, DOUG! Let’s go” And then… they just left. Melissa and I sat there, both dumbfounded at the generosity of a stranger, and at the lack of need he had to take credit for it.   
 

As we talked and sipped out water, out of the corner of my eye I saw Malik walk back in. “Malik!” I called, again too loudly. He trotted over. “Is his name really Doug? Can you hook me up with his number or his Facebook?” Why I asked I have no clue.   
 

I am in love with being single. I have kids, and this guy is clearly way way younger than I am. He obviously didn’t want to be known. Still, I was compelled to ask. Malik offered to give me Doug’s Snapchat. I took it. He accepted immediately. I messaged him immediately, he replied, immediately.   
 

It’s been a 3 weeks now, of just chatting. He is refreshing. He doesn’t cuss, never once in any of our messages. He is respectful, more respectful than any man/boy that I have EVER known. Our conversation has been completely innocent. Day one to present. It’s all innocence, all purely getting to know each other.   


Last weekend I was back in town, back at Guitars. I told him I was local, we planned to meet at IHOP again. On my way I got pulled over, by the time the traffic stop was over Doug's group was leaving, it was 2am, so we missed seeing each other and I went home.   
 

Last night it became flirtatious, complimentary… last night we started talking about getting together and hanging out. I have started getting butterflies. I haven’t felt butterflies in years. I held back on how I was starting to feel and continued the banter.   
 Tonight we decided I would come and have dinner where he works. I joked and said it would give him a second chance to back up and see me with sober eyes.   
 He reminded me that the night we met he was sober and he had seen me, he told me I am gorgeous, and then he told me he couldn’t wait for me to come with the heart eyes emoji.   
 

“Boy, you are giving me all sorts of feels that I do not want” I replied. And after a second, “I should clarify, feels – butterflies. I still don’t want it”  
 

He has replied, but I haven’t opened it. I have no clue why. It doesn’t matter what he says because I am good with whatever. On the real, I don’t want the butterflies. I don’t want to like a dude. I don’t want to catch feelings for a dude. To me that just translates into pain, and I have come so far. I have healed so much.   
 On top of not wanting to feel a way about a dude, this dude is 21, he is in dental school, he is literally 21. And I … I am 33. I have 3 kids and he still doesn't know about them. Is it predictive thinking to think a 21-year-old guy wouldn’t want a pre-fabbed and truly complicated family? Yes, it is. Is it unhealthy thinking? Fucking yes, it is. But the reality, is that if I was 21, in college and without kids, it’s not something I would want. So it's fair.   
 

This is why, this is why I don’t want the butterflies, this is why I don’t want to catch feelings.   
 I would have stopped talking to him already, at the first hint of narcissistic behavior I will jet, at the first hint of an emotionally unhealthy male, I will turn and run. I know what I want. But this man, Doug… he is different. It’s so massively obvious, impossible to ignore different. And I want him, and I find myself wanting to know what his lips feel like against mine…   
 I find myself wanting him, after not wanting a single soul, after deflecting men for nearly 2 years, I find myself wanting this one, the wrong one, but, the oh so so right one…  
 

So here I am, with a Snap that I haven’t opened. Here I am trying to back myself up off the feels this guy is bringing out in me. Here I am trying not to picture myself wrapped in his long arms. Here I am… biting my lip, ‘cause I know I want him, and I shouldn’t."
"Today one of the friends was telling the story of how he pushed this other friend towards my love interest. The girl was interested in him, since the time we met. I was a tool for validation and entertainment. I was the one to fold first, so that is on me. Every single time, I feel that the girl is interested in me, and I will confess my interest for them too early. I cannot separate myself from the situation, and maybe remove myself for some time to see how it evolves. 

&#x200B;

Now I feel like shit knowing all this and how stupid I had been. I showed interest and not courage. I got too involved emotionally. I always knew what will happen, but I hoped against hope. I thought that I always left the scene on slightest sign of trouble, but I will hang around a bit this time. And I feel, this is not the way to do this. I do have social compulsions, but it goes as far as showing that you respect other people. If you are not comfortable, you are always allowed to leave. 

&#x200B;

But I still feel a bit angry with my ""friends"", who pulled me down. Disrespected me. Belittled me. I myself have done that sometimes, but I am sure I am quite aware most of the time to not do anything of this sort. But this is how world works. You will be tested all the time, and you have prove that you are courageous. I will not let anyone let me feel that I am weak. So, basically I am angry for not expressing my emotions for all those situations. There is a right and wrong way to show emotions. But this expression is very important, and without you will never learn the right way to do it.

&#x200B;

Look, the dice was always loaded against me. You are feeling bad that you didn't see it earlier and removed yourself from the situation earlier. I thought it was persistence, but it was basically a means for me to keep the hope alive. I couldn't see it die. It is fine. You also realized how people behave, and how to identify false friends and have minimal relation with  them. You don't have to be very popular but very good at what you do. You don't have to worry about impressing others. You should make yourself proud."
"Happy father's day! I wished my dad a happy and healthy one, and even bought him a gift for it. As usual, he wanted to decline it but I insisted. Then he went out to get drunk with mom. Like clockwork.

Anyway, dad asked me if a certain cousin of mine contacted me. Yes, once again, it's the failure of the family--*him*. No, I told him, he didn't contact me. He seemed relieved. I know why he brought this up, and it's because every year this cousin of mine writes a long-winded tirade on his Facebook page about his dead father. I know I sound like a jerk, but if you knew the man's history, you wouldn't feel any sympathy towards him. Long story short, he was abusive towards his father, constantly taking advantage of his kindness, all the way up to him being diagnosed with terminal cancer and dying on his deathbed. The man's deplorable by all accounts and even more.

Today was yet another rainy and miserable day. Rainy in June, in the summertime. It's been going on like this since April. It's fine in April, sure, but from May to now, this is ridiculous. It doesn't even feel like summer, save the immense humidity every now and then, but that usually invites thunderstorms and more clouds with it for rain. It feels like England here.

There's nothing really much to add. I have yet another phone screening tomorrow for another job. I'm not going to hold my breath anymore, because at this point, I'm expecting a miracle. We'll see how it goes. 

Yeah, nothing much else happened. Same old, same old. I wish I had more to write, but that's really it for today, I'm afraid. I suppose I could talk about things I've been asked by others in the past and write it down here. Okay, why not? 

Someone asked me what being on jury duty was like. I had jury duty for the first time in my life about two years ago, and let me tell you, it was one of the most depressing and boring things in the world. It's *nothing* like what you see on drama shows. The case was about a man who'd been accused of drunk driving. Skipping all the painful details the attorneys had already laid out, we ended up finding him guilty. The tension in that court room was so damn thick when we read out the verdict to the clerk. I really didn't want to be there and judge this man along with strangers. I couldn't look the man in the eyes when we read out the verdict. The judge thanked us for our service and we were escorted out of the room. I'm skimping on details because I don't want to write the whole experience down, but basically, it sucked. It was tiring, long and painful to do.

That's all I got for today."
"I am going to demand what I deserve. I might not come across smooth and confident, but I am not going to let it stop me from being assertive. I don't care. I know what I want. I know why I want. And I will go for it. I don't care if I won't get it, it is a real possibility, but I don't care. I am going to focus on my part of the business, and that is to be present and acting. 

&#x200B;

I am not going to let these voices in my head go unchecked that says that no one respects me, no one has ever love me and never will. I am not  listen to the voice saying that I am not capable enough in terms of brain and willpower to able to achieve anything significant. 

&#x200B;

I am going to challenge all of these claims by my bitch brain. Yes there were times that people have respected me and in the future there will me more of this. Yes, you will be ignored, disrespected all your life. There is nothing wrong with that. Focus on what makes you respect yourself. You are kind, honest and logical.  You can be more confident. You can sacrifice for others. You should sacrifice more for your own well being. 

&#x200B;

I have felt loved before. There were some inhibitions from my side, but yes I have felt loved. More importantly, I want to focus of accepting love. I will go for it while reminding myself of the possibility of failure and accepting it as a part of the process. 

&#x200B;

I am going to stand my ground and give it back to people disrespecting me. Not out of spite, but with the knowledge that if I am not happy with their behavior, I won't be able to sustain a good relationship with them. It is important to speak out when you are feeling more scared."
"How do people build up self-confidence? I am always unsure of myself, whether people will accept me or not. My dreams are full of abandonment by people who have been with me nearly my whole life. Spouses, children.  
Pathetic I know. I'm working on it."
"Yesterday I did a body experiment with myself and took a puff of weed. this again reinforced the fact that I don't really enjoy weed anymore. I mean it wasn't necessarily a bad feeling but just not what I used to enjoy so much. I can also tell that effects my stomach a lot more than it used to. I feel kind of bloated and my digestion feels labored. So yeah. overall not the best experience and I won't be doing it anymore. I'm realizing as I get older i just want to feel good all the time and my body working in a orderly proper fashion. Is that too much to ask? I don't think so. 

&#x200B;

What I will be doing is getting back in my meditative groove. daily meditations and self love. When I feel in optimal spirit everything else flows so easily. So getting back to that is a must. I was frustrated yesterday and let my emotions get the best of me. I couldn't keep an even keel which is what I need to do more of. Not getting picked up and waiting for 45 mins to play yesterday really fucked me up. this is a minor thing in life but i really let it upset my mood. Maybe it was also because I was bit hungry. Whatever the case may be, it really disturbed my zen state. I really let it get to me. Working through these issues is a must for me and will benefit me so much as the world continues to turn."
"So it’s officially study week at uni which means I’ve finished all my assignments, thank fuck. Pretty sure they sucked but hey I finished them! 

Had to go travelling to get my visa on Tuesday. It was an absolute disaster. Got lost looking for a locker to dump my bag. Couldn’t find it, had to get another taxi to a different locker place. Had 10 mins till my visa appointment. Couldn’t find the next damn locker. Finally found it, I’m already 20 mins late for my appointment at this stage. I’m ordering an Uber and he’s on the other side of the damn road. I walk over and he takes off. Then of course my phone go’s flat. I have to walk back to the locker get my portable charger and charge my phone. Legit took 30 mins for it to turn on again, in the mean time I’m trying to flag down a taxi. I get a taxi and my damn phone turns back on. Almost got run over in the process. Get to the appointment an hour late. I’m in line for another hour. Get there and they tell me my photo isn’t current enough. I have to find a post office to get my photo taken, and of course get lost on the way. The photo cost me more money and I look fucking terrible. It’s been raining so my hair has gone curly and frizzy, and to make it worse the lady insisted my chin be in the damn air for the photo. After I finish the appointment I’m almost in tears, I’d just had enough. Oh yeah and guess who’s flight was at 5:30am? Oh and did I mention I got 0 hours sleep? I get an uber back to the locker, get my damn backpack bc you couldn’t take one to the visa place, then get another uber to the airport. I think I’m about $150 in transport fees at this stage? Oh yeah and the visa place decided to charge me another $200. So basically my budget is fucked. 

Anyways I get to the airport and of course I have 9 hours there till my flight 🙃 I almost fell asleep on a crappy plastic chair several times. It was a really fucking long day. To make things worse of course I bloody emailed my ex again. No reply, the usual. Almost sent another one too, I got super emotional the other night, I blame this time of the month. 

Anyways, I’ve got to ring the visa place tomorrow bc of course I screwed something up and ring the delivery place to get my damn passport back, as if the visa place takes it! I also need to start studying for my exams, I have two within the next weekish? Then another one like two weeks later. Only three this semester, thank fuck. Mm and yep that’s about it. Still busy but not as busy, yay."
"It’s been a while since I posted, I guess that’s a good thing though. I’m super busy, it’s the last week of uni for this semester. I have two giant scientific reports to do. I’ve got an extension on one but it’s still not enough time really. The data analysis on both of them has been difficult. I hate Rstudios. So I’m super stressed. I feel constantly panicked and I’ve got a sore leg like I always do when I’m stressed. When I’m stressed I can’t work. My brain doesn’t function. So I have to take a break. But I can’t relax in the break because I’m like omg I have so much work to do, anddd the cycle continues. I’ll get through it though, I seem to always pull it off somehow. 

With that guy I was seeing casually, he still isn’t going out with that girl, so I’m still seeing him. He says I’m not stopping him from going out with her, but who knows. Anyways that’s about it for now."
"**Chapter 3 - ""Willfulness and Feminist Subjectivity""** 

&#x200B;

**Entry 1 - Hands**

**""...protest and punishment share the same terms""** (Ahmed, 81).

The most important part of the body is the hands. We understand the world with our hands. We work with our hands. Show affection with our hands. Create with our hands. Our hands have an extremely high density of nerve endings that allow for us to use them as tools to perform daily tasks and navigate our way through our existence. Our fingertips help us create long-lasting and detailed memories that we can continue to call upon for reference throughout our lives. Right now I am imagining the bark of a tree and what it would feel like to run my fingertip over it. The memory of its texture is so vivid that it feels as if I am touching the rough and uneven surface all over again. Its hills and valleys, the occasional feeling of damp moss clinging to the trunk, every bit is accounted for. From here, more memories come back to me. Where I was when I felt my fingers graze the bark, what I was doing, who I was with. 

As I reflect back on my first entry of my reading log, I think of how feminism is sensational. It is felt, deeply and fully. I call this previous reading back to mind as I begin to think about the significance of hands, more specifically hands of feminists. If feminists feel things and create memories and understandings from what they have felt, the role hands and arms play in this process is essential. What we do and do not do can be seen as forms of willfulness and protest, and with hands being the tool for doing, they become the center point of such actions. I will not pick up your calls for you. I will construct rather then sit passively. I will not cook your dinner tonight. I will raise my fist in protest. 

While our hands and arms are tools, they are seen as valuable commodities. Ahmed uses the example of  laborers who come to see their arms and hands as symbols of their contribution to wealth an mistreatment of workers rather than extensions of themselves. In this way, our greatest tool can be used against us. 

When we ask others to perform tasks that allow for us to gain more leisure time, we are taking that time away from their own lives. When I first read this in Ahmed's chapter, I began to think about the ways in which I have inadvertently asked someone to use their own hands for my own personal gain. Ironically enough, an example of when I have done this is when I got a manicure.  I am capable of painting my own nails, and it is something I do on my own often, but there are times where I choose to pay someone else to do it for me. Why? Is it laziness? The desire to not have to do something so commonplace for myself? What I find to be the most ironic about this example is that the person who I had paid to make my hands look ""presentable"" must use their hands to do so. While I cannot say for certain, I imagine that the person who did my nails did not have any nail polish on their fingers. My hands were the driving force behind her hands working. For that brief time, it was as if I possessed her hands. 

To make matters worse, the thought of looking down at my freshly polished nails made me feel as if my hands were out of service. Wouldn't want to break a nail would we? The length of the nails I asked for made it nearly impossible to pick anything up or perform daily tasks such as taking out my contacts without fear of poking my eye out. It was here that I realized how much I used my hands for. I spent the next few weeks desperately wishing I had my short and unpainted nails back. I wanted to use my hands again. This made me think further as to how nail salons are predominantly seen as female spaces where the clientele and the workers providing the service are mainly women. Women are in an out of nail salons all day long, the workers never fall short of services to provide. When observing the practice of getting your nails done for strictly aesthetic purposes, I wonder if it can be seen as a way of keeping women from using their hands in more powerful ways. The women using their hands to carry out the service are given a pass to use their hands because they are ultimately playing a role in the detachment of women from their hands as tools. In a society where the quest for male approval relies heavily on aesthetics and a woman's worth is determined by her relativity to a man, it is no wonder that women continue to unwillingly forfeit their hands at the price of adhering to stereotypical beauty ideals and compliance to patriarchal values."
"At the end of last year, the area I lived in was hit by the Camp Fire, which became the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in Californian history. The fire-wall was just at the edge of my city, and destroyed most of my hometown, Paradise. I was forced to move due to how many displaced people there were in Chico, and because my landlady was forcing people out to bring in displaced people. My dad, who lives in Oregon told me I could move in with him and my step-mom for a while, until I got back on my feet.
  
It has been pretty slow going, and employment is hard for me to find because many employers do not have support systems in place for people on the autism spectrum (which I am) and so their work environments are not suitable for me. They are all too fast paced and overwhelming, and I require slower pace and much quieter workspace. 

I applied to Disabled Adult Services a while ago, and they still have yet to make a decision as to whether they'll take me on. But it seems likely they will, which will be a big help! They can connect me with organizations that help disabled and autistic people find stable employment and job training! 

I have also been receiving mental health counseling for my depression, which like always is slow going as far as improvement to my mental health goes. My doctor has me on Wellbutrin, which works well enough. I am also going through HRT as part of my transgender transition. It has only been a couple months since I started, so no major changes yet.

Hopefully by the end of this year, I'll be where I want to be! ☺️"
"It can be heartbreaking and humbling to know that I have made a wrong choice in life. Or several wrong choices. I try to look back to connect the dots and it's a jumble of bad choices, weak choices, safe choices. And that's what brought me here. No job, the work is there, but it's back-breaking and getting money from clients is even more of a drag than the actual work. My career path is shot to shit because I took a break after fucking up my mental and physical health in a safe job that involved a whole lot of sitting around. I never took enough risk. I got along with the first girl who showed me any attention and I was so much in love that I wanted her more than anything in the world. I went against the wishes of my parents and whatever ridicule the group of friends were throwing at me, fuck all of them, I said then. This girl is my one and I want to be with her. 

&#x200B;

Oh, I was so stupid and so in love I never saw the red flags and that I was getting into a relationship with a broken individual with her own emotional blockades. I saw that a little, but I thought love, care and attention will help me break through those barriers. But sometimes, even if you repair what's broken, the cracks remain. I should have seen the overly-possessive, lazy, unorganized person that she is, but I didn't. Love had cast a blanket of roses on my eyes and her every fault seemed charming and lovable.  I know at some level, she loves me, but it's a very need-based love. It's like she loves me only when she needs me, and doesn't care or understand what I need. It's so difficult to explain or put into words. It's love, but it's a tepid love. There is no fire or fierceness in it and when I try, I am shot down at every step. It's heartbreaking and disturbing.

&#x200B;

Now, I am filled with doubt and fear that is this how I want to live the rest of my life? I can't even make myself think about separating from her because it will hurt her so much. I have to repair this relationship by trying to communicate better. 

&#x200B;

I've been sad and non-communicative after the one minor disagreement we had some days ago. Same thing we've been discussing ever since we got married and she just plain told me, ""i'll do it for you, but I will not do it happily."" So, now I am the monster for asking? Probably, I have always been the monster here. 

&#x200B;

Some days, that old feeling of buying a motorcycle and disappearing somewhere in the hills rears up its ugly head so strongly that I can't think of anything else. But I can't run. I am not going to run. I am going to make it work. Whatever it takes."
"I like my job most days. As with every job it has its ups and downs, it has its unbearable customers and its annoying coworkers. But lately I feel like it is draining me, pulling my down into a spiral of exhaustion that I'm struggling to overcome. I don't know what I need to make it better.  I feel like falling into a deep sleep for many days and nights, I imagine waking up and feeling refreshed. 

Lately I feel so happy with 'A' around, that when he's gone I feel like i'm crashing from a sugar high. Perhaps that's part of it all, I don't know."
"Sometimes, there are days, while listening to music and/or going on hikes, I feel the entire world rests within my consciousness or experiences. There’s just something about music or being out in the wilderness that brings a state of realization that what I experience in my head is mine alone: anything from the awe of taking it all in, the fatigue of reaching a certain point, everything that led up to this point and the feelings that snowballed me into this conscious experience, it’s all mine. Even if somebody else is present, they have their own reasons and have made their own decisions, based off their own feelings. It’s times like this that make me feel most personal, like no amount of intimacy could ever share how unique this experience is, while simultaneously feeling most selfish; selfish because in these movements, I feel as though the whole world belongs to me. I’m not sure why I feel this way, it could just be an awareness of myself or maybe it’s just a thing that happens when the right conditions are present. At the moment, I do not think it is a necessarily dangerous train of thought, but it’s one that sometimes derails moments of productivity, as it just did before writing this"
"April already- it's almost your birthday again. Although I know I can't change what happened, I still think about everything I did wrong. Regrets are many, moments of peace are few. Oh, how I wish I could turn back the clock and be a better person. Not possible though.

Immaturity is the reason for who I was, but I still take full responsibility for my actions. My punishment is well-deserved.

Sadly, I am having these revelations too late. Occasionally I find myself wallowing in self-pity over these realizations that what has been broken can never be fixed. Regrets, regrets. Remembering the good times we had is bittersweet, as I know they will never again be had, and you will never know how much I truly wish we could have met each other when the timing was right. Yesterday has passed us by and you are drifting further and further into the past- so long, Peach Pie."
"My heart that I have finally become acquainted with begs me to listen but I manipulate my brain to remember how we met. My heart surrenders and communicates with the rest of my body to prepare for destruction, remembering their places and how they will get me back to homeostasis. Attempting to explain, my heart cuts me off and calms me with the support of the rest of my body, letting me know they understand why I am doing this and that they will be there to support. I smile and then lay in my bed, soon sinking into a daydream of something. 

We will get to bed and he will turn his back to me instead of hugging my body to cuddle. He will maintan the distance throughout the night. When we wake up it will be early enough for him to get in one last fuck from me. we finish and he silently gets up to clan himself in another room. The shattering of my last burst of hope that he will recover briefly next to me, finally enjoying the moment. The last army of confidence I pulled from deep inside me to not give up gave everything they had, only to be hurt by him.  I deep down inside want to tell him I don’t want to leave but I already observe the change in behavior in him and how he wont even look or talk to me. So I finish packing. He politely offers breakfast but I deny because the more time I spend with him means me not being able to touch him like I want. This rips me apart inside and makes me want to drop to my knees because it hurts so bad. So he takes me to the airport. And I instantly open the door, rubbing my bag trying to avoid looking at him one last time but I glanced at the corner of my eye to see him barley looking over his shoulder only to make sure I was closing the door. No kiss from him. No resting of his hand on my thigh rubbing up and [down. no](http://down.no/) glances over in my dirction. No conversation. No arm extending out to grab me and pull me inside for a kiss before I head out. No parking of his car to help grab my bags and give me a hug and kiss goodbye. 

I got out of the car as if I exited an uber. 

&#x200B;

I walked several steps before I started to turn my head where my eyes could see what was left behind me, hoping he would be waiting to make sure I made it inside... I saw no sign of his car... Not even the scene of him driving far away.. I couldn't help but then stop to be pulled in to where I was left and stare out to the emptiness to remember as if it never housed a car in the first place. This would be the final siren going off that its all gone. No trace of any encounter would ever be able to be traced back. So I made the best of that emptiness that housed more than what it displayed to feel anything that remained. I turned and entered the sliding doors and stopped and sat on the bench inside the airport in a daze of what to do for the next 7 hours, alone."
"Its frustrating. We go through life and life brings us changes. Life continues  with these changes and never skips a beat. People are constantly creating these changes and bouncing them around everywhere. Its total chaos if you you think about it but completely oblivious to the human eye. How we react to these changes develop the future changes to come. Everything that us presented to us holts us in our lives. they never go unnoticed. We decide the roll of changes in our lives. this is what creates who we are. builds our backbone. Builds our character. What is wild is that some of these changes stop us and start becoming in charge that we lose control of keeping up with life rollin along casually and chill. Life doesn’t let anything ruin its flow. It understands we need that in order for the world to spin. Change is taken care of so carefully because of the change we are afraid of that could happen to us if we don’t react the right way to this change we are handed with. Damn if you think about it we are almost juggling all these changes like a cartoon character sweating and tumbling around and over adjusting and watching these changes so carefully making sure they don’t break or fall creating that chaos we have painted so perfectly fearing the change. But while this is happening other shit is around us and we don’t even know that we are making it through OTHER changes in our life but just don’t consider them as detrimental to us like these changes we are going above and beyond for. But then what happens when ONE of these changes fall? Every single detail of the painted assumptions of the changes we have been juggling all of a sudden melt, transforming colors, blends, textures; soon regaining its solid form to do what its expected of: giving us a show. But these new paintings keep their colors. They never get rid of a color that was used for that specific painting given, just adapts to whatever is made from the melted blends that have solidified back to its original form. This right here ensures its still the same…the same colors displaying our assumptions we have been juggling so with so carefully and are still there…the colors have just been exposed to an environment not acclimated to creating its new display. Our new display holds on to the past color formations of our assumptions, remaining the same, just now displaying a new show for us of what that one drop of change did to the colors of our assumptions. its complete chaos that is trying to be taken ahold of, settled down, and constructed to a smooth cycle balanced and clean. Making sure we remember all that happened to our past blends of colors is how we believe we keep in check and avoid being unprepared for the disturbances to melt our colors. What an incredible responsibility we have made so important to us. Its so large.. we have literally taken responsibility of being the one able to create that balance. That is incredible confidence in ourselves! We know what is going to happen from these changes so we take over the responsibility and know exactly what to do based off of past experiences. Kind of impressive we are able to live in the past and future disregarding whatever the fuck the present is. I mean why the fuck would we if we already know what the future is going to look like because our past has already told us everything we need to know, so fuck it lets blast on ahead this bitch. Damn, and then of course we know what we look like while doing this and let me say, it looks dope as hell. 

Jesus fuck. Can you imagine how fucking WILD we look like? Our mother fucking asses believe we can see in the future because of our past experiences, which tell us EVERYTHING apparently, and confidently take ownership of the balance of a fucking human life by altering the fucking composition of our earth to tame change and put it in its place we believe it deserves to be in.

I guess this is where we separate ourselves from others. Believing what is important to us and how well we take care of whats important to us. Change then is morphed into however we want in order to protect “important”….

Kind of makes me wonder why we would disregard the present when ultimately the present and the calm flow of consistency of life are ridin together with each other this whole time while we choose to focus within the future and past. We have the ability to live in that balance life just by choosing to join the ride with the present. 

That sounds pretty good to me. driving along the coast of California in my black customized tahoe with the sunroof open and windows down just right on a two way blacktop with the sunset hanging out right next to me enjoying the nice breeze of orange blossums and fresh air, playing “throw some D’s on that Bitch” soothe my ears from the sound system I have to perfectly shape that smile on my face and gangster lean in the car, traffic at just a hint if any, to wherever."
"it's 3 am in the morning, and you just had to come to my mind. How long has it been that I started to remember you? six years maybe more, and ever since my head cant seem to let go of you and keep adding more memories to it, of Sherry, Palm, Liline, Kheera, and most importantly, You,, oh how everytime those fragments of memories comes back to my head, the more I miss you, the more I long to meet you. I want to see you, I want you to meet my beautiful wife, I miss everything we do together, I want you to know that I'm living a happy life now with a very caring and lovely wife, how's yours?, are you happy?, do you eat well?, I hope to see your laugh again, to see you smile again, but honestly I don't know what would happen if we're to meet again, I would probably fainted, I would probably cry, I would probably not able to move a muscle out of the unspeakable joy that I would felt, don't you want to find out? please if in the astronomical chance that you would read this, let it be known.. that I want to see you again, Rena"
"It's 3:38am. Didn't get much done today, only really got through maybe 3 pages of SAT Math refresher, I really need to get back on that. 6 months to go before Test Day. I hope this works out in my favour.

I read a thread on Twitter lately, on fawning and basically the idea of being the sort of people-pleaser who relinquishes control of opinions/behaviour/everything as a form of de-escalation, in order to gain validation from someone. And how this can often be born from a chaotic or otherwise controlling childhood environment, where the person grows up with the idea that if they were just ""good"" enough or ""small"" enough, the conflict will be resolved. 

These sort of people who fawn over others and relinquish their own autonomy or boundaries etc. tend to do this out of fear, and not as a manipulative tactic (unlike guilt-tripping), and it takes on a completely different form i.e. Agreeing to every favour, agreeing with a person, becoming an emotional chameleon. 

People like these are hence, extremely vulnerable to emotional abuse, because they feel as if they have to ""work"" for the love or validation, and cannot comprehend common or normal expressions of love that comes ""too easily"". 

I'm not sure about this. According to my parents, nothing really went wrong with me until I was 9 years old. I don't really remember much from my childhood years, I don't remember anything, really. So maybe I'll never know if my childhood had a role to play. I just know that the thread hit me where it hurt. I mean, yeah. Maybe that's why my mantra is ""Please Don't Be Kind To Me, I'm Scared"". 

Maybe I should bring this up with my counsellor. She'll know what to say. But until then, I guess this is how it's gonna be. 

I made supper. It's mashed potatoes with bacon and eggs. I better go to bed."
"Holy hell. Last night I thought I was going to die. My entire bowel unloaded itself inside my toilet. Seriously, it just kept going and going--I honestly thought I was going to die on the toilet. It was horrible...I was on my way home from a restaurant I normally frequent and all of a sudden it felt like a bunch of worms were stabbing me inside my gut. God Almighty, it killed me to no end. By the end of it all, my legs and knees were shaking. It's because I ate a 10-inch pizza by myself the day before. I know, I know, it was incredibly stupid on my part for doing that. All that bread and salt just absorbed all of the water in my intestines and--you know what, I'm gonna stop right there.

Well, with all of that being said, I'm alive and okay. To be honest, I actually forgot what else happened last night because of that disgusting episode I had. Seriously, I'm going to be traumatized from my colon escapade.

I'll just leave this entry here for now and think about what comes next tomorrow...and hopefully nothing feces-related. "
"I feel tense today. I don't know why, and I had a good day so I've nothing to complain about. Rather, I *should* have nothing to complain about, but here I am. I've been exercising every day almost and I've been feeling much, much better because of it. Yet, I still feel like I want to rip out of my skin, if that makes any sense. Yeah, the way I put it makes it sound creepy, but that's the best way I can describe it. Well, here I go again, then--time to harp on and on about how my job sucks...*again*. No, I'm gonna skip out on that for today.

I really don't have much to add today, but there was something that happened last night that scared me. I was down in my basement getting something when I heard this, what sounded like, whispering in my ear. I almost had a heart attack, and I'm sure it was nothing more than me picking up something else. I'm not a believer in the paranormal, but that whisper sounded like it was saying my name. I think I'm going crazy. I need to get out more, and no, work doesn't count. 

Yeah, that's it.

I think my loneliness is getting to me."
"Dear Diary

Another dreary rainy day. And a lazy Sunday to boot. I just finished a TV series, all caught up. Now I get to wait until the next season comes out. I really hate this feeling of waiting. This is why I quit watching shows in the past. And for all I know may force me to stop again in the future.

Funny... I don't feel this way when reading books. There's really not that much difference... at least to me. I guess that's part of my problem.

Ah well. As well be shall be, yeah?

No sotd today... not feeling very musicy. I'd like to do some kind of rain themed song... But nah. Not today."
"Dear Diary.

Sorry, diary.  I'm not feeling creative today.  So a bland so-so title. I'm sure we'll both manage to survive.  

Therapy today.  Really didn't want to do it.  I honestly wonder how much more I'm going to do.  Anger issues are better, as I'm not reacting like I was a few weeks ago.  Does that mean I don't need therapy any more?  Probably not.  

But I'll keep going.  I know it's not a linear progression.  Always better, never getting worse.  I know that I may be worse one day, and better others.   The important thing is to have more better days than not better ones.  

'Not better'.  Some nice 1984 double speak there.

Ah well.  I have more to say, but can't really be arsed to say it right now.  Sorry, Diary.  Nothing personal.  Just don't see the reason.

"After a wild and slightly stressful past few months, luck and happiness has showered me the past two weeks. Last week I interviewed a a really nice daycare program. I was given a 2,000 bursery when I didn't know I could afford next month's rent (I only applied for 1,000). Then my taxes return estimate was more than expected and they helped me get set up for rent assistance. My mom spent the night at my place, took me out for supper and we got our nails done. I'm even talking to a guy who is really nice and actually mature. I started painting for my mom's birthday that I'm really excited about and proud of. Good 2 weeks. :)"
"Dearest Diary of mine,

&#x200B;

As the days count down towards spring break. I am starting to feel those ANTS creeping back into my head. They are powerful, they are angry and they are coming for me. 

&#x200B;

Sorry, I forgot that I'm posting on Reddit. ANTS is an anxiety thing, it's a short version of the full name; Automatic Negative Thoughts. These are the worse case scenarios that pop in someone's atypical brain after thinking about it for a while. For me, they are the first thing that I'm thinking of when something goes wrong. 

&#x200B;

I hate thinking like this to be honest. It's something that I've struggled with for years. But even on medication they never seem to fully stop. 

&#x200B;

Tomorrow I hope to feel better. I hope to get all my laundry done, clean up my room and get all my homework done without whining or complaining. Going in and forcing myself to do things that would make me resemble something of a fully put together human being. 

&#x200B;

It's getting late and there's no way I'm doing anything at 1:45am. Goodnight. 

&#x200B;"
"Dear Diary

Such a silly phrase!  Oh, I get it.  All down hill from here!  But down hill to what?  Yes, Diary, I know.  The weekend.  But what's so great about the weekend?  We just get to do this all over again!  And in 168 hours we're right back here.  

We do a lot of silly things though.  It's how we cope.  I cope with my job by saying I'm going to quit all the time.  But the truth of the matter is about a third of my problems with my job are self created and the other parts I have zero control over.  I try not to worry too much about stuff I can't control.  But the depression issues lead to anger issues leading to me getting upset over that.  Sometimes very vocally.  And who do I complain to?  People who can't do a bloody thing about it.  So why do I do it?  Coping, probably.

I haven't been very good this week, Diary.  I'm going to be 'in trouble' with my therapist because I didn't do my homework.  Well, I did half of it.  Arguably, in my not so very humble opinion, the harder half.  Also the part that is hardest to prove.  But I get what the exercise is for - self realization.  And that part I'm getting better at.  So I'm going to call that one a win and roll with it.  Lord knows I need all the wins I can get right now.

In honor of hump day, the sotd is *Working For the Weekend*.  A catchy oldie but goodie.  To some people at least.  "
"I am trying to forget what happened last night. Not because it was terrible, but it was something that was dragging me back. Something that was bringing out of my anger towards him and into his arms with his hands on my stomach, talking about movies and TV and every little thing. He says that he doesn't like his body. I told him I don't like my body but he told me I had no reason to.  

&#x200B;

There's a difference between not liking your body and feeling like a mis-formed bag of meat. Feeling as if you had been cheated out of something greater and something that had a sense of a normal childhood with normal things. 

&#x200B;

Spring Break starts the 16th, and I want to get out of here so bad. "
"What a full day I had today.

It started with dropping off my laptop at the service station. I'd been having issues with my WiFi and after weeks of unsuccessful troubleshooting I decided I might as well start with a fresh install. Since the price of SSDs have been going down I opted to have one put in. And since we were opening up the laptop I asked them to throw in more RAM. The final price was very reasonable.

After breakfast I had to run some errands at the bank. Well, two banks actually and fortunately they were across from each other. It was generally easy-going but it took time, it was lunch by the time I was done.

After a quick lunch and a rest I was ready to go again. That's when the service station called to tell me my laptop was ready for collection. I used it all afternoon and this baby runs smooth. I finally understand why people love SSDs.

Hit the gym the late afternoon. I'm really happy with my overall exercise regime which currently includes gym and running/sprinting during the week. I want something else though, something fully-body, but I haven't quite found it yet.

From the gym it was off to choir practice. This is one of the few activities I do for the sheer pleasure of it. We've got a small performance coming up at the end of the month and as usual I feel we haven't practiced enough. But like I said, I do it for the sheer pleasure of it.

Which brings us to the here and now, winding down for the evening. Tomorrow is another day."
"Dear Diary.

Seriously!  Why?  "
"I went out to eat again, or rather I went to eat and tried to find some piece of mind.  Didn't bother going to any bars this time, especially on a Saturday, considering how many turds I would end up meeting like the other night.  I'm in a better mood now, but something feels off.  I dunno...I feel empty again.  I'm too insecure to say what it is because I know exactly what it is.  It's my depression, or at least what remains of it.  Thankfully, I've gotten much better over the years, but it's still residual, among the other kinds of pain I still carry with me.  Little things like these diary entries do help me overcome it, but it's not like it exactly boosts neurochemicals in my synapses.  And I'd rather not go back on the SSRI, because fuck that.

Anyway, I did meet an old high school friend of mine last night.  I actually met her a few months prior and I did recognize her face, but I was too shy to ask if she was really my old friend.  She recognized me and asked me if I was who I was.  She seems like a happy girl, but the story she told me was sad.  She went into art school and, long story short, she was bullied by her peers, among other things I'm sure.  She dropped out and decided to take up on hair dressing, but she's currently working retail at the mall.  She was always such an energetic sweetheart and still is.  I hope to meet her again sometime soon!

I don't know why people are so cruel to each other...well, no, that's not true.  I can hazard to guess why because I've been in that position before.  I just don't want to think too much about it for my own sanity.  I'm not going to live forever and neither are the folks who harass people like my old high school classmate--I don't have time to deal with their bullshit.  People are so damn petty.  The other night I was watching the news on how a guy killed another man in a parking lot over a parking spot.  The murderer got out of his car and confronted the irate motorist and ended up punching him so hard in the face, he killed him.  The victim was in his late 20s, while the perp was in his 30s.  What a stupid, stupid way to lose your freedom.  

I really should stop looking into ""bad"" news, but I suppose it's unavoidable.  Our world's always been like this, so I try to stay out of that as much as possible.  But even when I think I'm out of it, I get sucked into some bizarre situation.  My friends jokingly say it's an ""adventure"" for me, and while that may be true for an observer, it's not comfortable at all.  I should just strap a camcorder to my chest everyday and document everything.  All joking aside, it has gotten better.

It's starting to snow again, and this sleepy feeling is coming back.  I should get some rest."
"I woke up a little too early today.  No work for me today, thankfully.  The boss called in sick--some kind of ""stomach virus"" or whatever.  Not that it matters anyway, the only thing we had to do was data entry and analysis, which is something I can easily do from home.  Hope he gets better.  I know I've been ragging about how I hate this job, but the guys I work with are honestly decent people.  Like I said before, it's just the nature of the work, not my coworkers that is the issue.  

I spoke with the doctor yesterday via phone and, well, he pretty much told me the same advice everyone's told me time and again: keep applying for those high positions, and keep on making connections internally.  Thankfully I've been doing just that.  He also offered to give me connections of his own from guys who're working in their respective companies, should I be willing to take it.  I've got a lot to keep track of, but it couldn't hurt to shoot a message or two to some of these people in regards to whatever it is that they're working on.

There is always the option of going back to academia, but academia pays shit.  I also don't want to make a 2-year commitment with some Professor or Doctor Jackass who isn't going to be in the lab a majority of the time.  No thank you.  God, that reminds me of that turd I spoke with about a year ago in regards to a position in his lab.  Christ, what a condescending shithead he was.  And he wonders why no student or junior researcher wants to be with him.  Hint, hint, doc: your attitude is garbage!  The guy was a stereotypical mad scientist, I swear.

There is another option, too, but I don't want to take it up.  Yeah, going through contracting companies.  I'll run into oncoming traffic if I have to deal with any of those vultures again.  The only good recruiter I've met so far is that lady.  She seems genuine in helping me get a perm position with a company and not just interested in making sales commissions.  The majority of recruiters or ""headhunters"" (barf) I've dealt with in the past have been nothing but pushy, rude and predatory.  Ugh...forget about it.

And then, of course, one of my neighbors has been drunk driving again.  Great.  The biggest irony of all is that the guy is a criminal defense attorney, if you can actually believe it.  Yeah, and he defends clients who've been accused of DUI all the time.  You can't make this up.  I know he has a problem, but his ignorance is going to get somebody killed one day.  I don't care how ""good of a driver"" he is even when he's drunk.  If he gets into an accident whether or not it's his fault, the cops are gonna find out and his license will be in jeopardy.

Why am I getting so worked up on other peoples' lives?  I don't even know why I bother sometimes. "
"I got a call from my dumbass cousin a few weeks ago...again.  I think calling him a ""dumbass"" is being too generous.  He's a *real* piece of work, and even that's still being generous.  I really don't want to talk too much about him because everyone in the family--and in his hometown--knows he's the village shithead.  I wish that poor girl would divorce him, but I can't even imagine what her feelings must be like being stuck with that lunatic.  And, of course, I don't want to be remotely involved with *anything* in that guy's life.  I'm glad his father isn't around to see this anymore.  And I'm also glad he's not coming back here, and if he does, it'll be a short-lived visit, I can tell you that.  He's not getting anywhere near this house, period.  What a fucking bum.  He sits on his ass all day while his wife busts her ass for him.  He's the textbook definition of a loser, among other reasons.

Then there's my neighbor.  God, don't even get me started on that guy.  I've given up on him entirely.  If he's not going to go in for psychiatric care and take his medicine, he's just gonna get worse and worse as he ages.  He's emotionally disturbed and unhinged, just like my cousin.  But at least, for some part, this one has an excuse because he can't somewhat control it.  

I don't even know why I bring these guys up.  Honestly, I sometimes feel like I should just move out from this place and never come back.  I guess my insecurities and fear of changing to a new environment are keeping me at bay.  Oh well, we'll see how it goes along.  Oh, and good news: the guy who offered me the position got back to me yesterday.  He said him and I will have lunch somewhere with each other and, hopefully, he'll take me under his wing with the senior researchers to train me.  If it's an internship that's short, I really don't mind.  As long as I get paid and have the chance in getting in full-time and perm, I'm A-okay with it."

Well, last night wasn't much better.  That's all I have to say about that.

"Dear Diary:

A pretty skinny friend of mine just came from the sauna (this is Germany=everybody 100% naked in sauna). 

While he sat there an old, hairy & heavy stranger entered, approached him and said: ""Buddy, you are sitting on my place. I go here regularly and this is my usual seat."" 
My friend answers: ""No. The sauna is full!"" 

Without flinching the stranger settled down his hulking sweaty body on my friends lap. 

Sorry for possible typos but I am still laughing and can barely see through my tears 😂. Thought the story might belong here. If not please give advise.

PS: Stranger got banned after that.

"Feeling particularly crappy today. I’ve been away from home, going to school for a career that should have me set. I miss my life back home and I miss innocence. I’m scared that I’m going to make the wrong decisions while working in my career and not being able to forgive myself for them. I’m scared of feeling like letting those closest to me down because they expect me to be so much more than them or because I told them I could handle the pressure.

I’m also tired of trying to label myself as something I thought I always knew but may turn out not to be true. This label used to help me cope with trying to be who I am but now it feels like it limits my potential or in some cases just doesn’t fit me at all. And I’m tired of feeling like pulling this label out to absolve myself when I feel it is necessary or to save face. 

I’m scared of feeling like I’m letting people down, like I’m not trying hard enough, or when I genuinely try, it still isn’t enough. "
"Dear Diary

Blech.  It's too fucking early for this.  

It doesn't help I woke up with that ""This is not the reality I want to be in"" thing again.  Upset that I wasn't in whatever dream world I was just in, and happy.  Stupid thing is, I never remember my dreams.  People go on and on about their dreams.  Crazily detailed dreams.  I barely remember the soda I was drinking.

Sorry, Diary.  I'm just not feeling it right now.  Maybe later.  

Song of the day: *No Rain* - Blind Melon.  I envy that guy.  He got sleep.  And then the eternal sleep.  I'm not quite ready for that sleep.  At least, that's what I keep telling myself.  "
"Dear Diary.

So, Diary, I have homework.  Homework!  Sam wants me to write down my feelings and how I feel about them.  Sounds weird, I know, Diary, but it kinda makes sense to me.  I think Sam called it cognitive behaviour therapy.  Learning how to know what I'm feeling so I can adjust my thoughts or something like that.

It sounds so much to me like ""Just think happy thoughts!""  Yeah, right.  We all know that doesn't work.

Yet at the same time I don't really understand all these thoughts and emotions in my mind and heart.  It's always been easier to mask that with anger or apathy and not deal with it.  So maybe stopping and thinking about it may be good for me to get a handle on what's going on around me and stop this feeling of spinning out of control.

I feel such a dichotomy in my consciousness.  On the one hand I want control of things around me so things are safe and predictable.  On the other hand I'm just a leaf in the wind.

Yes, Diary, I know how that ended up.  And there are times I feel that spear racing towards me.  To further the dichotomy paradigm, I want so desperately to get lost in that darkness, and so very strongly fear it.

So today, Diary, you need to call me Axl.  Because I feel like him at the end of *Sweet Child o' Mine*.  

At least I'm not King Jeremy the Wicked.  That's a good thing, right?  "
"Found this community and I thought of doing some of my own digital entries on here.

Little background of myself.
I’m F(20) and currently live with my parents and two pets. Currently not in school at the moment (taking a break) and working two jobs at my local mall. 
~
I’ve been considering changing jobs at the moment due to some...issues I’ve been having at one of my current jobs. Now I work two jobs, one being a server at some pretzel shop and the second being a key holder at a jewelry/fashion store. I love my second job so much! I have amazing mangers/coworkers and I have so much responsibilities that it makes me excited to come into work every few days a week. However, my first job not so much. At the beginning it was all peachy keen nothing to bad about until I got to know more about the staff working there. Let me break it down: I have an assistant Manager that doesn’t do her job and loves to bully everyone below her including myself, she even threatens us employees about killing us with various of weapons or beating us up if we make her upset (note: I’ve tried to mention this to my other manager and corporate but one of my coworkers/friend advised against it due to it ruining some lives of people who work there), she even gets upset with me and another coworker for becoming good friends and hanging out. I have a manger who also doesn’t know how to do her job either and constantly puts on her problems onto us which causes a lot of stress and problems that most of us can’t handle. I have a few coworkers who keep trying to pick fights with everyone and create this unnecessary drama. It’s just...a very hectic work environment that my best friend keeps trying to tell me to leave. I’ve come to terms this isn’t a place I want to stay for any longer and have started to apply at different locations. However, I have this horrible feeling I might regret this decision if it goes through. You ever feel like that? If you go through with a decision you might regret it and it’ll ruin everything for you? I’ve mention this to my best friend and she’s been comforting me and reassuring that it’s going to be okay at the end and I shouldn’t  worry so much. I’ve made some good memories at that work place (sure some bad ones) but a lot of good memories. And I feel like I won’t have those type of good experiences ever again at a new job. It’s a lot of think about but I have to think fast because who knows if any of those jobs I’ve applied for will call back soon.

"I have still be ruminating about decisions I have made over the first part of the year. Mostly suffering from a bit of FOMO. This is why I am not particularly not too inclined to use social media as much as I have been over the last several years. Life is weird and I tend to over analyze things to an exhausting level. What if scenarios flood my peripheral in a never ending maze of how I could have approached a situation differently. better. This often ends with me tirelessly working on a problem that I have already found a sufficient solution to. then my mind tricks me again and says wait sir. but you could have done this. then I breakdown into what ways that may have been a better solution and so on. FUCK. Lately (this week) I have taken a suggestion I read somewhere in the interwebs and have been labeling when I catch myself ruminating. I simply say ruminating and then slowly try to switch my focus to my breathing. I believe that this has actually helped. Life is already hard enough and to be your own worst enemy only makes it that much more difficult. I have slowly had to teach myself this over the last couple years. That I need not be my own worst enemy, that I need to be my best friend. Love every aspect of myself and in turn then I can truly begin to love the friends and family I have around me. This has been an amazing and long journey but I'm am slowly seeing the benefits of this outlook on life and the attraction of other like minded individuals into my sphere. Love is the key. "
"My sixth post on reddit..

I’m feeling sad again. I was just remembering when we first broke up this time. I listened to a sad song so that was probably my own fault I guess. 

But I’m writing about what my counsellor told me yesterday. She wants me to start dating, well not dating but talking to guys again. She asked me what I was missing in my life and a said somebody. I want to find someone else, I just don’t think I will find someone as good as him again. And I don’t mean good in like a superficial way, I just mean we were pretty much the same and I don’t think I’ll get someone that close of as a match to me again. 

Apparently I’m meant to just talk to guys to find out what I do and don’t like. Just some practice for when I do find someone. I already know what I do and don’t like in somebody though. I’m a bit confused with it all though. My counsellor was pointing out the things she remembers me saying I didn’t like about my ex. She was right, there was some things that did conflict with me. I’m meant to write a list of what I do want in a partner. But my question is where do you draw the line? Yes my ex wasn’t perfect, he had his bad traits along with his good. Am I meant to find somebody who ticks every single box of mine? Do I really not go out with someone if they don’t agree and do everything the same as me? I mean are differences really that bad,is a difference a red flag? My counsellor seemed to think so. I know my opinion on everything, I’ve considered everything, thought about everything. He didn’t do that. He didn’t know what he felt about a lot of things and didn’t have an opinion. She said that was a red flag. I mean it’s different to me, but something to completely say no it’s not going to work? I’m not sure. I like to be honest, I like people being straightforward with me. He kinda preferred to gloss over things and just move on without talking about emotions too much. But aren’t all guys like that? Which guy actually sits down and discusses feelings? She also thought how we resolved arguments wasn’t good. She said him crying whilst me wanting to talk wasn’t good. I didn’t have a problem with him crying, I just felt it meant he cared. 

Things that I thought didn’t matter apparently matter. They don’t bother me though, I never expect anyone to be a perfect human being. I’ve had years of councelling, I know how to handle things. His never been to someone, he didn’t know how to handle things, but I think that’s alright. I don’t think it’s a bad thing. 

We were exactly the same in every other respect. I felt completely comfortable with him within the first hour of meeting him. I’ve never had that happen before, not in relationships or friendships. I’ve never felt that comfortable or at ease. We really clicked. I’ve got an odd personality, most people don’t really understand me, but he was exactly the same. We could predict what each other was going to do and say, we could finish each other’s sentences. I really connected with what he was all about, it was the same as me after all. 

I’m worried I won’t get that again. I liked that, I loved that. I loved everything about him and us. We were that couple that everyone wanted to be. The couple that I had always looked at and thought I wish that was me. His friend once said he wished he had a love like us. Everyone said we were great together and they had never seen him so happy before. He was the perfect yin to my yang. We just went together. 

I want that again. My qualities I want in a guy, pretty much every quality of his. He was perfect to me. I don’t see how I can find someone that unique again. I’m always going to be comparing guys to him, and that’s a tall order for them, in fact I feel sorry for them. 

So I guess I’ll go searching for another him? Probs not what my counsellor anticipated but 🤷🏼‍♀️

"Only an hour later and I’m back. Those good memories turned into something sad. I realised I don’t know him anymore, it’s been months since we talked properly. I’m remembering how it all ended, I remember thinking we were getting back together to him essentially dumping me a second time. I remember how casual he was about it the second time, how I was crying and he was calm. I could hear him typing in the background of the call. He was breaking my heart all over again whilst texting someone else. I wasn’t even worth his full attention in that moment, he had better things to do. His been over me for so long, yet I’m still not really over him. I hate him for that. I hate being the weak one desperate for his love, but I can’t help it. I emailed him again. The thing I wasn’t meant to do, the reason why I started writing on reddit. Emailed, yep. I’ll explain how that ended up happening some time. My only form of contact with him is email, and I’m pretty sure I’d be blocked by now. I wish I could move on like him. This is bad and I know it. I really am just a crazy ex to him now.

"This is a follow up to my second post on reddit, trying to finish the story. 

Well after re-reading my second post, it all sounded ridiculous. Now I can understand why my friends and family were weird about it. Buttttt again I missed out all the details and stories. I think they definitely help in making things make sense. 

In fact, instead of finishing the story, I might fill in some of those gaps. So here’s a whole heap of great memories. 

When we spent our first actual time together, so outside of the plane, Actually there’s a bit before I need to say lol. When he arrived at my place I asked him if he wanted his mattress set up in the lounge or my room. Of course he picked my room. I then just asked if he wanted to sleep in my bed, I said I’d set up a pillow wall and all. He said not to worry about the pillow wall. So he jumps on the bed testing it out. He then decides he will sleep on my side of the bed. Of course I jokingly say nope that’s my side and then it breaks out into a pillow fight. Yep a pillow fight lol. I proceed to try and squish back into my side of the bed, and end up half sitting on him. Finally after trying to move each other and hitting each other with pillows, I win! As we lay there out of breath and laughing, we kiss. Our first kiss, on the first day of him visiting, within the first hour. 

That was a lot longer than I wanted it to be again. I have so many of those memories to write damnnn. Maybe I will write down everything like this. Is it bad that it makes me happy writing about them? I’m still smiling even though it’s been ages, in fact that was almost 2 years ago. I miss him. 

See ya later reddit xx"

"First ever post to Reddit! 

I wish this was a problem easily solved, instead it's one conditioned to make your heart throb, with sadness for the world and the traitors we've each become. Falling prey to others perception is only benefiting this cause. Love isn't permanent to some, allowing as they stomp on and leave our shattered hearts behind. No matter the relation, one sin is to be vindictive to another, seeming to be a path many have chosen. I doubt you'll understand these thoughts, as your close mindedness doesn't quite fit me into your pre-formed mold,  causing me to want to lose myself in the fold. Running away is not the solution, but in my head it's the single choice on my list of  options. I'm ready for this sh*t to end, cut these ties til they are dead. Then maybe I'll be able to be true to myself cause that's who matters the most at the end of this post.
 
For words to come spilling out that's not going to happen. The pain you caused has been too great, good memories are naught as of late. Pushed to the point of not knowing what to do, my feelings aren't going to matter, as long as your precious pride is at stake. Trying to find my place in this world on my own is not how I envisioned my life to be. On opposite sides of the world mentally, in defiance to the rest of you, I've always been the one to battle your rows. My belief in unconditional love was soon set to be twisted. The time for illusions has gone, passing when I started this chapter anew.
 
As I wander aimlessly through the next few years, I'll be reminded by others, of just how well you do. I'm tired of these games and emotional mind f*cks everyone else seems to enjoy. Your voice now tears a hole in my heart that I refuse to stumble through. The growth that I feel is comparable to none, with the exception of the love that I feel for my sons. I won't fall victim to the insecurity she helped you install, implanting troublesome fear inside my mind to be exploited by all. My understanding has never been more clear, my words simple and fears of holding back are naught. I was once center of your world, and suddenly I'm not. I suppose that going through this is going to make me stronger but at times, it makes me question myself in ways you have yet to conquer.  I try to understand how we came to this point, and it makes me curious as to how well meaning you truly are.  Love for your kin should be most natural, apparently only to some until a new love comes along. Changes go unnoticed and unconditional love began to die. That's a part of everyday life currently on the rise. I can't wait to feel peace in my heart, Just to Survive."
"I have been having quite a bit of anxiety the last two days. I'm thinking that I am a bit run down. I have been working out a bit too much I think and my body is run down. I have even been having some trouble staying hard with my gf. I think I will rest the rest of the week to get back on track. Maybe a light workout but nothing more than 20 mins. I was also sick last week. I tend to over do it when I get sick. All last week I worked out even though I was sick and run down. I am running ragged and need to rest. The last two days after having amazing sex all weekend, I was having trouble staying hard and cumming. This only added to my troubles. I will have the next 3 days by myself and I will use them to just chill. lots of meditation and lots of stretching. have to get my levels back in order. I need to completely stop smoking weed for a long time now. my body is telling me that the weed isn't working anymore and is only giving more anxiety. I have still been getting it from all fronts and I am having trouble calming my nerves. Tonight after work I am going to go home and super veg out. Even if I have to meditate for the rest of the evening tonight then that is what I have to do. I have been feeling really out of sorts though. like im almost losing my mind or something. I know this will pass but it has been tuff. I never thought that it would come to this but I'm really struggling today. I have an appointment with my therapist on Thursday morning which I am really looking forward to. I'm not sure an hour is even enough time. Last week I had to quit this project I was really excited about because I kept butting heads with one of the guys I had started it with. My father who is a paranoid schizophrenic also decided it was a good time to direct his psychosis towards me. Now my boss is going off the deep end too. Me, already being run down, is fucking with me.  Luckily I am going out of town with my gf and my parents this weekend and then two weeks after that I am taking a 4 day weekend for my bday/valentines day. I know my gf has my back no matter what but it sucks not being able to cum when we are having sex and she has to give me a hj/bj to get off. There is just so much going on in and around me that I'm feeling overwhelmed at the moment. I know this will pass but right now it is tough. I am going to be completely sober for the next month and then re-evaluate how I feel because right now I'm not really feeling myself. Nothing a lot of deep breathing and meditation can't solve. I'll have an update in a few days. Sending lots of love and compassion out in the world... "
"So i will be just going off top here. This weekend was a bit of a stressful one. Well it was kind of stressful and it was calm at the same time. It had major high stress situations coupled with intense calmness. Today I am feeling a bit more even keeled but first I had a work meeting and the boss kept putting down my suggestions even when the majority of the other group thought what I was saying was very helpful. It has almost been as if he doesn't want to hear what I am trying to say. Like before I even make the comment his mind is made up that it will not be a helpful one and that we should move on. I am an idea type of guy and want my ideas to be greeted with curious as opposed to negative shutdowns. Maybe this is too much of my ego talking as well. still working on killing the ego. I am not necessarily looking at this in the right way. It would be nice if my ideas were met with more openness and less NO but this is not something I can control. I will keep working on developing ways to not let my ego get the best of me. This is life and I need to be better at letting go of negative feedback loops and throwing them away in the trash so to speak. So I had to deal with that stressful situation on saturday morning. and then last night I went home for dinner with my gf and my parents and right after we finished dinner my dad gets up and directs his paranoia towards me. Telling me that I had disrespected him etc. which of course I not done. (he is paranoid schizophrenic). This was the first time my gf of almost 6 months had witnessed his mental illness and this was not easy. and long after the dinner I had trouble going to sleep and was hard for me to shake the negative thoughts. Again, now i have positive tools that help me to deal with things that are out of my control in a much more productive manner, but some days/weekends/months are just better than others and it is harder to get back to a good state of mind. 

&#x200B;

I have to say, my birthday is coming up, a month from yesterday. I as I get older, I am finding that the way I deal with problems that may arise are getting easier and easier. I am learning and I have learned so much in the last few years about who I am, what my triggers are, and how to deal with life and I continue to be so proud of myself. Weekends like this weekend can be tough but sometimes I would ruminate about things for months without been able to shake them. Now at worst it may be a couple days when I get deep into meditation and stretching and those negative thoughts of which I used to attach many negative emotions and feelings are gone. I look forward to continuing on this journey of self exploration and know that there will be many ups and downs but instead of fearing this I and finding comfort in that this challenge or obstacle will be overcome and I will learn so much from every experience. 

&#x200B;

I suppose I used to really dislike myself. I grew up with a father that never had any sort of real love. I am still convinced that he does not understand love or what it means to love. He says the words ""I love you"" so much that to me they had lost meaning. Again, I now know that this is not his fault and I do not blame him for that. His father and mother also did not learn how to love their children and this has been past down to their children. I will break this cycle. I am so happy that I have not had any kids up until this point in my life. Even just a couple years ago I would not have been able to understand this concept but now I know that kids need positive reinforcement. They need to know that they are good at things. They need to hear from their parents that they are amazing at things. Not in a conceded way by any means but in a humble way that keeps them working hard. This a simple concept, but we are so quick to focus on the negative but there is nothing to be gained by looking at things from that angle. We need to always look things in a positive loving way and that's it. positive begets positive. 

&#x200B;

Love, compassion, and positive lights towards myself and everyone in the world. "

Today, I went to the Dr's office to see how the surgery in my left hand was healing. Thankfully, I have made a full recovery. I still have some stiffness, but I got a full release form, which means I can go back to work tomorrow. 

I'm excited to go back to work, even if it's just going to be for a week. (Classes at the university start a week from now, so I will have to either quit or get laid off by then.) It doesn't matter though, I will enjoy attending my classes more than working at this job. (I'm a Pipefitter Helper in case you didn't know.) 

\*Being able to use both hands freely is something that I have been looking forward to for a month, so you can imagine how ecstatic I'm feeling right now. Feel free to share any comments and/or concerns on this post. "
"Those of the Mexican culture are very familiar with this holiday. The day we cut ""La Rosca De Los Reyes"". (Those who don't know what I'm talking about, just search ""La Rosca"" in google to get a better idea.)

Today, me and my family will, along with my aunt, will ""celebrate"" this holiday. We don't put much attention to the traditional reason for the celebration. Instead, this day is more of just getting together, eating some Rosca, and have fun as a family. We tell jokes, tell stories of our past, present, and future, and some of us get tipsy while drinking alcohol. (I never did like the tart taste of alcohol, so I never get drunk. I also found it a bit annoying when someone does get drunk and makes a fool of themselves. It's like taking care of a loud, obnoxious child, but that's my opinion.)

Now, I actually enjoy this holiday, but new years and christmas celebration already kinda filled my need for family gatherings. Don't get me wrong, I like them, but I want to meet new people that are fun and exciting. Because of that, and other reasons, I'm glad this Spring semester in the university is going to start soon.

"So today is the second day of the year. I feel better than I have in starting this year than almost any other year in previous recent memory. that was a fucked up sentence. but I will leave it because i am trying to become a better writer this year and want to see my progression. I would say this is the main reason for me starting a diary on here. I want to become a better writer. life is weird. I have had many ups and downs but i feel like as I enter my 33 year on this earth and soon to be 34th year on this earth, things are getting easier and easier. I am starting to figure this shit out and it feels good. I am understand what works. I am realizing that everything is in my control. The drugs i have put into my body the last 15 years have been we running away from  my problems instead of facing them head on. Now that i look my fears in the face I realize that they aren't so bad. I was able to accomplish my things this last year and am so proud of myself for how far I have come. I have come to understand that positivity begets positivity and that when you completely change your view of the world from a negative to a positive, everything else follows suit. I am really looking forward to taking the things I have learned over the last year and continuing to build on them. I feel like my base is getting close to being complete. I am hoping that after another 6 months of meditation I can begin to explore deeper into my mind. I have definitely learned through my breath that I can control my levels of anxiety and depression. I used to have extreme highs and lows and nowadays I feel much more even keeled. 

&#x200B;

This is also the most excited I have been to start a new year in a long time. As long as i keep building on everything from the last year I know that this will be another to remember. Wishing everyone a very happy New Year with lots of love, compassion, and positive energy. "
"this will be a long rambling post. just wanted to give a disclaimer because i will simply be going off top.

Little background. I am a 33 year old male living in Los Angeles California. This is my home town (rare nowadays, I know). I would like to begin a semi-regular practice of journaling, so i figure what better place to spill my beans than to a bunch of strangers here on reddit.

We are coming to the end of the year and this is always a time in my life to reflect. So that it was I will use this journal entry to do. This has been an amazing year of growth. I am very proud of myself and what I have accomplished. This has not come without many obstacles, but that has made it all the more gratifying. At the end of last year I went through a break up. My first in quite sometime. I did not deal with it initially in the best way. I hid behind a literally marijuana smoke screen for months. I began to feel ill from all the smoking and decided to take a break. This was hard at first but it allowed me the clear head I needed to deal with my emotions and feel. It also allowed me to process the relationship in it's entirety. I spent most of the first part of the year getting into a healthy exercise and meditation routine. I can now honestly say that I am so much more healthy that I have been in the last few years of my life. Right before summer I had a fling with an older lady. She was 10 years older than me. This was an interesting affair. It never really got into a bf/gf relationship but it came very close. She was very good to me. But after a few months and a mini mushroom trip, I realized that i needed to break it off as it was in the end not going to produce the things that I am looking to have in this life. I would like kids and I know that she, after already having 2 kids, did not want any more. Also I wanted to get into a deeper relationship and ultimately with someone I was not only more physically attracted to but more compatible with. I broke off the relationship with her. This was also the first time i can remember in my life that I broke up with someone.

I wrote this top part this morning. Now i am sitting in bed and about to finish up my end of the year reflection. I live mid-city and the helicopter has been circling over my house for the last 30 minutes and I have heard a lot of sirens. shit is going down. anyway.

The last few months to end the year have been difficult. I feel like the first few months i was in cruise control. very little bothered me. I was by myself most the time. I would go to work, workout (usually go for a run), and then eat sleep and repeat. The last few months I dealt with constant change. within the last 5 months of the year I broke up with the older lady. My friend passed away. I got into a new relationship. I broke my ankle. I got a viral infection. my cousin came to visit and stayed at my house for 3 weeks. I started a magazine with some homies and threw 2 big events. One in my backyard. So to say the last few months have been hectic is an understatement.

But through all this the most important thing I have found is meditation. In my past i had always turned to drugs when things got tough. I would smoke, drink, take pills, just find anyway to escape reality. Now i welcome reality with open arms. explore reality. I ask questions about reality. try to examine it from every angle. I am no longer scared. I was letting fear rule my life. now i ask the hard questions. now i face problems head on. Meditation has allowed me the peace of mind to do this. In the last year I have done over 150 hours of meditation. This has changed my life. Anxiety and depression once ruled. Now I am back in control.

Last but certainly not least I have found a beautiful young lady who is amazing. She is the most chill and down to earth young lady I have met. Relationships were always really hard for me and I went through most of my late 20s single because i was too scared to get in one. Too scared to be vulnerable. Now i look vulnerability in the face and laugh. hahahahaha. But her energy has allowed me to feel safe being vulnerable and I am grateful that she has come into my life.

One of the best years of my life and I can't wait to keep growing in 2019."
"It turns out I was deluded.  Deluded with girls.  M.F. was never serious about me.  V. was never serious about me either.  And V.B. on top of not being serious with me started to play with me.

The last days I've been thinking, what was I doing?  Deluding myself with love fantasies, me.  The lonely, the beast, the recluse. 

And this piece of text is a proof of how I want to vomit my sickness unto someone.  \[read from this onward at your own risk\]

Having V. smile for me is a dream-like vision.  But I'm too coward to move.  Paralyzed by fear.  All that remains is my tired, sad face in the mirror.  That man in the mirror.  Who is he?

I dream of having high proficiency in English because I read hard text books but this is looking child-like.  Child-like man.

Throwing stones at my own head won't make me better.  I must leave comfort zone. Put more effort in things. I hope I can do something like that on a near future.  "
"Hey I was hoping this sub was real as I’ve been feeling quite depressed lately and I need a way to breathe. Since this is my first post on here I guess I should start from the beginning.

I’m a 16 yo Male that has just entered post 16 in September 2018. Ever since the beginning of summer break in June I have became very lonely and depressed. I struggle to express my true feelings to others and it is at its worst now.

Over the elongated 9 weeks of summer and from then until now I have had nothing to do and no one to talk to when I am at home. I live with my single mum and I’m an only child. I don’t have a close relationship to my mum or any other family member either so that is out of the window.

In June this year before school ended, we had an end of year prom which I went to with the only person I hang out with at school. While I was there, I found out that a girl I was somewhat friends with: I had a crush on. I didn’t do anything and I found out at the end of the night that she was leaving my school (which I was continuing into sixth form) to go to another college.

That night whilst I was talking to someone else she placed her head on my shoulder. I asked her if she was alright and she said she was “just tired” and eventually removed her head from my shoulder.

Ever since then I can’t stop thinking about that moment and about her. I have talked to her (over snapchat) again since after I found out that she is coming back to my college next year as she is unhappy with her courses. I am excited for her to come back but also unconfident as I don’t know if she likes me back or even cares that much.

I feel creepy and pathetic when I think about her and that situation. It has been half a month and I can’t get over my first crush on someone. I feel delusional and stupid when I think about that moment on prom night because it was probably just a friendly and sleepy gesture. After all she hugs people a lot so it wouldn’t be that out of character.

I only really have three friends who I don’t often do anything with.

One of them does not go to my current school (I knew him from my old secondary school and my primary school until I separated from my old school for y10 onwards) but has attempted to apply twice with no avail. I feel bad for having depression when he has and is suffering so much worse than me by not experiencing the quality of school mine is. As a placeholder, I shall call him Blue from now on.

One of them I have known since the start of my new school in y10. We met because everyone else picked partners in the class and we were the only two left. He is very disciplined and a hard worker. He also has a large family with two respectable siblings and a close mother and father. He has surpassed me in all of my grades apart from those where I also got the top grade. I feel as though our friendship is holding him back from making a lot more friends as he always hangs around just me. As a placeholder, I will call him Yellow.

My third friend I have also known since the start of y10. However I would not have considered him my true friend until sixth form this year as we are now a part of the same BTEC level class and we have grown closer. He is very outgoing and is fairly popular around school. He is friendly and kind to everyone but most of all he is very confident and open. He isn’t that good looking, at least in my opinion, but he has had a lot of girlfriends especially for a complete anime and Nintendo geek like him. He recently started dating another person I know from the school. He’s very supportive and I have opens up to him the most about my depression but there is still a lot I have concealed. As a placeholder, I am going to name him Red.

My lack of friends and social interaction outside of school has made me lonelier and lonelier and I have been using Reddit to the best of my ability to tackle my depression. It comes in waves of sudden, unexpected sadness that have once caused me to cry myself to sleep although I have not cried any other time. I feel inferior to all of my friends and hanging around them no longer makes me happy for more than the time I spend with them; As soon as we stop texting or I am on the bus home and I’m alone again I feel at a loss.

Now to today:

I can’t sleep because for the entirety of today (or I guess Sunday) and part of Saturday I have been thinking about changing courses next year and trying to complete all of my current course in one school year. I have believed for a long time in my life that I want to be a games designer but over the time more recently I have realised my potential of a career in film and tv directing or filming a motion picture.

I think, however, my decision has also been swayed by my crush who also plans to join film and tv next year too. Whilst I see it as just icing on the cake, Red who knows about my crush, suggested that it could be swaying my opinion more than I think.

It is getting to 5:00 AM now and I’m getting fairly tired. I know, though, that if I go to sleep I won’t wake up for hours even with 75+ alarms on. I have to get up for six and really can’t be bothered.

I have yet to tell Yellow or Blue about my depression or my wavering decision to change courses but I plan to tell them at least about my wavering decision next time we meet."
"A ten percent cider, why do I always live with the feeling everyone hates me for my degeneracy? It is hard hitting tonight. They wonder why I like my solitude, or why I like drunks. Drunks are forgiving. 

It is confusing to live in extremes. A man told me yesterday I seemed unreal, a woman fabricated by men for men. It is disgusting and flattering. I love men. 

A pub employee got the courage to talk to me and confessed he’s found me sexy for months. He was alright, a bit irksome after a few too many in him, but decent company. The power cut and the pub went dark, everyone yelled, but then continued in their revelry. In the dark, we talked love and lust and alcoholism. I knew he wanted me. We went out for a cigarette and he walked out with a beer, free. He asked me to come home and I said I would, but I wasn’t going to fuck him. We played records and he drank vodka and I drank whisky and he tripped up the stairs spilling his lot, all while boasting of his tolerance and abilities. He tried a few more times with me and I declined again, and so we did more cocaine and drank more whisky until we passed out asleep. 

And all of this, is because of X. It makes me angry – I can’t even fuck anymore. I’m not the bar’s whore. I will kiss a man, I will go off, blow him, but fucking, *fucking*, I want to fuck X. Will moving make him fuck me? Make him pull me down the street, and shove me inside my apartment? I hope. The business of my making him nervous bothers me. Because I am fatal attraction, Pandora’s box opened, and my persistence will wreck complete havoc? Or because I am fatal attraction, too much, and he knows he will ruin it and succumb? After he confessed all this to the other man we made the first eye contact of the night. I had been a brat and ignoring him out of spite. We locked eyes and he smirked, sauntered over, and shoved me further into my booth, wrapping his arm around me. I am a halfway decent judge of character and intention, but I am in the dark. Heavy petting later, he left and I asked him back, but he told me he shouldn’t. He walked up to the bar and sat down and I followed him and told him again about the fuck. I wanted anything really, he could slap me and I’d feel the sex. He told me again he wanted to, he couldn’t – ‘*if* I was single, ‘*when* I am single’. Excuses, when so far gone already? 

Everyone lied about sex.

"Friday was a pretty crazy day.  I'm in the process of negotiating a contract and have been playing phone tag with the other party.  There have been a few contentious issues but eventually I think it will all work out to everyone's satisfaction.  So anyway, yesterday me, my boss, (not Porsche Boss) and a new co-worker had a business meeting outside the office all morning with a lender.  The funny thing is, the meeting was across the street from the office with my former employer, so I knew the two people we were meeting with.  It was a great meeting and they took us out to lunch at one of my favorite restaurants (within walking distance).

&#x200B;

We get back after lunch and I finally get the other party on the line.  They gave in on everything but two issues, and frankly, I can't blame them.  I would not have given in on those issues either.  At 3:15 PM I get an email from the Vice President requesting my presence at another meeting...oh and this meeting started at 3:00.  YIKES!  This meeting was with a lender who wants to sell us a much of loans. that breaks up at about 5:00 and I go back to get some work done on this negotiation.

&#x200B;

At around 6:00 I decided I had enough and packed up to go home.  I am waiting at the elevator bank with my briefcase excited that I will actually get home before 7:00 when two co-workers from another dept walk out.  They are going to grab a drink and I should come along they say.  Well, there goes dinner! We walk across the street to the bar and they ordered the house wine.  I had a Southern Comfort and orange juice.

&#x200B;

Cathy of them tells me a couple of interesting tidbits.  First, Sheila has been promoted to Director.  WHAT?? Did I hear that right?  What the fuck?  Really?  I have been trying to get Director for a year now and SHE just got promoted?  I know more than she does and have been here a lot longer!  Sheila is a lovely woman who deserves the promotion, but hell, so do I!!  Cathy felt the same way about it.  We are both happy for Sheila, but feel really pissed that we all do the same level of work and don't seem to get recognized for it.  It just seems that the company hands out these promotions randomly.  I have seen so many people not any better than me (some worse) get promoted that it just really makes me sick.  Also, it seems that the people on the ""front end"" of the business get all the promotions and glory while folks on the ""back end"" do most of the work.  Oh well, right now I am locked in my job, but I am going to start looking for opportunities within the company in October.  Until then, I am just waiting my turn.

&#x200B;

So, the other thing that Cathy said was that the word on the street is that not a lot of people think very highly of Bruce as a manager.  This came as a surprise to me.  I really like Bruce a lot and we get along very well together.  I'd go o far as to say that we were friends. But I have expressed my frustration about him not being able to provide direction or make a decision.  It appears that others see that too and not just me.  This is a good bit of info to keep in the back of my head.

&#x200B;

I'll be in Dallas for a week and Cathy is going to meet me one day for a meeting and dinner with a lender.  We decided to have drinks and I'm going to pump her for more information about all this.

&#x200B;

I was so pissed off about the who Sheila thing that I woke up at 5:00 fucking AM.  I am SOOOO not a morning person!"
"Hi,

Recently, I got an exciting / fun opportunity to move out of state for a program.

However, also recently, I have been experiencing a lot of back pain. It was getting considerably better,  but it suddenly went the opposite way and got worse.

I have serious reservations that I can do the program, as it requires long hours and weeks and manual labor.

I feel a little down. I don’t know what I am going to do in general. I struggle with direction and independence. I left my job for this program, but I feel I should have left it earlier for my back, since it also included physical labor.

I think this is a push for me to take care of my body and strengthen it up. I’m scared about the injury and what limitations I should be aware of for the future. I’m scared too because I don’t know what I want for my life in terms of making income. I am in my late 20s, nearing 30. I’m scared of not finding something that gives me enough purpose/fulfillment. But I want good health insurance. I want to be able to live on my own.

I want my body to be stronger because there is a lot of physical activity that I want to do in my life, like dance and doing outdoor travel activity.

I think the big fear is that my life won’t change ever, but I know that won’t happen. I just have to keep trucking along and find another way. 


Thanks~~ for listening

UPDATE: Hi, it’s November and things are looking up. Was pretty stressed around the time I posted this. I’m feeling better, and plans are sticking - so far!"
Heyyy fam im drunk as fuck and idfaf give a fuck boiok lmao hahahahdkhabsj
"As I stand here in this moment, I stand at a cross roads. 

To the left, I can go on with life as I have known it. To the right, I could make some choices to create a new life and experiences. 

I know that God (for lack of a better word) provided me with these new insight as well as experiences (both wonderful and challenging) to show me that I do have a choice. Before I was living on auto pilot, going with the flow of life long conditioned behaviours...living in the passenger seat. I know now I do not have to live that way, the next step is to figure out what it is I want.

The last few days since my husband went out of town and my daughter was with her dad...have been the first few days in many years that I have been able to introspect and really begin looking at what I have been experiencing, what pain I have caused others, and how to be a better person.

It's not easy, but..it's somewhat refreshing"
"I’ve been having so much fun I totally forgot to vent here yesterday. What is this? Progress? Lol 

Today is Happier by Marshmello and Bastille on repeat. We all know who I’m dedicating it to at this point. 

K wants to keep K another week. It breaks my heart.  He just doesn’t want M to think we have anything going on.  He blames it on his Mother.  He fools everyone but me.  Like she woke him up at 6am to yell about my tweets for no reason.  

He’s such a coward. It’s such a turn off.  He can’t stand up to his family at all. I could never respect him as a man or my partner. Who wants that? If you can’t be honest with your family how can you stand up for me and our family? Lol. FOH. 

He doesn’t want to come up two weekends in a row. No matter what it always comes back to what HE wants and what will make HIM feel comfortable. Prick. 

I’m watching the travelers now. It’s interesting but has a bunch of twists. Making me focus. 

E took me for a 90 minute massage today. :) had hot Cheeto popcorn waiting for me. He drove all the way here for that. And got me sushi. It’s so different. And amazing. I have a date with someone else next weekend.  Let’s see how it goes. So many options. I haven’t allowed this to happen in a long time. Maybe I’ll actually shag someone else besides K. :/ 

D played sick at school today so they would call me to come get him. I had his gma go get him. He’s acting strange the past few weeks, he did this last Friday.  

“Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends....”"
"I used to sit and think about K all day. It’s a stark contrast to now. He rarely crosses my mind even. I deleted all the photos and messages from and concerning him. We didn’t have ANY together. After 15 years not one. But that’s how he works. He takes them with everyone else. I should have came to my senses sooner. 

E is freaking amazing. Still. It’s so easy. T told me she thinks he’s the person that will change my mind about marriage. I don’t WANT my mind changed so there’s that. Lol. 

Got my oil changed today it was so low there was nothing fr them to drain out. I know better than that. I shouldn’t treat my car like that, she’s been so good to me.  The first one like this actually. 

I miss baby K. But it’s time he has time to bond completely with his father beautiful little family. 

I missed feeling this wonderful. This loved this appreciated. I can’t get over it. I’ve never had anyone just looking out for me just because they care. Not because they’re manipulating me or want  something from me. I’ve been waiting for this. "
"The compliments, the flattery the thoughtfulness, I am never going to let go of this. I’ve missed this feeling like an ache in my bones. To feel, important again to someone. 

We started watching the dragon prince, it reminds me of avatar so much. I googled it and apparently I’m not the only person who thinks so. Lol.  All I’ve done is eat all day long today. I’m not the least bit guilty. 

Read my cards today for the first time in a while. I just don’t like homing into my own energy. Plus my deck has a mind of its own lately and refuses to give me anything but love readings. I never do a love reading for myself. It’s never been a priority. 

It never will be. No one can shake me. I actually didn’t finish Quantico. It was way tooooo long. And too much. I hate that. I’m cooking again. But I want something chocolate. I don’t even like chocolate. 

We miss baby K. I’ve honestly raised K to be a very well adjusted and friendly baby. I don’t very the credit I deserve. Which, I’m not doing it for credit. It’s the right thing to do. Out of both children they are both the most well adjusted ones. And they will stay that way. 

I still haven’t volunteered this week.  I will though. I really want to get a pet on that note. But I can’t have them here. Maybe one day. I still haven’t bought that ring for myself. But I’m starting to think I won’t have to.

"Dear Reader,

I'm struggling again. I hate to only come here when things are really bad, but that seems to be the only time that I feel like talking haha. I'm living in my own apartment with my girlfriend. She isn't working because she's been so sick from her chronic lyme disease, plus she has a sinus infection at the moment. I've been doing my best to take care of her while working two jobs. Although, I feel so useless because my jobs aren't giving me enough hours to be able to pay the rent and get food. It's like every time I get ahead, I fall ten steps back.

Like, we moved up here, and were living with her mom at first. She ended up getting this savings bond thing cashed in that her grandparents put in the bank for her when she was born. So we used that to get a used car and our first apartment. Then we got food and by the end of the month it was pretty much gone,. It wasn't that much to begin with, but it was enough to get us on our feet again after being homeless for the past year plus.

So, after we got established, come to find out that my driver's license is suspended because I didn't have my doctor fill out a medical examination form (I hadn't established a new primary care doctor yet). I found this out by getting pulled over for something stupid, and the police officer comes back and tells me that I'm under suspension. I end up with a court summons, and I have to call someone to drive me and my car home.

After that, I still had to get to work, so I kept driving like an idiot, and I get pulled over again for being ""all over the road"", which I was not, I think they were just trying to find a reason. I get another court summons. Have to get taken home again. UGH. Then, I accidentally miss my court date because I thought it was the day after it actually was. So now at this point, there's a warrant out for my arrest for missing court. Great. I scrounge up money from my grandmother to pay for bail, and I turn myself in. Then, I pay bail and get out. It was maybe 20 minutes I was in custody. The officers were very nice this time, and understanding.

So fast forward to the day before yesterday. I decide to drive to bring myself to the hospital because I got a second degree burn from the stove. And what happens the one time I decide to drive? I get pulled over. They run my name and see that I'm violating bail conditions, and they put me in cuffs. I had a major panic attack, cause I didn't even know I had bail conditions. Ugh.

I tell the officer that I needed to go to the hospital, and she takes me, while I'm in custody. While I'm there and having a panic attack, she apparently decided to take pity on me and not take me to the jail that is an hour away from where I live. So, I end up getting two more summons, but I did get the medical treatment I needed, so that's good..

Ugh, I just wish I could support myself and my girlfriend better. It's like I work two jobs, but it doesn't even matter because everything is so expensive.

Blah. Well, good night, Reader.

Thanks for reading.

\- R"
"Had to switch to my throw away. Makes me feel safer. 

K came to see K today. I’m scared K isn’t getting enough time with him. He wasn’t underneath him like he has been lately. I would let him go visit but honestly I can’t stomach him going down there. After the situation M let  J & D be in just so she could hear some arguing. I could can’t imagine what could happen with K. 

If that’s what you do to someone’s kid who your supposed to love. Imagine the kid of someone she doesn’t like for whatever reason. I wish K had said something about that to her but whatever. Their life. 

I didn’t go to court, of course.  I’m glad K didn’t want to talk about what happened  last week really. What am I supposed to hear? More stuff that makes me sad? I just hate the lies. Not the actions.  Told him about that email.  I forgot about it. Even though it was like a crime stoppers tip. Lol. 

I think he had a small moment of honesty with me on the way to the airport.  I say THINK because he’s always lying.  

Can’t wait for therapy again. I did do my assignment for the week.  Baby steps.  Becoming a effectively functioning adult is important to me.  My kids need that. While everyone else I know goes in these useless circles and hides and fool themselves, I’ll am really changing.  

Very tired. My body is spent.  I love this feeling.  

Wonder if I should get my hair done? I love it now. But I’m getting that itch to shave it now. 

Still no carrot cake. What’s a lady have to do around here? "
"I'm a Patreon supporter of /r/LPOTL and they just did a special bonus interview with Caitlin Doughty of Ask A Mortician. I love her and got her book, *Smoke Gets In Your Eyes*, right when it came out. I was happy to hear that she now has her own funeral home. She advised that everyone should start thinking about and preparing for their own death ""now"" which is good advice. They were mostly talking about what happens to dead bodies, but that's at the bottom of my list of concerns. I have preferences, I definitely do not want to be embalmed or put in one of those awful lead-lined caskets or a concrete vault. Cremation would be OK but I'd prefer to decompose naturally. Still, ultimately I'm not going to be conscious in there and it's the least important aspect to me. 

&#x200B;

The big thing is making sure that my spouse has access to my money and important accounts. I have my checking account, an investment account, a 401k and life insurance. I also am the account holder on a lot of things from our Netflix account to the car insurance. 

&#x200B;

I'd also like to make sure that my creative work doesn't get lost forever, and that stupid/embarrassing personal shit does get lost. That's something I need to work on myself, getting things deleted and filed and sorted correctly, and then collect passwords and put them somewhere my spouse can find them. Being organized is the big thing.

&#x200B;

There's also the aspect of leaving a message to my son so he has something from me other than vague memories. I'm not sure how to do that but it's worth thinking about. 

&#x200B;

To be clear, I'm not planning to die any time soon. I sincerely hope I live to be 100. Maybe even live to see the 22nd century-- it's highly unlikely, but possible. (I'd be 112) But you never know and I want to make sure I don't leave total chaos when I go, if I go any time soon. "
"It's September 11 and the only reason that pops into my mind right this second is that a friend of mine made a memorial post on Facebook and it was the first thing in my feed this morning. So much has happened in the last couple of years that it feels muted, it's no longer the worst thing in recent memory. 

Been reading *This is Real and You Are Completely Unprepared* by Alan Lew. It's really good and I don't normally like books like that; usually I only read fiction, or nonfiction books that are very factually informative. This books is a guide and a meditation on the High Holy Days and it really has made a difference in how I've experienced Elul and Rosh Hashana this year.

Things are chaotic. When are they not? 

I'm worried about the situation with Hispanic Americans getting their passports taken away and their citizenship called into question. I'm also worried about my own passport, which I'm having some issues with, but it's nowhere near the severity because it's not my citizenship that's being threatened, just my ability to leave the country. 

The worst thing is the kids in these baby jails. I don't even know what to say about that. The situation speaks for itself. I've donated to RAICES and other immigration-specific organizations.  Another place I support just got a huge grant to help with immigration legal cases. My local representative works on immigration issues-- I called his office yesterday. It's still happening. I have no relevant skills, just money, and all I can do is give it to people who can help. 

Work is a little frustrating at the moment because my current task is to get information and the one person who is most likely to have that information is not responding to me. At the same time I kind of appreciate these twiddle-my-thumbs times because it's a good opportunity from a brain dump which I desperately need. I meant to do this yesterday but I was so exhausted when I got home that all I could do was sit and binge-watch *Making It* and then did end up working on a personal coding project for hours after kid went to bed which was possibly a mistake and frustrating but at the same time I made a little progress and after all isn't that this ""professional development"" thing they're always talking about? My big challenge is to force myself to try and figure things out instead of looking at workarounds or ""well, it works"" or ""oh that's good enough"". Of course I could do it the easy and ugly way, that's not the point. 

Rosh Hashana morning service yesterday was beautiful. Didn't stay for the evening service as I'd planned to which was just as well, kid was starting to come down with a cold. He's home sick today. Did I mention the car? No of course, I haven't. We don't have a driveable car at the moment because a tree branch fell on it and smashed the windshield. We took the bus to the train yesterday and I will be able to take him on the bus to daycare tomorrow if he's feeling better, which I've never done before and always thought of no car== no daycare which I don't know why I hadn't figured this out before. 

Service was beautiful and then had brunch with a few people at a board member's condo and my kid ran around with the rabbi's kids and she (the rabbi) reminded me to sign up for[PJ Library](https://pjlibrary.org/home) which kid's speech therapist had also recommended. Free Jewish books for kids! Very cool. 

One of my friends from shul is going through a traumatic breakup. Other friends struggling financially and trying to move and I'm trying to help them. 

Need to remember I'm going to visit my sister at the end of the month. My friend is coming with me so I'm not going to be traveling alone with kiddo which is good. 

Excited about Inktober and NaNoWriMo. I've realized that the way to really enjoy NaNoWriMo is to let go of the idea of ending up with a publishable novel, even the one I continued on last year and expanded and revised and ended up with a readable \~80k-word manuscript isn't \*finished\* and I don't know that it ever will be... but just to end up with \*something\* because what I did do is rewrite the novel as a play that, I think, does work. Just thinking of it as an idea garden. Maybe do another one-man show. 

Bad habit: half-finishing things or finishing and then abandoning them. I need to take another pass at the play I wrote that my friend read and had advice on. The short-stories I wrote? It doesn't seem like submitting short stories isn't super viable anymore, I looked and looked and most publications I found aren't even accepting submissions, I only found a couple places to send. It feels a bit pointless. 

Need to get to reading the poems my pen pal sent. He sent me a big fat envelope with 17 poems (he told me in another letter) and the task feels daunting so I haven't started. Need to.

By the end of September I want to get this game/comic thing up online, at least the first ""chapter"". Also want to take that other stab at the play so I can put it to bed by submitting it to some companies. I've decided to stop courting the theatre company I've been trying to work with. It's not a good fit, I just did a baby-bird/mama-bird on them because they were the first company I'd seen a play with in years and they're so good. But their aesthetic and mission just doesn't fit with the kinds of stories I tell. (Have I said this before? Deja vu.) 

Looking forward to Yom Kippur. I know it sounds weird but it's actually my favorite holiday, it's a time to embrace the suck and rehearse for your death. Holidays usually stress me out because of the pressure to make it wonderful and special, and so a holiday where you're doing it right if you're hungry and thirsty and caffeine-deprived and stinking and miserable is refreshing. And the sermon for Yom Kippur last year was one of the best and most powerful I've ever heard. Also we do a big drive for the women's shelter at the church that hosts us. I need to remember to get stuff for that.

Also have some art projects to undertake, I'm going to be making a few things for my lodge and I'm excited they're letting me do that. Need to get to Michael's. 

I really need to get paid. Four days, theoretically. That's another source of stress, been almost 6 weeks without getting paid and running down on funds and even though I know it's going to be fine I've gotten used to having a lot of padding. 

Insurance inspector is coming out to look at the car, glad that's happening now. 

&#x200B;

Need to do laundry and dishes on top of everything. 

... 

The inspector just came out, was very nice and efficient, and waived the deductible so I won't need to pay hundreds of dollars on this. Whew! Also hopefully should be able to get a glass person to come out and fix the windshield soon and the rest shouldn't take long, fingers crossed. At least it'll be drivable with the windshield fixed. 

...

Just had like a fifteen-minute conversation with the lady on the phone for SafeLight about our families and parenting and she told me all about her family. She was nice. Also the lady on the phone for insurance just now thought I was my husband, that made me really happy.

...

There was no official taschlich yesterday with our synagogue so I walked down to the water with kiddo and we threw breadcrumbs in. This was what spouse and I did our first Rosh Hashana as a family, because we tried to meet up with this other synagogue for their taschlich service and couldn't find them in the park. I'm not sure our breadcrumbs made it into the water because we didn't get too close, the bank was really steep and slippery and the water was moving fast and kiddo was scared (with good reason) of falling in if we got too close to the edge and slipped. It was an exercise in letting go-- yes I think that breadcrumb actually hit some foliage and didn't go into the water, that's OK.

"My phone did a dumb and so I'm retyping all of this *sigh*

Today was middling, my dreams continue to exhaust me but I their intensity and vividness will work for my work to learn how to lucid dream I think.

The thing that really stopped today from being good though was it was supposed to be the day I had some money but because my flatmates can't go a day without using their space heater I had to pay all the money I had left over after rent into the power bill. I think the $170 they need to pay scared them a bit though so hopefully they'll actually stop using it and just put warmer clothes on for a change it not actually use it on days where it's warm and I can have this layer of anxiety off of me (I've brought it up so many times, it's frustrating it got this far before they registered it and only because it's now impacting them, not just me)

Good stuff did happen though, found my old external, it has my writing ideas and some design ideas for video games I haven't seen in like five years and combined with an old laptop I managed to bash into working with a bit of on the fly repair work I've started playing WoW which isn't entirely my jam but it's something to keep me going till I can scrape the funds together to get the big boy going and I can start doing music again.

I also made a post to r/non-binary with my face and admitting more openly than I ever have that I'm a demiboy, I was super anxious because I just look quite masculine and was scared I would be welcome and also scared of the hate I usually get for being open about this stuff which sucks, no one cares about my polyamory or kink stuff but gender and sexuality gets me attacked so much.

But it was okay, the people of the sub itself have said so many nice things and I feel okay to be me and I only received a couple of messages telling me to kill myself in my DM's, much less than usual so that's worth celebrating I feel.

It's nice to have told people in a more public space, so far I'd only told two of my partners and one very close friend so this is good practice for my broader circles of people.

I am worried about one of my partners, she's having what sounds to me like a dissociative episode and neither her nor I know how to help and my other partner is having some flare ups of dysmorphia and drive to self harm, I gotta remember to check in and keep supporting them, I hope I can see them both soon 

I am also a bit anxious cause I move to 75mg of my medication tomorrow, I'm worried about being more tired, I'm worried that something will queue my PTSD dreams while I'm doing this and the vividness and intensity will be too much, this is why I need to lucid dream, so I can control it, I have to keep trying...

I'm also running out of the mushroom pills for my migraines and I haven't got an avenue for more at the moment, I can't go back to that debilitating pain but I don't think I have a choice.

I still don't really know how to end these, I guess it's like every day at the moment, I gotta keep trying and hopefully get a little better each time regardless of how bad or good it went last time.

Future me, if you're reading this, let me know if you figure it out, thanks."
"After Europe, I finally told my mom about my long distance boyfriend(call him B). She was actually happy for me, and said if we meet, he had to come here first. We made plans and he came up that summer. I was nervous but we quickly became comfortable with each others presence. On the drive home from the airport, I hit a deer. So humiliating. Lol. That visit was basically a teen movie: we went for walks, visited places, watched a meteor shower. Our relationship lasted 4ish years. When I finally graduated, I was a very different person from the little girl who hid. I was the most colorful girl there, blue + purple hair, multicolored dress(if requsted ill tell my grad dress story). That day, I glowed. I didnt go to the dinner or party, I went home with a bunch of family and had a little potluck. After I graduated I worked and visited B, I was planning to move countries for him. Before that, I decided I should go get a degree in childcare(kids are awesome). This caused some strain, as he became more desperate for me to be there, but I didnt understand why he fought so hard against it. My mom finally found someone and fell in love, moving in with him that summer. My first semester, B cheated on me. I was devastated, but I forgave him, because after years of work its hard to walk away. 1"
"You know, how I pride myself on being honest.  Yet, it’s taken me this long to see. That I’m a fraud. But at least a here on this forum I can be honest and I’ll never have to send it. 

I’m not sure why I do this. There’s a person that loves you. She loves you enough to torment me. To write me. To destroy any life our son could have had. That’s how strong she wants you. 

And here’s me, I only half heartedly fight for you, I have no wish to move to be with you, to see you more, and when we were together I didn’t come after you. 

So if I don’t truly want you, why won’t I let someone else have you? Am I just as bad of a person as you are? And if I don’t want you then why are your arms the only place I want to be right now? But why when I imagine my future, you’re never in it? And when you were able to love me, why wouldn’t I accept it? 

How can I feel two equal and opposite things  at the same exact time? Doesn’t that go against the laws of physics or some shit? 

And it’s only getting worse. The harder you become towards me the more the light in me that wants to shine for you cowers even deeper inside.  And if I don’t care then why am I so saddened that the flame has burned its last breath? Your Mother even told you, you couldn’t tame me. I think you may believe that. 

I’m so sorry for the pain that I’ve caused. I don’t like hurting others no matter how deserving they are of it. When the pain became too much, I wanted to run from this life. But, I am not the type to run. 

I love you the best way I know how. But it’s a selfish terrible excruciating love. I’m really working on being able to let someone who really loves you to peacefully have you. 

You love guarantees.  And it’s a guarantee that she will always take you back as long as you pretend to work at it. I’ll never be that easy. I wish I was, everyday, because it would make things so much easier. 

But I can only be me.  I’m too strong, and too tough, and it’s too impossible for you to ever do anything to make me love you. I’m your Everest. 

I’m everyone’s Everest. I’ll sit here, majestic and untouched unless it’s someone truly worthy.  "
"I get a lot of migraines now, I've always got them but they have gotten more frequent and severe recently, my doctor can't figure out why, we'd say it's my eyes but my vision is still the sub par level it's always been and I'm more careful about wearing my glasses than I used to be so *shrug*

I've been given a lot of things for it, we tried tramadol, I like tramadol, it makes me fuzzy inside and I like cuddling the dog while I'm on it but it doesn't fix the migraines.

Codiene was next, I don't like codiene, it tastes gross and I just fall asleep and wake up with my head still pounding and I feel ill on top of it.

Panadiene was less severe on my stomach but I still just fall asleep and wake up still with my head raging.

I had some dissolvable one for a while, voltaren I think? That dulled it but never got rid of it, I'd still have to lay in a dark room and pray I could sleep, that stuff was better at dealing with my tooth when I had an infection and the gum was swollen.

We're hoping that maybe some of the mood stabilizers I'm being trialed on will help but so far it's not hopeful.

But then there's the thing that makes me a criminal.
I had heard that psychedelics can get rid of migraines when they're happening, a friend referenced lsd specifically and while I enjoy lsd I didn't want to spend the huge amounts of money it costs to get a tab here to then trip for 10 hours or so just to get rid of one migraine, too much money and time commitment.

But mushrooms, magic mushrooms, those babies could be the go right? No one had mentioned they had the same effect but I thought why the hell not, I manage to get a decent amount around the time anyway and had even made them into easy to swallow pills so what did I have to lose? One bad trip? It's only ever about four hours anyway.

So I waited, I waited till the inevitable familiar pain started (always behind the left eye first) and I let it get worse so I could be sure it was a migraine and at it's peak, I popped a couple of the pills and then...nothing and I mean nothing happened for several hours, I felt defeated , still in pain, bad mushrooms and a wasted day alone. My flatmates came home, I was on the couch and they new the signs so they kept quiet around me (they are good people) hours passed, head still raging untill suddenly I felt tingly and like this veil being lifted the pain was gone and I realized I didn't factor in that the veggie capsules the mushrooms were in took a while to break down and that I was now both tripping and in possession of the only thing that fixed my migraines.

That night was great from there (for obvious reasons) and I did some trials with later ones found 1g does me good, deals with the migraine, give me a nice confidence boost for four hours and I am super productive, I discover that they are actually a controlled hypomanic state for me, I process and deal with a lot of stuff, have a large amount of self realizations and then gently come down and feel at peace and relaxed.

And for that I'm a criminal, they're a class A drug, if someone found the ones I usually have on me for an emergency I could get a MASSIVE fine and/or jail time.

And if that isn't just a perfect fucking metaphor for my life I don't know what is."
"I thought about him all day long. But I managed not to cry. Maybe 'cause I was sick and on cold meds. I dunno. I'm having trouble sleeping. I haven't had this kind of trouble sleeping in ages. My body is tired, but my mind won't shut off. I miss him so much.

I asked him to think about whether he actually wanted to leave me for at least a day. The day came and went. I never talked with him about it. Before he could come to me and say anything, I asked if he would think about it longer. He was still saying he didn't know. He said he was trying to be okay.

I've never seen him cry that hard before. I've never seen him truly cry sober. I saw it a couple of times when we were drinking while he was mourning his friend. When we broke up, tears were everhwhere. His face was soaked. He looked like he was in so much pain.

The night before he had reassured me over and over that he loved me so much and didn't want to leave me. I don't know what changed his mind. Maybe it was just when he went home to think. Maybe it was in the morning, when he called me before coming over. I called him to make sure he was up for work (I do this as a courtesy, not because he depends on it), but I remembered he said he was going to go in earlier. I thought he was late. I asked about his schedule, and I guess I sounded panicked or something (due to his lateness) and he snapped at me. That was the first time he'd ever snapped at me. I was taken aback. I hung up on him. That was the first time I'd ever done that. I didn't text him after. I was mad. I got in the shower. When I got out, I had 5 missed calls and he had texted me 3 times. He apologized for being snappy. I apologized for hanging up on him. He was outside waiting for me (we live within a very short walking distance of one another, so this isn't weird).

I hugged him tight. He hugged me back. I went and did my makeup. He talked to me while I did. I brought up how, if he ever wanted to breakup with me he shouldn't feel trapped just because he loved me. That sometimes when people love each other, a relationship still doesn't work. That it takes more than just love. I don't know why I said it. I guess I had a feeling. We had a pretty heavy talk the night before. I wouldn't call it a fight, but it was stuff had been bugging him. We never really fought.

I don't know if my words made him do it. I want him to do what's best for him. But I don't necessarily think breaking up is best. We're great together. We're not just in love, we make a great team. We work well together. We respect each other. We communicate instead of fight. We love spending time together. We love laughing. We love touching.

He said he needs to do some soul searching because he's not sure what he wants. He's in a weird transitional period of his life, so I understand. I guess he needs to figure out whether he wants to continue into the next stage of his life with me or not.  

He just texted me to see how my day went (!!) and interrupted my stream of consciousness. Hm.   


Edit: I heard this song at work. It really, really made me wanna cry. I don't listen to country, so this was new to me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhTulKznx_Y  "
"I want someone who knows what they want, now. Who can tell me their dreams so that I can help them achieve them, and have them do the same with me. We would never lie to one another, ever. A true partner. Do people like this exist?"
"I day dream. When I clean, when I’m in a car, when I’m in bed. I know when to snap back into reality. Except sometimes I don’t know, or maybe, I don’t want to. That happens when my day dreams involve you. It’s a movie playing in my head, it’s an IMAX movie projected right in-front of my eyes. Front row and best seat to the best day dream. Why would I ignore that?. So I don’t. I enjoy, I smile and I miss, you. 

These day dreams make my day brighter. Except, sometimes I fall for their tricks, or maybe, I let myself fall for them. It’s a fight between dream and reality. What won’t happen and what might happen. I fall for them. I prepare myself for the inevitable, disappointment. Disappointment from me to me. I can stop it, but I don’t. I admire the two of us in my day dreams. I admire it so much that I secretly prepare myself for those things to happen. I secretly prepare as if I’ll ever see you again. 

What’s so bad about that?. I know what I’m getting myself into. I also prepare to let myself down. But it’s no big deal. I’ll be happy I was that close to living that one day dream, with you. That’s enough. "
"It's day 2 without food. All the other days I've just been eating very little. Everytime I get up, I feel like I'm going to stumble and fall. My head hurts more often. I'm constantly feeling like I'm going to faint.

Truth is, I dont have motivation to eat. This mental Illness is fucking me up. I just wanna be at peace. Eat right, be happy for once.

It's so fucking hard. All I wanna do is lay down all day and cry. 

Help.."
"So I've been somewhat frustrated with my growth and my very fit friend gave me some advice. I showed him the routine I'd been doing and he pointed out that I was working the same muscle groups on subsequent days, and so I wasn't resting them properly. I reworked my routine into a better split and ran it by him.

Here's what I'm doing now, everything on lift days five sets: 

**MONDAY**
* pull-ups (5 reps)
* dips (5 reps)
* squats (5 reps)
* front raise (10 reps)
* lateral raise (10 reps)
* hammer curls (10 reps)
* arnold presses (5 reps)


**TUESDAY**
* some form of cardio 
* crunches (3 sets/15 reps)
* reverse crunches (3 sets/15 reps)
* V-ups (3 sets/15 reps) 


**WEDNESDAY** (everything 5 reps)
* standing barbell calf raise
* barbell squat
* stiff-legged barbell deadlift
* barbell lunge


**THURSDAY**
* some form of cardio 
* crunches (3 sets/15 reps)
* reverse crunches (3 sets/15 reps)
* V-ups (3 sets/15 reps) 


**FRIDAY**
* close-grip bench press (5 reps)
* incline bench press (5 reps)
* barbell rear delt rows (5 reps)
* dumbbell upright rows (10 reps)
* dumbbell lateral raises (10 reps) 

Did the Monday workout today and feel like I pushed myself. I was using 25lb weights for the last couple sets of Arnold presses and on the last rep I got stuck halfway and had to really push to finish, but I did it. Everything hurt for a little bit. "
"I don’t know why I feel lonely, I’ll always have me so, I’ll never really be alone...yet, somehow I just can’t help but find me here, walking outside, by myself at 3:00 am.  Hoping for a chance encounter with a fellow wanderer, someone who I can instantly connect with. There’s only one reason you’d be out right now and I’d love to find you and share this with you... 

...even if I am just writing to me in the end...
Currently, I’m trying to not think of how bothered I am, I’m trying to train my emotions to follow suit with my logical reasoning. It keeps straying back to this messy tangle of feelings that I’m having a hard time picking apart. I get it, I understand people and want them to be free to live this one and only life that is certain. To do everything they want to do in this short time playing life. I want each and every opportunity that life has to offer to be seized. Logically, I got this... emotionally, I’m so bothered and hurt that I can’t lay still at 3:00 am. 
Yes, I am bothered and jealous. Yes, I am hurt that we are partners but not friends, like your other friends.. I wish we could do crazy and fun things together and have a million things to talk about and share. AND SHARE... 
it’s not that I’m so much lonely, it’s more like I’m desperately lacking someone to share back with me, to just be real and share... 
... that’s the difference between being lonely and just alone, while by myself alone, listening to tool and walking at 3:31am 

"
"Tired, always tired, behind on everything.
Took the day off work and really glad I did, would have gone completely insane otherwise, but as it is still feeling incredibly behind on everything and exhausted.
I cannot seem to get or stay caught up on *Infinite Jest.* The damn thing is almost 600,000 words. It's not that I'm not enjoying it, but the prospect of trying to finish it in the next few weeks is daunting. I need to get better at reading fast. I've always been a big reader but always read every single word as though reading out loud, and of course that takes forever. I know there's a more efficient way and I can do it for a page or two but it's tiring. 

Got to watch fireworks with the kid, so mission accomplished. He enjoyed them as much as last year.

Went to my BFF's cookout for a little bit, and my bro showed up too so that was a nice surprise. Her friend from way back was there and he was nice but pretty clueless and just told me to my face that he'd guessed I was trans, and was surprised that I was not happy about being clocked. We ended up having a productive conversation and he meant well, but that was really a blow. 

Binge-watched season 2 of GLOW today while drawing and working on the decoupage for the coffee table. I have all the pieces cut out now. 

Still need to write a little, a couple different things actually, and tackle that goddamn tome before falling asleep. I'm so tired. 10pm these days I'm falling asleep. Having some coffee and an apple, hope that will give me enough energy to stay up for a bit. "
"I'm so glad that I made myself learn to change a tire. It felt silly just going out and taking the tire off my car and putting it back on, but now I know how and it actually came in handy! My buddy called me yesterday evening and said he had a flat tire and didn't know how to change it and didn't have AAA anymore, and he's pretty broke, and he didn't know what to do. I drove over and got his donut on in about five minutes. He was having trouble figuring out how to jack the car up because he couldn't find information about the jack-up point, which was the thing I'd had trouble with also, but on his car it was actually really easy to find and now he knows! I also told him to get a hydraulic jack and a cross wrench because he just had the kind of crappy standard jack and wrench that are a lot harder to use. 

Got a surprising amount done yesterday, though my coworker is the one who can mostly take the credit for that. He got the main ask re: the behavior working, and I learned a few really useful things seeing how he did it.

He just messaged me and asked if we can look at the CSS together. I'd completely forgotten I said we could do that this morning, although I did have a nagging feeling there was *something* I was supposed to do this morning along the lines of talking to someone at work. So going to wrap this up for now. "
"I am hoping that by doing this, inspiration will eventually come. I use to be told that I wrote well. That was so long ago. Maybe I can find my voice again. If nothing else, maybe writing into the void will help clear this jumbled mess that once resembled coherent thought. Who knows.

Today was relaxing. Spending time with the kiddos in the water on a too-hot-for-me day. There was a friendish person who joined my crew. Brought her kids along as well. She’s nice and friendly and someone to help take the edge off of loneliness. She is not a deep connection though. I can’t talk to her about most things on my mind. Just the superficial stuff. I don’t know her well. She’s a potential gossiper. I’m hoping I’m wrong. Only time will tell.

I should be typing away at something else right now. Work. Procrastination. Jumbled thoughts.

I have a date coming up. But I really don’t know what to think about this girl. She seems interesting. She seems smart. She is definitely witty. But she’s reserved, a little off balance. So am I. But I am resilient, I know how to rebalance myself. I tend to be drawn to the slightly weird, slightly dark. She is mysterious and draws me in. I want to know more. I want to taste her lips. I want her to take my hand in hers and lead me around on our outing. She reminds me of good times, of someone I use to be but still hold close to my heart. An image of my past, mixed with something new.

It’s not just her I want to explore. The world is full of beautiful and amazing people, full of people I long to know. I use to be so carefree with my love, until I started believing society. Society doesn’t understand a lot of things. A parent can love all their children unconditionally- see each individual child’s uniqueness, encourage them through their individual struggles, celebrate with them over their unique talents and successes, love them simply for being themselves. I have many friends whom I love with all my heart, each with a unique personality and reasons why I love them so dearly. Why should romantic love be any different? Before I was married, I was never monogamous. Hubby knew me then, supported my decisions. Encouraged me to have relationships with women throughout our marriage. What was stopping me? I have so much love to share, so much fun I want to experience, adventures I want to go on. I want to try so many things, how can one person be my everything?

Take for example my date that’s coming up. It is something I would have never done on my own, something hubby would have never wanted to do with me. But now I get to try it because there is someone new to open doors in my life that I would have never opened on my own. I want more doors to be opened for me, I want to experience things I would have never even thought about. This is a start. I am moving forward. I am finding myself again."
"I've been slacking off again. What with the internet being out and my younger cousin always wanting to play and just exploring Hawaii plus me being lazy as always, I haven't kept up my vow of daily journaling. However, I'm starting again today, which is, well, a start.

Hawaii is pretty nice, as usual. It's great to have near constant rain as opposed to the blistering Arizona sun. I went to the beach yesterday and played around with my cousin, and I've started working on my art. I'm eating a little healthier and I already discovered two new foods I really love. However, not everything is going so well. The first couple nights here I was up at night with a feeling of dread and thinking that it was a mistake for me to come here and it would only make my everything worse. I still haven't started walking here and I haven't been reading my books lately. I still think that this will turn out to be good for me, though.

Oh, and then there's the fact that my aunt and uncle are so unbelievably uptight about keeping things clean. I mean, I understand that they need to make sure there's no food out because cockroaches are rampant and can appear in even the cleanest of places, but they're also really anal about organization in general, and I am the absolute worst when it comes to keeping things nice and neat. Over the past week our clashing tendencies have been slowly driving me insane.

In other news, I hope my job offer isn't being taken, and I just learned that me therapist/life counselor is moving on to another job, so when I get back home I'll have a new one.

Well, time to hopefully do something productive."
"The frustration took over long ago. The things I want seem to be unattainable, so I’ve began to wonder what the point is. What’s the point of existing in a way that promises to bring you nothing more than to be frustrated because of what you want? 

I want to be fulfilled in a way outside of the surface level bullshit. I want to feel that when I wake up in the morning that there’s a potential for me to maybe actually get what I want. And it’s not happening. And it’s gotten to feel so old."
"Today, the age old question decided to make an appearance in my head: What will make me happy?

I can list a few things that make me happy now. Taking care of my plants, watching shows and movies, reading, painting and having it turn out the way I want, finishing projects. But what other things might bring me happiness in the future?

For a while now, I've had this fantasy of getting my dream job in a lab, moving out and getting a place in this environmentally friendly gated community downtown, lovingly cared for plants everywhere... and then I would invite my mom over and inwardly laugh my ass off at my defiance of some perceived belief that I could never live on my own. (Of course, when I actually stop to think about it, I seriously doubt any friends or family members of mine are trying to hold me back in any way.) But still, even if that fantasy was somehow fulfilled, would I be happy then?

I have a few more thoughts on this, but I can't seem to put my feelings into words as well as I'd like, and I'm tired. I just hope this won't lead to the eventual death of this habit I'm trying to grow."
"It's such weird timing.
My husband is leaving very early Monday morning and then will be leaving the country soon after that. My roommates are moving out this week. The kid will be back in daycare. Everyone's leaving at once. At some point by the end of next week I'll be alone in the apartment. Alone at all, for the first time in a while.

On the one hand, I'm feeling sad and worried about my husband, of course. Worried as the constant because no deployment is completely safe. Sad that he won't be here to celebrate Pride or my 30th birthday with me. Wistful that tomorrow will be the last time we go to the farmer's market together for a long time. The last time we spend an afternoon cooking together. 

I'm also going to miss the roommates. They were a lot of fun to have around and I was expecting them to be here a little longer. But I'm glad and relieved they've found a place and are getting out on their own. And I'm proud of my husband. He's excited for his next adventure.

It's all good stuff but there's still the tinge of sadness. And at the same time, I'm really looking forward to having the place mostly to myself again, not having to work around any other adults. I intend to deep clean the house after they move out, not because they aren't clean people but just because having too many people in a small apartment with all their stuff makes it hard to keep things really clean. 

Had some good sex just now.

Memorial was really cool but can't say too much about it. "
"So for about half a year, our family has been doing the 5 and 2 diet because for them, they wanted the health benefits, but for me I wanted to see how well I could retain my self control.

Fast forward to now, and I've really been feeling bad about my body, guilty even at the state of myself. And in doing so, I think I've developed an eating disorder, mainly some form of anorexia.

My weight from when we started fasting (6 months ago) to before I started skipping food for more days, was 86kg (190lbs) - 81kg (178lbs), and now in the past week alone, I've gone from 80kg (176lbs) - 76kg (167lbs). I don't know what weight I'm trying to achieve in doing so, but I just want to feel better about my body.

I understand the risks, and even though I'm well in the healthy BMI rating (192cm tall or 6""4') I don't feel happy about it. 

One other thing that's been troubling me is the lack of awareness and support for eating disorders in men. Just a thought. Thanks for reading if you did. "
"I’ve been trying to write for the past hour and a half, and something keeps stopping me. I yearn to journal, to document my moods consistently. I’ve tried writing in an actual diary, as well as a variety of apps. One app was real simple, rating my mood with a number and writing a very short description (a few words most). Even that was ultimately abandoned.


So to incentivize myself, I’ve been looking for a place to write where there are social features. I thought, maybe if I can make connections with others, I could have a community of support. So here I am, trying reddit.

&nbsp;

**Here are my thoughts for the day –**

**Mood:** (6) Overwhelmed

The anxiety has been creeping its way into the nooks and crannies of my everyday life. It used to be an unwanted visitor, only coming by on an occasional basis that I could manage. Now it’s like the beast has moved in, following me 24/7.  It gets bad at work. I think it might have something to do with the extra hours I requested and have gotten approved for. When I thought they would start last Wednesday, I had an anxiety attack in the morning that was so terrible that I couldn’t go in. And it’s been over a month since I called out for mental health purposes… I was so disappointed in myself. Thursday my work day was irregular and I wouldn’t be able to put in those extra hours, so I felt fine. But Friday – I don’t know how I dragged myself into work… it was so bad that it might have been worse than Wednesday, and normally I’d never push myself to endure work under those conditions, but I wasn’t going to call out a 2nd time that week, and lose more PTO that I desperately need to save up.
It ended up that the extra hours start tomorrow. I might have to brace myself for a really difficult morning again tomorrow. I don’t understand, though. I *want* those hours, I requested them. I acknowledge it’ll be a lot of work, and I’ll have less time to relax at home, but the extra $500 or so I get per check will be worth it. I need that money. I look forward to that money. So why could it be the culprit behind this crippling anxiety?

My heart rate has been high too, which scares me. I couldn’t stop my hands from shaking on Friday and was throwing up. I hate that anxiety can cause physical health problems… 

&nbsp;

I tried an EFT exercise for anxiety as a recommendation from a friend. It actually helped. I need to remember to try more of them.

&nbsp;

I have so many things on my mind, I feel like I’m behind in so many things yet have very little will to fix them. There are big things coming up in my life that will bring me happiness, yet I struggle to work towards them. Where does motivation die, I wonder? How can I fight it? I have the desire to work towards my goals, so why do I put minimal effort into them?

I need a creative outlet. I think it will bring me happiness, and allow me to feel productive. I tend to do more when I’m already feeling productive. But what can I do? Outright drawing is a battle to keep at.. Crafting I prefer to do with others… Maybe a game that I can create in? I have so many of them though, and don’t feel like playing any of them. I’m always eager to buy something new, but then it’s likely I won’t stick to that either. 

&nbsp;

Sometimes I think the depression is getting better. I do think the change and increase of meds has helped. I find a little more enjoyment in things, and I’ve actually been able to entertain myself and find enjoyment in solo activity, something I seriously couldn’t do before. But when if I take notice of the fact that I’m feeling content, I worry something might be wrong with that (since it’s not typical for me). A thought crossed my mind this weekend, *what if it’s mania?* I mean, I have been having trouble with money lately – been way too impulsive… So could it be? I’ve never had mania before, but it makes sense with the fact that feeling good is abnormal for me and I’ve been simultaneously impulsive. But I don’t think people with BPD get mania… Unless they have both BPD and Bipolar. And my mood shifts too quickly to be bipolar.

&nbsp;

Self-analyzing, that’s what I do 24/7. 

&nbsp;

I could say more things, but I think that’s enough for now. A solid first entry. I really hope I’ll keep this up. If I could write daily, or every other day, that would be ideal.
"
"Started having asthma attacks yesterday, probably caused by this incessant cough. I took a couple hits on the inhaler but my chest was still feeling tight. I stopped wearing the compression vest. Fuck it. I've got no swelling, NO drainage from the drain incisions as I was told there would be. My compression undershirt should come today or tomorrow and I'll wear that but I can't wear that fucking vest anymore, squeezing my ribs and making it hard to breathe. 

Now a good thing for asthma is caffeine. I had several jars of cold brew and drank four or five of them. They're very tiny jars so this was probably only sixteen to twenty ounces all together, but it's cold brew and pretty strong. I was vibrating. Ended up staying up until 2:30 in the morning and finished drafting the first episode script for this podcast. It came to a little over 2000 words, which was what I was aiming for. (About 15 minutes.) 

What I'm worried about is that it's boring. It's very hard for me to gauge since it's in my head like a movie and I have all this visual and backstory and everything, and it's hard to un-know that stuff and be able to tell whether the actual content on the page is interesting. Sent it to a friend who's a content creator and hoping he might have some useful insight. 

Still feeling asthmatic today. Hopefully being out of the vest will help. "
"It's Friday. Had surgery on Wednesday. Woke up today with no pain and haven't felt the need to take any medication all day, so that's pretty great. The only discomfort comes from the surgical compression vest, which is so goddamn tight I look like a tightlacing fetish model. 

I'm really glad my mom is here helping with my son. Even being off the meds and with the anesthesia probably mostly out of my system, I find myself doing loopy things once in a while like peeing with the door open when other people are around, or just now I typed my son's actual name and then caught myself. 

I'm feeling a little down and discouraged about the false start with the theatre company, wondering if I did something wrong or they just didn't like the scripts, and if so what it was they didn't like... but working on a fiction project with some friends and trying my hand at a pilot script again. Just have to keep making. 

I'm happy the surgery is over but not really feeling excited about my chest yet since I haven't actually seen it. "
"Things are in a much better place than they were yesterday.

My mom is here and settled in. I got medicated eye drops for my son and he's doing a lot better. Stuff is pretty much ready for tomorrow, just going to do one last round of dishes/laundry/obsessive puttering. I'm in a good spot with work to get everything wrapped up. 

The cowboy was over last night and he and the roommates and I lay around in their couch bed and watched a movie, and I snuggled him a bit and it felt really nice. After he left I said to the roommates, I am very concerned that I not do something that he's uncomfortable with and just goes along with, and they said ""Oh no, he really needs physical affection from someone who's not trying to fuck him."" Which I was happy to hear because that's what it is. I don't want to fuck him, or even kiss him, I just enjoy cuddling. (Which, husband's exact words during our most recent boundary-setting conversation: ""I don't give a fuck about cuddling."") 

It's weird because I've *never* been that person who likes physical affection that isn't leading up to sex, but I've just been so hungry for it. It felt so good to just sit and rub someone's arm. 

Feeling a bit bummed and discouraged still about the theatre company. Trying to put it out of my mind because I need to focus on healing. "
"I've been disgusted for probably the last month, and I don't think there's a way to get over it. Even the smallest things have come to irk me, and it's annoying. The irritability inside me burns like a flame that is hard to put out. 

I'm just tired of everything. People. Life. Everything. There's just not an easy way to make it feel better."
"I guess I'll have to just stick with it. This makes me anxious. Why do I want privacy? What have I done with it?

Yesterday I read a lot, but I was merely browsing the internet. Learned chess, classical music, read a story about Shizo Abe and then researched ways to kill myself. Just for the sake of it. And don't worry, I'm too coward to do it.

I also cried but that's common place. Browsing Reddit and the internet in general seemed like a good idea ""I don't need to be alone anymore"", well, guess no. I'm more lonely and depressed, things are going pretty badly.

I also researched about Red Pill, well, the day wasn't so bad after all, and I got new insights how to deal with M.F. I took my bike and passed in front of her house. Just to check. Her car was there. Which means nothing.

I got upset with the cashier of the small market that's open on holidays. I don't know if he was trying to make small talk, but I got the impression he was making fun of me for buying food when most guys would buy only beer in such a market. Every time I go there I spend about 50 bucks and this is the treatment I get? I know I should plan myself, this would get me food at a cheaper price but I don't really like to plan my Sundays and holidays.

I got a nice advice from Red Pill. I shouldn't mess with V.B. and maybe even M.F. Messing with girls from workplace is a bad idea in general. It's a fast way to treat your job like shit, lose all the respect there and get in trouble very easily, gossiped around. Let's not make everything worse, shall we?

Now let's talk about what's been bugging me. A girl happy for seeing me. Not a fake smile like M.F.'s. Truly happy to see me. When was that it happened again? 2003? This seems like another life now. 

My research yesterday about RedPill got me thinking what is it that I want from a woman, and it turns out it's not so much. M.F. could do if I gave her a chance, but that ain't happening.

I'm broken. What I want from a girl is this. This fantasy. She smiling for seeing me. Only this. Goddamn this is so depressing. I'm so pathetic. Why am I dreaming about something I can get?

Because I, I can't seem to believe in a true smile even if I saw one. ""Why is this hag showing her teeth at me"", ""she wants my money"", well, it turns out that my fantasy is crazy. Because a girl would have to smile at me for no reason, while I make a weird face of distrust and like I'm going to kill someone.

""You're so quiet today"", ""you're so serious"", yeah, you have no idea. I'm dense. A pit.

I only could sleep yesterday when I turned off the computer, was restless although it was 03:00 AM, and writing in my notebook put me at ease, with pen and paper. I guess staring at a screen at night makes me nervous. 

I also got my so dreamed chess rating above 1K. I might lose it in the next days but it's nice to see I'm improving. This inspires and empowers me. I want to get better at chess. As stupid as it is for a man on his 30s chasing a goal as stupid and childish like getting better at chess.

I know. Don't beat yourself up. Haha. Ha. Life is a bad joke. Today I must not avoid my course. I have to finish it today. The Self Authoring thing. Today I have to write about how my trauma affected me. So it's an important day. I must go shopping for groceries later too.

I want to read more in my native language and I don't see writing an online diary like this getting me nowhere near of my goal. I really feel like quitting this too, but I guess I just have to stick with it. I'm proud of my notebooks, I have entries since I started living alone, 1 year ago, but most of the time I don't want to keep it, and I wanted to read it safely. Or to say that I *feel like killing myself* without worrying that this might get me expelled from my cottage and called the police. Feeling like doing something and actually doing the thing are not the same. And I need to do that self-improvement program online, so it's only logical for me to write stuff in English and online.

I wish I didn't worried about every little single detail, but that's how I am. I wish I wasn't paranoid, but I am. Something is wrong with me. My mental health is not the best, but what can I do? I don't know how to fix it yet.

If someone is thinking of killing himself/herself, I found this helpful. I plan to read it again a few times from now on.

http://www.cracked.com/article_15658_the-ten-minute-suicide-guide.html

I don't really know if I want to deal with the bulk of having many paper notebooks. I want to consider carefully from now on. And I overthink stuff.

EDIT: I was advised that I am not doing this for myself, so this is my last post."
"No ocean can swallow this Madness. No sun can split this Darkness. No sound can pierce this Silence. No substance can cease this Pain. 
I'm all alone. But don't worry, I'll be fine. This is the world I was born in. The world I've grown up in. The world that I'm still struggling to live in. The world that I'll Die in. "
"Okay, I need to start making a change. Accepting some of my issues and committing to changes will be a big step forward, so this is going to be that. I still am not at the point of doing this to people I know personally, but if I have it all recorded... maybe one day.

One step at a time though.

Some things I need to admit. Own up to.

I am fairly sure I have a gambling addiction. Past couple months have had some self destructive behavior and this was a large part of it. It is something I sunk into when things were getting particularly rough, hoping for some good luck that would change that. It did not however, and I have been living with the consequences of that.

Quitting this cold turkey is too difficult for me at this time, so I instead have it very limited in a way I can't adjust. I have 1 online poker thing installed, and self enforced limits (thankfully the software forces me to hold true to it if i have a particularly bad day). and have it set to a very very low limit. That will do for now, and hopefully I can do better with this in the future.

There have also been times I have been wary I have a drinking problem. 
That runs in my family very hard. Something I grew up around and made me wary. Which I handled very well, but things have been rough recently and I noticed an uptrend in it. Thankfully I am aware of it and moving forward I am forcing myself to follow some rules that both control how often I drink and how much I drink.

The plan has been that when I go grocery shopping for the week, I get cash back for whatever I am planning to drink for the week. Its the only time I take out cash, and I do not let myself buy with card. That way I can make a choice in what I wish to do for that week while I am sober and not in a bad mood... while doing this, it is much easier for me to keep my weekly drinking budget under 10 dollars... it has been a big help. Also, I don't buy big bottles anymore, since I know I can drink quite a lot of it and not even realize. I make a trip the day of I want something, and buy the smaller, less budget friendly ones. Then I have a cap on the day and I can't get out of control. If anyone you know has an issue with this, recommend this method to them if they can't just stop all the way... it has been very helpful for me.

Moving forward now, I need to be less procrastinating and spend my free time doing productive things.

I am very aware that I have some symptoms of depression, but I believe that is from current events in the past couple months, and not a chronic thing. So I have been taking steps to stop letting me get the better of myself, and fight this head on. Proactive plans to stop from sinking into the hole that is so hard to climb out of, and self awareness that not only do I need to change, but I need to stop dealing with things in my usual way.

By never talking to anyone and playing off how serious it is.

So this is the next step in that plan. Start being vocal, even if only anonymously... even if I don't expect anyone to read it. Just getting it down on paper (computer, whatever, you know what I mean) and commiting to things when I say I am going to do them.

So for today? I got a lot of work to do at home today. Prep work for my job. Going to start that within the next hour, and that will be the only thing I do today at all. No more Youtube or anything like that. Work, make a nice dinner, work, get a good night sleep for work tomorrow.

And hopefully things are looking up moving forward.

Be back tomorrow."
"It's really late in the day, but it's a start.

I'm putting myself back together in time to see family and not look like I'm falling apart. Like I just dealt with a hurricane of hell. That I'm not waiting for someone and wondering where they are all the time. That I am not going crazy and most certainly haven't been doing what I am needing to do to make the most of my life.

This is my start. here is me getting out of a guest bed, straightening my clothes and hair, putting my stuff together and picking my mother up for the first time in a week. I will eat dinner with them, clean up a little and then i'm reading, I'm grinding I'm studying for the long haul. 

Any time a memory comes back I am devoting my life to living like a prayer, a mantra of coming back. Reminding myself of my name, my birthdate, my age, the date today, the time, what am I doing. Anything to bring me back to right now this moment because I can't stand the past and the future is soo much to worry about. So here I am. It's the start of a new day. It is time to get up."
"Dear Diary, 

Today I was reminded everyone leaves. And I learned that that's okay. It's part of life. Everyone leaves."
"Finally spending the night at home. It's supposed to be some big snow storm tonight. All the schools are closed for tomorrow and some businesses as well. So far I haven't seen anything come down. I'm hoping to wake up later in the night and see it all come down and watch the quiet calm of the snow falling.

Tonight my husband and I watched a show together. It had a valentines day theme and during the commercial breaks (damned Hulu) we talked about our own Valentines day plans which are going to be short because I have to work that day.  Looking forward to having a lunch with him. I need to figure out what to get him though. I always have trouble with his Valentines day gift. I keep thinking I should get him something he needs , but maybe it should be something whimsical, something or romantic? I don't know. I will have to think about it.

**Gratitude:** Today I am grateful for love. I am also grateful for snow. My son is also sleeping mostly through the night. I am really grateful for that.

"
"I saw you today. I thought I was over you. I thought I'd be alright. But here I am shaking 2 hours later. There goes months of getting over you. Lost to a smile. I love you. 

"
"I made a realisation about myself a while ago. It wasn't a pleasant one I assure you but it was necessary none the less. 

I'm meant to be a loner. It's my purpose in life. I don't have many friends and limited contact with the world beyond my bedroom. I've had numerous other halves and I've managed to be successful with them all in some way or another. Two of them I got through uni work and helping them improve their lives, and then I had to move on. One of them I prevented his suicide and helped him out, heard from mutual friend that he's doing great. One of them I helped realise that he's not a loser and that he will be ok. One of them I counselled through depression and the last one, I sorted his house out and made it liveable. 

But I end up alone every time. I'm only good in small doses. This is an upsetting yet powerful realisation and I'm going to start the SO project. I will chart progress on helping them. I'll be a fix-it girl. And then I'll move on. 

Let my journal be my legacy. I will keep you updated. And for all the lonely time in between I will fill with other things to distract myself. I can do this. Today is the day I make this pledge to be alone forever unless I'm improving someone else's life. Let's do this "
"Yesterday I took my daughter to the park again and she still didn't try and play with the other kids. I'm not sure what to do. I see her struggling with making friends but I am not sure how to help her except to make her feel loved and give her more opportunities to just be out there. 


Today I got my exercise in and I am still keeping a food journal. Losing weight and feeling healthier. The daily exercise has done a lot for my mood as well and just my general mental health.  


I have to go into work tonight and I am not dreading it as much as I usually do. In the past I've had to struggle with a steadily ~~shrinking uniform~~ growing body and I felt miserable and ashamed at work. Not the case these past few weeks. Feeling a lot more comfortable and actually eager to go to work. 


**Gratitude:** Today I am grateful that my family is safe. There was some fear and worry about something that happened nearby no one was hurt. I am also grateful for my husband letting me sleep in today. Oh yeah and I am grateful for no longer wearing a tight fitting uniform. 😊"
It's depressing as hell. I have been procrastinating leaving this place for over a year now. I only possess taleṅt and intellect. No willpower. No confidence. None at all. 
"I took a walk today. It was at the only place we hadn't been. The lake was still and quiet even though the storm passed through just last night. It was a little chilly, I should have brought a jacket. You were always telling me to grab one; just in case. I also walked up to the overpass above 40. I drive under it every morning and evening, but today I took the time to look at it from above. It was busy for a Sunday. At least a car a second. Where were they going? Who were they seeing? I can see for miles, yet here I am. The more freedom I seem to get the less I'm able to use. I suppose that's life though. One day I'm going to take off; I won't say goodbye, I won't say a word. I'll just leave, off to different things. To a different me. But today, for now, I'll drive home and live a life where I don't feel free. I'm trapped in an open world; I'm just looking for you."
"Dear Diary,
It's so difficult meeting friends when you are an adult, married, and not working/going to school where you might meet people. My friendships seem superficial and lack intimacy lately. I miss the days of staying up all night with a friend talking on the phone or sleeping over watching movies. Is that chapter of friendship over? I get really excited when I meet someone awesome at a bar and bond over random things, exchange numbers excitedly and promising each other ""we are totally gonna hang out again"". Then I reach out after a reasonable time (to not seem needy), plans are made, and then flaked upon. I've gone to a few meetups but people are either not in my age range or I have nothing in common with them. I am well traveled, educated, love animals, movies, TV, politics, being outside, drinking, eating and all the normal things people have fun doing together and talking about. My husband doesn't seem to mind not having friends and, don't get me wrong, we have a great time together. However, I need someone I can gab with! I'm not expecting to have slumber parties where we braid each others hair, but it would be really cool to have someone I can trust with my secrets and who I can count on to be there when I need a friend (and vice versa) besides my husband. My mom tells me it's easier when you have kids because you meet people through school and whatever organization they are part of. But that's years away, shit! Maybe I can find a friend on the internet...never tried it...but now it's out there. Ball is in your court. I promise I'm not this pathetic in real life! Thanks for reading :) "
"Basing your values

On your idea of what a person is

Is the root of hypocrisy.

People aren’t a set entity.

People are continuous, adaptable, searching beings.

Sometimes people will do things that don’t fit into their personal file you created of them.

In fact, all people will at some point.

Then it’s not your responsibility to put them back into “their place” that you created in your head.

They are not you. They are not your possession. It is not their responsibility to act according to the rules you set for them.

Their only responsibility is to do what they want to do, and take responsibility for every action’s consequences.

Bad people can do good things,

And deserve the same praise.

Good people can do bad things,

And deserve the same punishment.

Actions are all that matter.

Be respectful towards the area of change a person is righteous to have.

Failure to do so might result in the justifiable action of people cutting you off.

You can’t expect a flower to remain a seed forever,

it will grow right around the rock,

and sometimes even through it."
"I have been struggling with my current lifestyle for a while now. It’s almost a predictable pattern of continuous procrastination. I’ve switched my day and night in a vile effort to increase my productivity hours, but it’s having a negative effect. 
Right now, I feel perfectly capable of sitting here and using my phone for hours, but can’t get myself to sit on my computer and get some work done (plenty of deadlines ahead). Everyday I tell myself that I will get more work done but I end up wasting most of the day and feeling disappointed and angry at myself. 
I’m thinking of taking a power nap but then I know that will turn into full sleep just like it did yesterday. I’m so weak. Why can’t I help being so weak? "
"will i get the things i need to get done, done today ? ..."
"I'm sitting here about to blow. The frustration and pain bottled up inside of me is ready to come out in a fury. I can feel my eyes welling up with tears and I want to scream. Why is it that I can never have anything be easy or what I want? And it's not just every once and awhile, it's daily. 

I've spent all night wondering what the point is to any of this anymore. And I can't seem to find it. I never asked for any of this. I never asked to even exist."
"*When you ask me 'how are you,  everyday,  it makes me hate you so much. '*

I had nothing against the question,  or you really,  but I couldn't stand the way you said it.  Like I needed to be out in the world,  doing something amazing with myself and conquering new challenges each day. 

You asked me the question,  *everyday *, like I needed to be normal. 

I wasn't though. There are a lot of things I still am not.  And I guess that's alright.  I still think about how one person can have so much grief.  So young and so sad,  it's bound to lead to something dangerous. 

But in a way,  my sadness is vague. It is bitter and comes on from seeing someone else living,  living like I wish I could and living like I wish I wouldn't. 

*That's the thing about pain,  it demands to be felt.*

That is actually my favorite line in any book.  A YA romance of the 21st century no less.  I love that line because it is true. Pain does demand to be felt.  And when I sit down and cry in the bath for no reason,  I feel it.  

I hold on to every *suckish* memory and amplify it.  My therapist has told me I need help,  that my medication works well with character  readjustment.  Because my character is a windup toy to be taken apart and *readjusted*.

I need fixing. 

And maybe my loathing of your mundane question is indicative of my bitterness.  Of my need to hold on to any kind of love,  knowing that I deserve better but holding on to the pathetic shred I have.  The parts I can get. 

And I guess that's okay too.  Of course it is. "
"It was over a year ago we met and I still miss you. But I know it is the idea of you.  You taught me how physical intimacy can be so powerful.  I never held anyone's hand like I did with you. I never felt safer in someone's arms like I did with you.  Your kisses on my forehead were so very touching.  The way we held each other during the night... was incredible.

I wish you didn't pull away in the end. But there's a reason for everything.  I had to feel that heartbreak. It's a lesson learned so that one day when I meet the love of my life... I will not take him for granted.  

Part of me really hopes you are truly happy.  The other part is too mad at how you just disappeared one day without explanation.  It was cowardly. Maybe you didn't want to see me cry, but I did.  Not anymore... I am hopeful to find love again. 

Thank you for showing me what I need."
"Oily, delicious and you regret it immediately afterwards. 

Funny thing is, the screen name I had for the best thing that ever happened to me in my life was when one of my screen names was 'deep fried eyebrows'. These eyebrows are now wriggling out in the open, without a hint of shame and cocked right up there when boasting about just how amazing my partner is (I'm so lucky). 

Anyway. I worked years in either chronic emotional and/or physical pain to get this far. Dug myself out of depression, metamorphisised from the most socially impeded and anxious autistic kid to a flirting social butterfly, and most of all, finally stopped being a lazy tosser. Psychologists, SSRIs, support groups, academic help-- Grades up! Depression down. Not the best, but better than I've ever done in my life in a while after trauma. 

And then the disaster of Circumstance^TM struck. Fuck you, Nurgle. Cue everybody getting sick, me catching influenza, followed by strep throat for 5 weeks and getting costochondritis. Coughing so bad fucked my rib cage cartilage and connective tissue into constant debilitating pain, no recovery for another few weeks. I was bed-bound for two, taking mid-semester exams while having a fever and had to submit an application for exam sickness consideration late because I couldn't afford the application fee. 

Cue trainwreck of the beginnings of a relapse into depression, undoing literally everything I ever did. I played Civ 5 for 6 hours straight one day, slept, did nothing for another day and felt like absolute and utter garbage. I started crying myself to sleep again a couple of nights ago from how long I had to keep bearing the pain and how I couldn't sleep. 

I don't know why I expected a better outcome after working so hard to get out of depression. The deep fried disappointment has now coated me with the oily soggy soup of self-pity, and I'm just hoping I don't absolutely drown this time and fly out of the pan faster before depression burns everything in my life to a crisp again. 

Hey, at least if I come out golden this time, I'll be one hell of a crispy fry. "
"This is specifically for the president and his supporters. 

Can you tell an undocumented vs documented person? If our (Hispanic) neighbour happens to go out to get the mail, they shouldn't need to carry their papers for fear some vigilante demand them. 

I am Dutch, raised Muslim, with a Moroccan father and Palestinian mother. In the Netherlands, I am treated as the Trump administration treats Hispanic-Americans. Never mind that I hold a PhD from Stanford. Never mind that I'm an ex-Googler.

Income may have allowed me the opportunity to get out of the worst of discrimination, but a large amount of achievement is luck. And luck discriminates arbitrarily. 

To wit, I was at Google before it went public. This was 100% luck. Yes, it was skill that enabled me to get the education necessary to get to the stage where Google would talk to me, but I could have also joined any number of companies that have not done as magnificently with the same credentials (and they would have taken me). 

So, yes, Mr Wilders, this piece of scum was worth more at age 27 than you. And, Mr Trump, this [bad hombre](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/10/20/from-mexican-rapists-to-bad-hombres-the-trump-campaign-in-two-moments/) inherited very little, other than being born in a country that decided, unlike yours, to give a helping hand to me, rather than send me away.

"About 2 months back I started an experiment in mindful eating to make myself aware of the food I consume. And for the first time in my life I could actually taste the burgers at fast-food chains like McDonalds.

Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say __I didn't__ taste. McDonald's Big Mac has been my go-to staple junk food for years but I suddenly realized how bland the burger patty is. The sauce is delicious, I'll give McD that but the beef was just meh. At a local fast-food chain, I realized the bun tasted empty, almost like biting into Styrofoam. 

Of course, it hasn't been all great. I also started eating avocados because I've heard of their health benefits and I just do not like the texture. But I found a way around it by making smoothies."

"I'm doing some ""mental clearing"" this morning and thought back to an event years ago that had left me in a difficult spot. In my mind, it was like I had been fervently climbing up a hill to reach the summit and see what was on the other side. Giving up and turning back were not options, I had to reach the summit and see for myself what was waiting there.

And in my mind, when I reached the top I found an abandoned village. It was a place where once people had lived but no longer. People had once been born here, grown up here. They had met friends, married, started families, worked out their livelihood here until they passed away peacefully. It used to be a place bustling with activity, chatter, laughter and life. But no more.

The people hadn't died out or faded away. In my mind, they had made a conscious decision to collectively move some place else. I imagined asking the spirit of the elders that lingered in that abandoned village why they had left. Their answer was simple yet poignant:

“We moved on because there is no more life here”

They didn't leave because of disaster or because they were forced out of the place. Instead, the place itself no longer had any life for them so they made the obvious choice to move on.

It’s time for me to move on as well."
"Screaming the lyrics to bohemian rhapsody? come on, who doesn't love that. Formal was incredible last night. 

I wore this spicy red dress i had to bunch in my hand all night. May have got in the way a little but it prevented my arms from dangling awkwardly and *that* my friend, is a priority.

A spoke to me. I write about him a lot but love comes in crashing waves and it helps to calm it a bit. After speaking and making more male friends i've realised I'm not as interested anymore. 

I cant help but overthink *every* little thing. Carrying conversation is pretty challenging, especially when i'm beating myself up about it but I think i'll spend some time today working on that. [note to future self; work on this]

Today was pretty chill. We watched some speeches in english and one really struck me.  He said something like: 'life is meaningless'. Sounds edgy, but i completely agree. If we spend our life searching for meaning, by the time we find that meaning we'll almost be dead. 
I'm not dismissing the idea that there *could* be some mystical meaning, but rather that looking for it for it is unnecessary. 

Seeing N on Sunday which should be interesting. I'll update then.

"Hey Non-Descript Boy, 

I'm not really sure what I have to say to you. I'm not really sure if I have much to say at all but I feel like I have feelings that I need to express, maybe to you. Maybe to the world in general. It's 1am on a Monday night. A typical time for me to be awake when I don't have any morning classes the next day. I've spent my evening listening to the last 2 hours of an audiobook about being an alcoholic which ends on a slightly positive note after a relapse into crack and random hookups with strange men. Then I watched videos of Mac Demarco being the eccentric, creative, character he is. Eating hot wings until his eyes erupted in tears. I moved onto a youtube video where Charlie Day does much of the same. I could go on... It's been a media-rich, busy night. Which is a nice change for me. I used to be able to just get lost on the internet with such ease, delving into old obscure subreddits, watching youtubers with such regularity that I knew more about their personal lives than some of my closest friends. It took a night of slight mania for me to get back into it and it's a bit nostalgic for me. 

I just finished an episode of ""This is Us"" which was the show I was watching in Portland when you came back with food gifts. It was beautifully depressing as most episodes of this excellent drama are. I had been mulling over sending you a note most of the night but without any idea what I really wanted to convey. Generally when I write to people I go in without a definitive plan, forsaking those outlines English teacher recommended in high school and just hoping that if I write long enough, fighting my way through enough tangents and tidbits that are painfully focused on myself I'd eventually land on what I wanted to say in the first place. (Alas I'm in a writing class for self-reflection, and journaling is all I've ever known. Excluding those long research papers... ask me anything about great white sharks, Queen Elizabeth 1, histrionic personality disorder, or Aramark - the company that provides food to the dining halls - and I'm your girl) 

My life is pretty great. I like to quote Louis CK because this quote has resonated with me more than anything else said by some celebrity trying to give his empty-calorie philosophy on how to lead a perfect, idealistic life. To paraphrase what Louis said - as long as your past sucks your life is getting better. I have a tendency to not look at the present with wide eyes because it detracts from my happiness. I assume this happens when you grow up in a very unstable environment with two parents who suffer from crazy mood swings and you're transported from house to house every other weekend or so. You might be able to empathize with the latter bit at least.

One of the seven deadly sins is envy and I find that to be a trait that I lean away from more than most. But as miserable as I may seem on certain days, or as erratically frustrated as I may come off with my mother or my roommates, I am always the first one to admit that I have it damn good. We have a tendency of not appreciating what we have in front of us, I know I am always rushing onto the next thing. I graduated from high school a year early and I'm planning on doing the same in University, for example. Not because I'm a genius (in fact I fear that every year I am losing exponentially more intellectual potential), but just because I'm rushing through life. I'm always hoping that the next thing I jump onto will be better (and if we make the move from high school to college it has been), and God do I get so bored with everything (Louis CK would be ashamed of me) I've always loved working so I'm in the mindset that even if I become a workaholic, even if I'm working 60+ hours and it takes everything out of me and I'm completely and utterly emotionally alone, I'll be making a life for myself. Reliance on only my self is my goal, even if my personal life just wisps by like dreamy scenery  passing by from the seat of a train in some old movie. Any accolades I receive for a job well done will be enough for me, even if it's not enough to fill up one of those ""Chicken Noodle Soup for the Soul"" books. Maybe I'll take up running or guitar as a side project and I'll find solace in the fact that I am talented enough, and wealthy enough to be something somebody's parents, if not my own, would be proud of. 

It's not true though. Although I get so fucking bored of people, so easily agitated with the smallest things, connecting with other humans, really connecting is what matters. One day you and I might stop talking. You'll be mad at me for a while, or maybe I'll be confused and hurt or confounded as to why you don't seem to care, but the memories of the moments we had together that made us feel something, no scary mess down the road that we can't predict (but take one sociology/economics/physics class and look at a few stock market graphs and you'll notice that what goes up must come down), can take that away from us. That's why I get scared that once in a while I might feel more for you than you feel for me. I purposefully remain closed off emotionally because my parents hurt me and when I was just entering the dating world at a raw 15, sweet as a dream, a boy or two I met on the internet broke my heart, I don't talk about it because I'm extremely secretive about things that I think come off as childish or lame. Then I lost some weight and gained some confidence, at least enough to put my social phobia disorder on the back burner, long enough to accept a date invite from someone who was much too old for me. A person in a position of power at my first job who did unforgivable things to a kid. Soon after I hopped into a relationship with an emotionally abusive 27 year old who didn't listen when I said no and made me feel bad for existing, acted like a 12 year old when I broke up with him and the darkness inside of me makes me think thoughts that the complacent, agreeable, sweet, helpful, loving 15 year old me wouldn't dare to think toward someone I polarize as a monster nowadays. 

And maybe I'm a little broken. Maybe I'm afraid of commitment because I know there will be a break up and when the break up occurs I'm going to lose everyone I've met through this person. Maybe deep down I'm afraid they're going to threaten me with suicide again or blame me because they fall back into whatever their worst state of mind is once more. Maybe I know that no matter how nice they are now they're going to become this person who says terrible things about the person they once said they love and maybe I don't want to be the bad guy. It's sad that I find myself hoping that if I keep someone in limbo I can still get what every human craves and needs - love, a feeling of community, adulation, touch, desire, companionship, and the ability to have intellectual discourse. But it's not where people want to be stuck. I joke often about boys always wanting to girlfriend me, and my flippant nature really isn't an attractive trait. Making fun of people for wanting monogamy or definition to the affection is by nature ridiculous. We all want someone to rely on and someone to rely on us, even if we can't admit it sometimes. There's no trust that this person will not leave my life at any given moment and so I brace myself, which is ironic or just plain delusional because I'm the one that's always leaving first. I wonder to myself, if I can be prepared for someone leaving me because of something moderately minuscule then why can't they? How weak for them to care so much! But if I dig a little deeper this is a personal dilemma is hypocritical at best, sociopathic at worst. 

This draws me in to earlier when I went on a small bit of short bursted messages. Something I haven't done to you in a while. I can open up only when I've been opened to. Or in desperation. Or if it's been weighing on me for a while. I always speak my truth eventually. Sometimes I act like things bother me but then get over them within a short period of time and apologize for caring for something that is either silly or I can't articulate properly. Other times things weigh on me for a longer period of time, and I mull them over hoping that I can communicate why I find myself staring at you and hoping that you'll read my mind and tell me that you appreciate the thing I did or you want to hold my hand or that I make you feel less lonely. I want you to speak your truth too. Strangely I'm most comfortable and confident when I am first getting to know somebody, then I have a moment of panic where I feel like I like them too much, then I back off and settle into a pattern, eventually rounding out to a phase of insecurity. I imagine this is where normal people actually start off, and I'm doing things backwards. I'd have to take a few more psychology courses to analyze that with anything more than pure speculation. I found myself sitting on the insecurity throughout the weekend. The thoughts clouded me at random times. On the plane ride there, for instance, I sat and I really wanted to touch you. To hold your hand, or put my head on your shoulder. But there was this block. Like the kind of block you might feel when you're hanging out with someone and you're trying to make the first physical move but you're terrified of rejection. And I don't know how this is possible where we stand now, but that's where I was. I have a tendency of being strongly, and painfully aware of any kind of social cues. It might be an amplification of my social anxiety and fear of anyone finding me agitating in anyway, but I felt this feeling like you might not want me to touch you, or I was being a nuisance. Things that are so ludicrous looking from an outside perspective. But I also feel that it's difficult to know when or if you find frustration in my actions or words when you won't let me in.

I know we're not in a relationship, and you haven't brought it up in a long time. Which is admirable to be honest because if you did my stomach would twist into knots and I would probably turn red and shrug it away with some sort of apologetic statement. But I feel like we must say out loud what I believe we're both thinking - we're basically there. The only things that would change is sticking a label on it, having huge repercussions for seeking out affection elsewhere, and me digging deeper for you to open up to me. As it is now I know that this is our biggest roadblock in mutual happiness, at least from my perspective.

I get so frustrated because deep down I'm sexist. Maybe it's because I've always had trouble connecting with women because of different interests. Maybe because I have mommy issues. Maybe it's years spent combing through reddit threads entrenched with terrible commentary on the ""bitches who won't fuck us"" and it got to my head at 14, 15, 16, etc. I hate being associated with any even slightly negative feminine traits. Female on female jealousy, vapidity, anything to do with shopping or being irresponsible with money, commentary on my driving, and very unfortunately for me in the situation we're currently in - anything to do that is stereotypical in a relationship such as nagging, saying ""you never listen to me"" (although I say it with a large tinge of irony), and of course, begging for some goddamn verbal communication and a desire to talk about feelings. Trust me, this isn't even a female thing, but the stereotype remains front and center in our popular media. When it comes to people I've dated I fall in the middle of the begging to talk about feelings chart. But I feel ashamed when I ask for it. The reason I need it is because the person I'm banging, the person I choose to curl up with multiple times per week and talk about work and friends and the hobbies that may consume one person but not the other, I want to know that if I ask them how they're feeling they'll tell me what's on their mind. When I ask them how they're feeling about us they'll give me polysyllabic answers, and when I ask them how they feel about me they'll at least bullshit their way through a good enough answer that I'll feel like I do bring them some value that isn't of a pure animalistic nature. Because I think that's what a relationship without communication is, sex, warmth, and sharing experiences by virtue of proximity - why, that's what apes do. 

Alas it is nearly 3am and my mind is tired. My paragraphs are long and I apologize for that. I'm hoping you will read this throughout work slowly to absorb fully without it being too distracting. I appreciated the conversation we had earlier tonight. It meant a lot to me and it felt like a breakthrough. Regardless I still had so much left to say, as I'm sure you can see. I hope you can make sense of all this and we can have a conversation about it at some point. I'll be thinking about you as I fall asleep.

"A few days ago, I was at the Nou Camp here for prayers to my namesake and met a couple of entrepreneurs who were hell-bent on killing the password. Sounded like a good idea to me, so I wrote them a cheque on the spot. 

They just texted me saying they have a beta client(!) Their CEO is from Telefonica -- this country's largest mobile operator -- and has landed their Paraguayan subsidiary. I lost out on unifyID a few months ago, but they seem to be flailing. 

I won't name these guys until they're ready to go public, but that's the nature of the field."
"I just read a sad article, and being as hormonal as I am today, the waterworks just started up. That led to all the pain I feel inside coming out too. 

The pain of wanting what I do so badly is eating me alive. The thing about it is, I can't really do much about it. The two things I really, really want are both reliant on another person wanting it too. And I can't make people want to do things for me or with me or whatever. But I still torture myself inside over all this dumb shit. Like why? What did I ever do to deserve this hand I was dealt? What did I ever do to deserve this pain that seems to have no cure anywhere at all?

"I was working at the thrift store today, sorting through someone's donations. Apparently, the stuff belonged to a guy that died. I found a t-shirt that was signed to the man that died by some kind of famous singer. It was in a special box unlike the rest of the clothes that just came in big trash bags. ""Do we keep this?"" I asked the lady in charge. She takes the shirt from me and picks up a pair of grubby, dirty shoes with it and throws it into the bin,and I looked at the shirt for a second. I felt sad. It may be a silly reason to be sad but I thought it was sad that someone's prized possession was thrown away just like that. It was disrespected, i dunno. It's stupid. "
"I bascially gave it away in the headline here, but it's not a lie. See below, from the logfile:

I want to text you, but I don't know what to say, or even if you'll respond. That's one of the worst parts about this, that you're so elusive and mysterious. But that's also the part I find to be the most attractive."
"This incident happened a couple days ago. I was just remembering how ridiculous it was.

Picture me, jumping up and down and waving my arms to catch the attention of a stranger in a white jumpsuit outside the glass door to my apartment building. He looks everywhere except for at me. I’ve been banging on the door and waving for the past 10 minutes, yelling to get his attention over the roar of the industrial-grade pressure washer that’s being used to strip the paint from apartment’s brick exterior. No luck, and I’m already incredibly late for a meeting. I sit on the steps inside and resign myself to watching the watery red paint drip down the glass. The noise from the pressure washer dies down and the waterfall of paint becomes a more manageable trickle. 

This is my opportunity. I crack the door open and yell as politely as I can to make myself heard over the noise, “Can I come out?” 

Jumpsuit man seems surprisingly unsurprised when I catch his attention. Maybe he knew I was there the whole time? His response is not very helpful: “Nope, you can’t come out now,” leaving me more confused than I was before I asked. *When can I come out? Why not now? Did you know I was there? Why was there no notice that I would be trapped inside my apartment by dripping paint?* Instead of asking any of these questions I go back and sit on the steps like an idiot.

Half an hour later, the noise dies down again and this time I am bolder, determined to escape. I stick my head and arm all the way out of the door to get jumpsuit man’s attention. “HEY!” Oh, too aggressive. I switch to pleading. “Can I come out *now*?” 

“Nope, sorry, we don’t want to have anyone come out because of the lead paint.” Jumpsuit man states this matter-of-factly as two fat drops of paint land on top of my head and on my arm.

“AH. Okay great, thanks!” I mutter, although this is clearly not great, and I hurriedly retreat back to the safety of the dark apartment stairwell.

I remain trapped and withering from boredom on the steps until three other men in jumpsuits yell that it’s time for a pee break and tramp past me in their cloth-covered boots. The last man in takes pity on me and offers to give me a piggy-back ride out. I am pretty sure it’s a joke but at that point I’m ready to accept any form of transportation that will allow me to escape. Instead of a piggy-back ride, the man brings me some boot covers and graciously holds the door open as I duck through the lead-infested doorway. My knight in shining armor instructs the original jumpsuit man to take my boot covers when I get past the puddles of paint. Jumpsuit man complies but definitely does not seem enthused, but this doesn’t even faze me as I make my break for freedom and speedwalk down the sidewalk toward my meeting which is nearly over."
"So I got a bit anxious today. But I noticed my body tensing up and did my best to stay open until the meeting was over. When I got back to my car I noticed the tension still there so I called a friend to chat and we ended up going for an early lunch. It's 10pm now and I'm still feeling some tension but only a little.

I've said this to many people and it's time I take my own advice: this takes effort and time. There may not be a quick fix. We have a goal of wanting to be free from anxiety/worry/depression/whatever but it's not going to come over-night. Instead of focusing on perfection, focus on progress.

And today I made progress."
"The last ten days have been a whirlwind, and not the one I had ever imagined. A friendship that had been formed over 15 years ago broken in an instant because of mistake. A secret that I had kept for years that I would have preferred to keep hidden exposed. A death of a family member who I hadn't seen in an even longer time that I found out about through Facebook. 

I feel so many things right now. And I wish I knew how to deal with it all. But I don't. I'm hurting a lot, and the one person I would usually go talk to about this is one of the main reasons I feel this way. 

And then there's the person who I want to become closer with who ignores me most of the time. And I don't know why.

Life is hard right now."
"Dear Diary,


I heard his story from mutual friends before we actually met.  I knew even before we met that this would never work out.  I never wanted to date someone who has kids from previous relationships...just because of the complications...his two children, I can accept.  I can't accept his ex-wife who cheated on him trying to make his life hell when he's with me.


I don't tolerate drama well -- especially when this lady is a grown ass woman with a kid she should know how to act better than me.  And if she keeps trying to make our lives hell, no one else will want to date her.


My guy's brother told me my guy's first baby mama is alright but that I should watch out for his ex-wife, his now second baby mama.  That's not something I want to hear.  I don't need this unnecessary stress in my life when I can find a man with no children and no baby mamas.


She will not win.  


In person, I couldn't resist and still gave my guy a chance despite his situation.  I had the best two months of my life with him out of anyone I have ever known.  


Why did he move back to his old hometown?  Was it to protect me from him?  Or was it to give each other some space so I can concentrate on my own things?


I know it's to see his daughter more and he's not even with the first baby mama who is married to someone else.  I cannot stand seeing him do all this for a child and he is not even with the mother and the mother is married to someone else.  


Where does he have time for me?  He doesn't.  And I already knew that.  Since I'm so into him, I decided to give him a chance, anyway.


When he was in town, he was all I could think about...but now that I can't see him, and don't know when he'll be back, I can concentrate more on my work and finding a better job so we can have that good life I told him he would have with me.


I don't like that he deleted me from all of our social medias when we were fighting, but honestly, it's refreshing not seeing other girls trying to flirt with him on his page.  And I KNOW the only reason he's even trying to talk to other girls is because I'm having a hard time accepting his situation.  I am his first choice after his divorce.  And he is mine...but I can't stand the stress from his situation.


Once we talked more about being more exclusive, he's paid less attention to those other girls...at least I feel that he hasn't been talking to them as much anymore.


What is the reason for him moving an hour away?  Is it to make our situation even more complicated than it already is?  I have to put up with him spending most of his time with his kids and he's not even with either baby mama...and now he moves out of town.


What is the meaning of this?


And when I talked to his brother about us, his brother said he doesn't plan on moving back or anything.  He's not even trying to work things out with me.  He just wants to see his kid more.


My guy knows he fucked up his life.  He fucked up our future family because of stupid decisions he made when he was a teenager and he paid the ultimate price.  He apologized profusely for being a fuck up but that doesn't change the fact that he royally fucked up his own life and now when he finally meets someone decent like me, we can't be our own family because we still have to deal with his stupid fucking exes.


I see other people who willfully accept that guys have like three different baby mamas and they don't seem to care about the complications and how this situation affects the children.


I've tried dating other people, but I don't like anyone as much as I like my far, far away love.  I don't know what to do.


I keep telling myself to just do my own thing and if it's meant to work out with who I want, it will when it does.


He let me go find a man with no children because he could see how his situation was bringing the worst out of me.  I'm trying to accept it because I don't want his complications.  My entire life I purposely avoid people with complications like this, and yet, I find myself in the very middle of this situation I have never wanted to be a part of.


I can't stop thinking about him.


Signed,

Confused"
"Dear Diary,

I whine and complain about a lot of things but honestly. Honestly. It makes some decisions really easy. I love easy decisions. 

I have had such a peaceful week. No, the week itself wasn't peaceful but I feel peace.

I'm not used to it and I'm worried it's temporary. But I'm enjoying it so much. I haven't felt this way in ages.

"Dear Diary,

I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand.

When will I understand. How will I understand. Who can help me understand.

"I shut off the TV in my room, and just laid there. I could see out of the corner of my eye that the clock showed it was 3:32 AM. The rain hit the roof, and the bare branches of the tree scrapped against the side of the house. My mind thought of you, like it always does before I fall asleep. I saw you the other day, and it helped me feel alright inside. I texted you after I saw you about a work-related, kind of important (or at least I thought so) question. I waited for a response. And waited. And waited. I sent you another message again. Still nothing. I don't get it. How is it that you can act so great in person, but then if I send you something, I get nothing? What is it with you, T? How did I fall in love with someone who is such an enigma?"
"Dear Diary,

That was the whole point, wasn't it? For him to be happy?

So he's happy.

Maybe I'd be happy too if I started over somewhere else. How fun and exciting that must be.

I'm glad he has support of his family.

The truth is if we were still involved he would have gone anyway.

So I should stop crying while I listen to Break Even.

Stop wondering why.

Stop missing him.

Stop wishing.

"I just need to write, for the sake of writing because I don't know what else to do with these feels and thoughts, aches and pains.

I miss my long lost friend. Fucking miss her a lot. I keep dreaming about her. Sometimes tangible dreams I remember, sometimes the feint trace of something which leaves me feeling incomplete when I awake.

That incomplete feeling. It's difficult to ascertain exactly what causes it. Something between my experience, and the love of, from, and too this girl.

This would be so much easier to handle if I could just hear what she has to say, if anything. I could begin to move on.

This blind sided me on some idle afternoon in July. I knew I had to piece together a few things from my past, something that was left here so long ago. What I uncovered was a ten ton weight that I've been carrying with me for so long.

I lost my best friend here. The love and light of my life. My person. My really special someone. 

I keep trying to focus, to move things forward, but my thoughts just go back to her. 

Even now, sitting here, I just want to cry and die, be reborn, and go through it all over again until I find some peace over the topic.

Chances are, I'll never find her. Chances are she'll never come for me. Even if somehow I wandered my aimless way to her doorstep, she wouldn't even remember me or maybe just want nothing to do with me.

Chances are what chances are. 

I can't stop how I feel about her, but I can change and improve the impact it has on me.

I'm doing my best to get better, from this fucked up experience, and to move forward. I'm hoping something comes of this job search. I could really use the stability. Even if it's only to continue my search."
"Not real, but here's how I envisioned my engagement going:

We fly to London on November 3. Then visit my cousin in Ireland, who does chopper tours of England at bonfire night. We take the chopper from Shannon, landing at Antwerp, where I have the ring waiting for her on the tarmac. Yes, Antwerp airport (or any other) is not a particularly romantic place to get engaged, but I hope the rest of the night makes up for it.

"Most of the time I go through the day feeling nothing. No happiness. No sadness. Nothing at all.

I moved recently. For a job with better pay.

Got the job... Sort of. Not paying as much as was promised, but it's still more than I was being paid, and the weather here is much better than South Texas.


My boss is a pretty kick-ass dude. Swears like a sailor sometimes, and he just lets you be a person. He listens instead of tuning me out like everyone else... Which is a huge plus.

Still no girlfriend. Who would have guessed?

Still a virgin. At least I won't be 23 until next year.

There are a lot of really cute girls in this town though. I mean... Like, really cute, but there's one girl working at the (family owned) pizza place who just really stands out.

I think I smiled and laughed too much while talking to her though... I don't have the best of teeth. At least I didn't say anything tragically stupid.

I don't really like how dry my new toothpaste makes my mouth feel. I wish I could remember what it's called off the top of my head. But, it's one of those enamel(?) strengthening/protecting one's.

I really can't wait until I'm the only one in this house too. It seems like everyone is just taking turns saying shit just to take pot shots at me and/or pissing me off.

Also, I really wish people would stop bugging me about how little I eat. I only eat one meal a day, go to work, come home and then sleep. Stop nagging me. I'll eat when I'm hungry.

I wish I knew someone closer to my age though. I really want someone I can relate to. Also, I'd feel more comfortable establishing a relationship with someone not 10+ years older than me.

Maybe I'll meet someone when the tourist come through to go skiing and/or snowboarding up in the mountains. One can only hope.

I think I'll get pizza tomorrow. Actually, the calamari from there is amazing... Eh, the serving size is too small. If it wasn't so good I wouldn't spend $10 on it.

Yeah, I'll get pizza tomorrow.

Goodnight."
"I'm really trying to maintain a positive attitude today. A couple of instances have occurred where negative thoughts have crept into my brain, but I was able to stop myself and recognize they weren't rational and I didn't need to allow myself to go there. I consider that a win.

I applied for a job that is out of the norm for me, but it would involve helping others, which is something I found very satisfying in previous roles, and just my day to day life. I have always been told I'm a ""helper"". It may not the be the right fit for me, but it is worth a shot. You never know until you try. 

I'm looking forward to the weekend and spending it with the boyfriend. It should be fun, minus the necessary evils, such as grocery shopping, but to be positive, I'm looking forward to having a fridge full of groceries to make yummy meals. 

I really want to be more involved in making our meals. BF has always been the main contributor to this task, and while I always help him out and take care of cleaning up, etc, I know he would really appreciate if I took more initiative. Especially while I'm not working, it is the least I can do. 

I have been reflecting on things that make me feel better on a daily basis and one of those things is feeling gratitude, so I am going to try to focus on things that make me feel grateful, even if they are just little things. After all, I think the little things count for a lot. 

While I'm not looking forward to grocery shopping, I am grateful to have access to delicious and healthy food to fuel my body and mind. I am grateful to have a man I love who enjoys cooking for us and does an amazing job at it (seriously, I lucked out huge, he is an amazing cook). Most importantly, I am grateful for BF, who loves me despite all my flaws, appreciates the fact that I am trying to do better and get better and supports me in my time of need. I really am very lucky. While my situation may not be ideal at the moment, I can change it if I work at it and I could really be a lot worse off. Also, the sun is shining, I've got my music going and both of those things make me happy too!

I'm going to make today a great day! "
"I spent the afternoon working on a last-minute project that I'd received. Honestly I was of two minds about it when it came because it was something I wanted to do and yet I felt resentful. Not for the project itself but because I feel I don't have help or support.

Life has felt like a real uphill battle for me. I feel I need to work extra hard for the things I want and even then I may only get 10% of it. But when bad things come, it's like a mudslide that washes me back down that hill taking with it most (if not all) progress I've made. Then I've got to slog back up that hill again just to get back to the same place I was before I was swept down. And of course, I'm covered in dirt now.

I resent that. I resent that I have to work so bloody hard for what I want and at the slightest provocation all my hard effort could disappear in the blink of an eye. I resent that the people around me either can't or won't help.

Well, I finished the project and submitted it. Maybe my future self will thank me for not giving into the resentment. But right now, my present self is feeling that resentment burn against the back of my neck.

We'll see what tomorrow brings."
"Dear Reddit Diary,

Happy 17th birthday to my baby sister!  I can't believe you're 17!  How are you 17?!  I know we don't always get along and have our fights but you're still my sister!  I want you to be the best that you can be and succeed!  Not be so darn stubborn all the time!  As much as I don't like you sometimes, I'll always love and care about you!  We'll be in Europe in less than 3 months!  Disneyland!  Musicals in London!  And all the other stuff!  I will either just get you something there or just give you money.  I'll probably just give you money lol Happy birthday!  I love you!

Goodnight, Reddit Diary!"
"Dear Reddit Diary,

1.  I'm sorry I missed an entry.  It's just been a really busy week and I just forgot and lost track of time.  I also haven't haven't really been feeling well.

2.  So today is Mother's Day!  We honestly don't really celebrate it but I thought it would be nice to bring Mum out for a treat.  It was just us two.  Like I said, we don't really celebrate it so no one really knew it was today and no one wanted to go out.  Plus Mum wasn't expecting anything so she was happy.  We went to this small restaurant and had a small meal.  It was quite empty.  When we were almost done, the server brought us this chocolate lava cake.  Mum really loves this cake and it's one of her favourites but we didn't order it.  Turns out, it was on the house!  For all mothers!  So that was real nice of them!

3.  This is also Mum's first Mother's Day since grandma passed away.  She didn't really say much about that.  We did go to my other grandma's place.  We brought some pastries from a bakery we stopped by at.  She was happy we stopped by.  Grandma and grandpa don't get many visitors.

4.  The weather here has just been so terrible.  IT'S JUST SO HOT.  I really just want to strip all my clothing off 'cause they just get covered in sweat.  Sigh.  AT LEAST IT'S BEEN RAINING THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS.  Please don't be hot tomorrow!

5.  I saw my little cousins on Friday.  They were there for the day.  I saw them when I stopped over for our usual lunch.  I kinda made my baby cousin cry lol 'Cause I told her no.  lol ok

6.  Thursday was a public holiday.  I kinda forgot about that.  I knew it was coming but I didn't know when.  I mostly spent the day catching up on stuff.  Mostly sleep ahaha I also had a massage.  That was nice.

7.  Friday I had a meeting.  I also met with HR.  There were some things I wasn't very clear about and there seems to be something weird happening so HR said they'd check and will let me know this coming week.  I had a little spa treatment that night with Mum.  Just us two.

8.  Saturday I opened up a new bank account.  There are problems with my old bank so I want to get that settled before something happens.  Had dimsum with Mum, Dad and brother.  Sister was at school so we got her meal to go.

9.  Class has been fun so far.  Being tired sucks but it's only temporary.  It will all soon be over!

10.  Sorry this has been a jumble, Reddit Diary.  I really haven't been feeling well and my head is killing me so everything's all mixed up so I am gonna go to bed now.

Hope you've been well, Reddit Diary!  Goodnight!"
"Dear Diary

A few days ago i signed up for a job in beta testing games and I'm hoping that i can earn some sort of money. I have some schoolwork that i know i wont do and i think its about time i start fixing my procrastination and my other issues. I Considered getting other jobs but... Lets just say I'm not very good at interacting with other strangers.

We will see how things unfold in future, wish me luck for NAPLAN next week!

"Dear Reddit Diary,

1.  I'm just gonna keep this short because I wanna go to bed early.

2.  So I finished the project I was put on in March.  Tomorrow I will start a new one.  I've already been handed it and I have gone through like 1/3 of it.  It's not so bad but it does have a lot of problems so I will be pretty busy with it.

3.  I accidentally pinched my left index finger when I was trying to close the car window lol This was on Thursday and it still hurts and feels bruised now.  Sigh.  I don't know why I thought putting my finger there would be anything but bad!

4.  I have gotten better and more confident in trading.  For the coming week, I have a goal in mind of what I want to achieve.  

5.  I watched Captain America: Civil War on Saturday night!  Mum just got back like around 6 p.m from Kuching and we left like an hour later lol I LOVED IT.  SOON FOR X-MEN: APOCALYPSE!

6.  I have homework from my class but I forgot to do it so I'll just do it tomorrow lol

7.  I didn't go to the weekly family dinner.  I've just been real tired lately for some reason.

8.  Had a get together for my cousin's memorial.  It's 100 days today I believe.

9.  Game of Thrones tomorrow morning!  But I will have to wait till after I get back from work.  Sigh.

10.  I got a gift from my Cozy Toes Secret Santa!  Socks and a postcard!  A POSTCARD.  I love socks.  AND POSTCARDS.  THANK YOU, SANTA!  :D

Ok.  I'm ending here.  Goodnight, Reddit Diary!"
"Dear Reddit Diary,

1.  I am exhausted so I will keep this short.  I just got back from class and Diana wants to play.  

2.  Ok, firstly, Game of Thrones.  I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL.  I HAVE SO MANY EMOTIONS GOING ON AT ONCE THAT I HAVE NO IDEA HOW I FEEL.  Episode was really great!  I can't wait for the next one!  Since I couldn't stream it from work (booooooo), I just waited till I got home from work and just watched it straight away.  I was gonna watch the repeat that night but I had class.

3.  Did I mention I have class?  AND THIS TIME IT'S SO HARD.  Sigh.  It's ok!  I like a challenge!

4.  The new Hearthstone expansion is out!  I didn't pre-order it though.  I figured since I don't play all that seriously, I don't need to buy any of the packs.  I can just slowly get it and when it rotates out then it rotates out.  I'm not gonna obsess over getting a complete collection.  

5.  Diana's been sleeping with me since I barely get to see her lately.  I leave for work early morning and I stay at my sister's until I have to go to class.  So our bonding time has been her falling asleep on me, me falling asleep on her, her waking me up, me waking her up.  You get the idea.  It's just so adorable!  lol 

6.  I started playing this new game.  Disney's Kingdoms.  I was gonna start it sooner but I was worried I'd get addicted and lo and behold, of course I am addicted lol I NEED TO COLLECT EVERYONE.  I wonder why I don't feel the need to collect all the Hearthstone cards but I need to collect all the Disney characters lol

7.  Oh.  Mum's friends from KL, the couple we had dinner with, the were here today.  Mum had like a small get together with them.  She asked me to come along but I declined her offer.  It was gonna be a get together with a group of like senior citizens lol Oh, and she's going to Kuching on Friday.  She'll fly on Friday and be back on Saturday.  My great grand uncle passed away on Monday I believe.  Like early Monday morning.  So Mum and my aunt will be flying there to see the family.

Ok.  I think this will be all.  Goodnight, Reddit Diary!"
"Dear diary,


Today I got home after thinking about *her* all day, all week. For months. I did what I have been doing, checking to see if she made any attempt to get in touch with me. Nothing. I felt ill, I started to shake. Will I wait forever? I would. I've been trying so hard to learn from my mistakes and it's really making a difference, too. I would do *anything* for a small shred of acknowledgment from the one I love - but I don't yet know what that thing is, else I've had done it by now. I feel so helpless, hopeless, I am misunderstood and devastated. I feel exactly as she did everytime I ran from my discomfort in our problems. How I handled things was inexcusable.

&nbsp;

I knew I did that, I knew I avoided confrontation. There are times when cooling off is necessary but this was far beyond that. From cries for help, I took endless criticism, and, feeling defeated I'd shut it all out. I shut her out.

&nbsp;

It's one thing to know you messed up, and to honestly feel heartachingly sorry about it, but it's a whole other animal to suddenly realize it one day: As things get worse and worse and become literally unbearable you gain this clarity: ""*THIS* is what I did to her. *THIS* is how I made her feel"". We had problems easily surmountable turned into monsters by my insecurity.

&nbsp;

Mix it all in with the fact that your understanding of her will probably never matter and the guilt is unreal. I don't want to pick up, do this work learning how to be better and not do the same to someone else. I want to undo it with her. I want to undo and fix everything with her - the one.

&nbsp;

I now see you, I now feel you. I love you more than I ever have. You are so much stronger than I am."
"I feel like I haven't written in forever. I almost did last night, but I was too tired and opted for bed instead. 

Every week I am given a new piece of information about how shitty my husband is. Last night I put some thing together. Its torturous. I can't begin to work through any of this because I don't even know all of it. My husband is walking around lying to me and being angry with me and those how are telling me the truth. 

Every time I try to talk to him about something knew I find out he gets mad, walks away, comes back and makes me feel like shit and wants to know who ""told on him"". I am so floored. He stuck his dick in another woman. He went out with her, he spent time with her. He used my fucking money to take HER out! AND! It wasn't just her. 

I don't know how I am supposed to get over it. I don't know how I am supposed to forgive the lies, the continual lies. I don't know how I am supposed to work through it if I am not aloud to talk about it. I NEED to talk about it. I need to talk about it with BILL. He meets me with anger and rage at every turn. Knocking me back down to my small self and making me hurt so deeply and terribly. I feel so insignificant and unimportant. I do not feel loved. I have expressed that to him, that I don't feel love from him. He has nothing to say. 

I don't know how I am supposed to stay. I don't even want to. I just want to fucking die and stop feeling all this awful hurt. I want to be able to breathe for once in my life. 

I am still in counseling. It's still helping. I go once a week but it feels like it isn't enough. I am doing the homework, I am paying attention, but by the time I go back the next week I can feel that I have slipped backwards instead of forwards. 

I hate all of this. I am so so tired. I am so tired of hurting, of feeling like I am just dying inside all the time. I am so tired of not mattering. Not mattering to Bill. 

He got a job, he has to work today. Last night I made more connections, I know he saw her more than once and more than twice. I know there was likely a ""relationship"" between them. People talk in this little ass town, and even his friends, when they get drunk, slip up and say things that give me enough to make connections with what I have heard from others. 

This morning he asked me what was wrong. I know better than to fight with him before he goes to work, so I told him nothing. He said he could tell. I told him we could talk about it later and that I didn't want to ruin his day. (Pretty fucking stupid nice of me since he has ruined most of my days, including this one, for the last 13 years). He got mad, realizing it was about Skank, immediately wanted to know what I knew. I told him again, that we could talk about it later, like tomorrow, his day off. 

This pissed him off even more and he went on a rant about how everyone is telling on him,  no one is loyal, all his friends are betraying him, he can't trust any of them....

He fucking cheated on me. The one person who told me they truth was Rina and she is not his friend. Any extra info I have is cause he is stupid and careless himself, of his friends are stupid and careless and pass on more help than they realize. I don't fucking understand how he is mad at anyone. 

He openly fucking cheat on his wife. He let his friends and his family see what he was doing. He has humiliated me on every level and he is furious with me for knowing/finding out. 

WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH HIM??????

Ugh, I need to sit down and try to write some of this out to him. I can't get a word in when we talk cause he always interrupts me and talks over me until I just shut up. As I type this I feel stupid for still being in this. This is all so fucking gross. I feel so gross, I feel so unloved and hurt. He holds me there intentionally. Maybe he isn't fully aware of the intention, but he intends for me to be exactly where I am. Small and hurt and dying. 

"
"Typing in the dark is easier if I just look away for some reason.

I have something on my mind. The most painful thoughts seem to catch me when my head hits the pillow no matter how tired I am.

Bubs will die and I prolly will not know until it's too late.

It occurred to me. I imagined the whole scene. The ex and some friends or some new lover, their hidden annoyance or whatever when I show up. How I'd demand to see her. My precious dog.

I remember being against getting her. The timing wasn't right and etc. But I think deep down I can't let myself get attached. Yet I did.

I imagined her old and in failing health. Maybe even fully blind inside of just one eyed. My precious Sweetpea. I'd like to think she'd recognize me and that thought tears up heart open.

The ex, I deal with that. I let it ride just under unbearable till I can get some peace. The dog though. Ugh, I can never blame the dog. Even for a fart. She had some awful poots too. That's bulldogs though. Sloppy, stinky, and etc.. Though Bubs was a real princess.

I once had her on the leash and she walked away from me which was odd because she's so good at Heel. I realized it'd just rained and though I just across the grass she wanted to be on the dryer sidewalk. What a little priss.

I smile thinking back on that. Hell, any memory I had I smile about when it comes to that dog. Even when she ate half a branch and got constipated. She had the silliest face about it.

I loved a dog for the first time in almost 20 years. And though I know she's still kicking and chewing on her toys, she won't be some day. I'll miss that. I'll miss most of her life.

I had an adorable puppy come into my life. Me, the cynic and curmudgeon. The scrooge. The grinch. The buzzkill. She melted right through me.

It's painful, so very painful, to think about her passing. That I won't get to see her romp about with the grace of a linebacker. That I won't get to throw a ball for her. I miss her so damn much that it crushes me. Down to tears.

But she wasn't my dog. She was hers. She left and so did the dog.

I had a nightmare a long time ago, Bubs drowned and I had to hold her afterward.

Now I have these constant reminders that I won't get a chance to kiss her between the eyes and muss her face and just love on her. I keep thinking about her dying, sure it's years off, but something makes me think about it when I try to sleep sometimes.

Tonight was just a bit much.

Incidentally I realized the day with a mild sneer. Such a day and people will bring up one point or another. Pot, Hitler, Columbine. Whatever.

I just miss a dog.

I miss m'lil Sweetpea.

Love ya Bubs."
"I've been keeping track of days, not intentionally -never intentionally anymore- but math is easy so I knew today was coming about three days ago. It's subconscious, the math. Yet I knew of this day would be coming for a year. Some article I read said it was two months per year together. So, 14 months seemed right enough and lo' it became today.

You'd know, if you saw me, that I still ain't got it all together.

But today seemed tailor-made to remind me.

I watch Daredevil, the characters are good, season 2 is a little bloated with details but it's good. Fisk talks about his reclusive habits and I nod as a fellow introvert. It's good stuff.

Then Frank talks about how much he'd give to hurt, how his wife tore his heart out with a whim and he'd give anything to have that happen again. That odd feeling when you can pity the Punisher. Because I understand that. I really, really do. I never let people hurt me due to distance and simply not associating with hectic types of people.

Oh well things to do, hop in the car and flick on the radio. Commercial, boop the button... [""Pompatus of love..""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZo88P1Ie94&t=0m22s) Nope. Turned that off fast.

Sigh. Get chores done. Stop at a store. Walk out, grey Versa, like she used to drive parked next to mine. I brush it off, hers was silver, this ones grey, the Versa is a popular car. Let it go.

Drive. [Radio?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV1XWJN3nJo) **Nooooooo.** Time for Static X, that's on this playlist. Sure. Rob Zombie next? Sure. [Oh this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZmMD84XpCs) Radio off. Drive in silence.

Reach place less than intact, get a sandwich. Ignore the lake we picnicked at.

Drive home, much later. In the dark. Feel like maybe I should just endure. Maybe I should stew. Let's let the radio decide. [Oh.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSYV-JmrGpw) Ah, so clear, a house, a porch. Sunlight.

I realized that, considering how many game worlds I'm memorized and other things, my memory is peculiar. I can tell you what was going on pretty easily. I can see who was there, except DD because he's without personal presence, what the mood was. I can see so many details.

But words never stick. Numbers do for some reason.

14 months to let go, maybe I have. I didn't breakdown. I kind of felt bad somewhere inside for not doing it. Maybe this could be my last emotional hoo-rah. Whatever.

I guess. It's far too late for anything magical to happen in my life. I guess I gotta get comfortable with that."
"The alone counseling session went... emotional. He told me because of being beaten by my dad as a child I had lost my free will. My dad beat his will in me from the time I started walking. Now I have carried that into adulthood and I can't leave Bill because I have no will power. I learned a ton of other stuff. He put a huge emphasis on building a case to me that I am in an abusive relationship. He asked to see me alone. Said my head is fucked up and I need to get it right. Not so oddly I often say that my head is fucked up. 

Much like today. 

Last night Bill admitted to sleeping with Skank. I knew he had. I would have been stupid to have believed him all the times he told me he hadn't. A few nights I screamed at him, ""Liar! Liar!"" because I KNEW and I was sick of it. 

He took on a sad look before he told me. I asked him what was wrong. I told him he looked sad. He wouldn't look at me. He said ""I don't know"" and ""nothing"" to my multiple inquiries of what was wrong. 

As I looked at him I knew, I knew he was about to drop a bomb on me, I knew it would be about Skank. I knew. I braced myself for it and in my head told myself, ""You already know, you know already, its going to be ok."" Then he said it. 

""I don't want to lie to you anymore. I slept with her.""

I felt it wash over me. I braced and held on, I already knew. It didn't help, the admission of it was just as bad as if I hadn't known. Worse because he spent weeks lying to me about it and making me feel bad for thinking he had done something. But, there it was, he slept with her. I looked at him and said, ""I know.""

He is sorry. I have never seen him be sorry for anything. He takes full responsibility for it. He has said sorry a thousand times between now and yesterday. I believe that he is. 

He didn't use a condom. (shakes head)

I lived through that once. Him getting someone else pregnant. I won't again. I can't do it. I know it isn't in me. Especially not her. 

I have to go get checked now. I shared my husband with another woman. He didn't even give me the option to not sleep with him. Just kept silent. 

It different this time. I have been cheated on for years and years. I know it well. Being married to him makes it different.  It runs deeper. It's more painful. Not sharp, but dull and deep, the kind that makes your whole body ache. 

I can't look at him. When I do I want to cry. I want to cry anyway. Looking at him makes me want to worse though. The hurt is so vivid and loud in my head. I hate being visual. I didn't have to see it to know what it looked like. I hate the pictures... fuck. 

- bong rip -

Bill got those meds awhile back, the ones for anxiety. He gave me three last night so I could stop shaking, another an hour later to try to bring on sleep. Two more this afternoon to stop the stupid leaky tears while I work. I hate them. 

They keep you from crying, or letting your feelings be expressed outwardly, but they don't kill the deep ache inside. You get to feel it raw and unwavering, but you can't find relief in tears. 

I have wished for death. I am so tired of living this life of pain and hurt and disappointment. I have never met a person that wouldn't stab me in the back. Not one. All the people I know (kids as the exception) have stabbed in the back, most more than once. 

I hate my life. I hate all the pain. I am tired of walking around shattered, I am tired of the death to my soul. 

End this. "
"Time to write is scarce, and I miss it. 

There is so much to say before I run out of time, I don't know where to start. 

I went out with a friend I haven't seen in 14 years a couple Fridays ago. We went to a bar. I don't go to bars, I didn't really understand what they were for until the other night when I went. 

We walked in and I followed her to the pool tables, I have never played pool, but she was excellent. As soon as we got to the tables there was a herd of men and boys, surrounding us. Like a flock, they all reaked of booze and half of them couldn't even stand straight. Everyone wanted to know our names. I wore my wedding ring and told any man that spoke to me that I was married, determined to be good. 

Most wondered off after they saw the ring. One wouldn't move on, M. He was so so good looking. Exactly my type, and still sober. He carried intelligent conversation, he asked questions about me. He probably learned more about me that night than Bill has ever learned. At one point he took my hand, I pulled back, but it took me a few seconds. I felt instant guilt for it. 

We all went to a party after the bar closed. He was there, he begged me to crawl into a recliner with him and sit. I didn't. My friend decided to go home with a guy she met. I drove them to the house they were going to be staying at. M was there. He came out because I wouldn't go in. He didn't understand, I told him I was married over and over. In the end I told him it wasn't because I didn't want to, but because I choose not to. 

One night of easy sex for him could me destruction to my kids lives, mine and Bill's and possibly others. There are consequences for cheating. I know them well as it has been done to me for years. And I know Bill would not with stand a blow like that. 

I pulled into my driveway proud of myself for resisting temptation, I walked inside and Bill was pissed. He was sure I had slept with someone. Accused me of being drunk even though I had switched to water at midnight knowing that I was driving. I was sober. 

He refused to speak to me the rest of the night and called me a liar more than once. The next day was more of the same. I was hurt, I was good. I didn't want to be good in the end and I still made a choice to do the right thing, and even with all that he was mad at me. 

I told him that I choose him, I continue to choose him. I made a conscious choice that night. I told him that I can choose someone else, cause I can, I can choose others. And that instead of being furious with me for choosing him he should be grateful. I know I would have been grateful if he had chosen me through all those years. He told me he believed me and it wasn't talked about again until counseling. 

Days later a guy that I know came to the house. He is insane, like actually. He is also a really good friend of mines SO. He has a tendency to drink too much and he just can't keep things straight in his head, also he is a pathological liar. I am just surrounded by people like this. I have known this couple for almost 10 years now. 

Bill is not friends with him and they both know that he is not welcome at my house, I don't have time for his crazy anymore. He showed up, Bill hid it from me, when I found out he insisted I stay inside and that he would get rid of him. 

I can think of so so many times when he has said that he would handle something and then hours later it still won't be done. I gave him 5 minutes and walked out. Of course the guy was still here. I asked him if he just didn't understand what ""not welcome"" meant, as I have told him multiple times that he is not welcome here. He mumbled and stuttered and then said I should have told him. Have I mentioned I have had to have this conversation with him multiple times?

He left, Bill was mad, and so was I. That guy has nearly killed my friend with his bare hands in front of me, he hurt me when I tried to interfere and he hurt his son. I am founded on my reasons for him not being here and I feel that it is disrespectful of Bill to 1. hide him being here, 2. Not make him go the second he shows up. 

He was mad at me because he ""really was going to do it, was getting to it just as I came out"". But really they were lighting up cigs and having a smoke. Bill knows if he wants to be friends with that guy he can. But that guy can't be at my house. 

Day after that Bill blamed me for him not having friends. He killed his own facebook, he shut his phone off for months and refused to take even his families calls. As soon as we were seperated it all changed, The day he moved back in he reverted back to that. I have no influence on this. I hate it, I feel like he does that to hide because he is ashamed of being with me. He has spread massive amounts of nasty about me. Everyone he knows hates me, even though most have never met me, let alone had a conversation  with me, because he lies about me. And he never rectified any of the things he said. It is not my fault he chooses to have no friends. That is his fault and its hurts me that I am still not included in his life, and now, I am being blamed for it. 

All of those things were talked about in counseling. The only opinion the counselor had after hearing the story about the guy was that it was disrespectful of me to not let Bill handle the situation. He said this not knowing the guys history, or his history with me, or knowing that he had been told multiple times. He then proceeded to ""show"" Bill how to talk to me, he was super harsh about it, telling me I was disrespectful and cussing at me. After he finished I said I appreciated his honesty. Cause I did. I didn't defend myself and help him understand the whole situation. I was wounded.

The rest was nothing special, at the end the counselor asked if we had anything else we wanted to talk about. I said no, Bill said, ""I think she is still mad about me messing around her in the past"" i felt a lump immediately form in the back of my throat. I didn't want to talk about the past, the other women that day. I had already been beat up on enough. The counselor said, ""I think she is, too."" And tears started leaking down my stupid face. I was so freaking mad at myself. The counselor than asked if I would be willing to meet with him one on one. I said yes. he said ""I want to say somethings to you that would be easier said if he wasn't here."" I just said ok and continued to try and stop the tears and regain some control. 

As soon as we got to the car Bill exploded, I didn't expect it, I was still crying... still obviously hurting. He yelled at me for the 20 minute ride home because I can't get over the past, because the counselor costs 50 bucks a time (dude still doesn't have a fucking job), cause this next session I go alone and the counselor is going to tell me to leave him. 

When we got home he grabbed the keys to the truck and walked for the door asking as he went past me if I wanted him to leave. I fucking hate it when he does this. He is cruel and awful to me and then he wants to leave. And if I say yes to his question I am a dick. Just, wtf, stop being a piece of shit and own your shit. He acts like I ENJOY walking around hurting all the time. Like, this must be fucking fun to walk around will a hole in my chest knowing my husband like to fuck other women. Knowing that for at least 7 years of our relationship I wasn't the only one. Yes lots and lots of fucking FUN FUN FUN!

[Bong rip]

This week, including the last couple days he has been like a 15 year old kid, this is a Bill I know well. Always has his hand out for my money, my car keys, my body. I feel most unloved and most used during these times. I work my ass off, he spends all my money because he is irresponsible and ""needs"" things. He drives my car cause its the nicest and I'm not driving it when I am working, he sits around playing xbox cause he doesn't have a job, and he likes to have sex when I am super busy, like a child begging for his mothers attention, and he is lazy in bed. Just lays there and has me do it all. Its fucking disgusting that I am participating in this. 

It's not even noon here and already he has cost me more than 100 bucks. I make minimum wage, I work 2 jobs, on the verge of being hired for a 3rd, I run two stores online and a photography business in addition to the jobs. I work, all the time. He spends it. When he isn't around I have thousands in the bank, savings accounts grow. When he is here all my funds are depleted. I emptied my savings last week. ITs even worse cause when he comes to me with his hand out he says in a baby voice ""I know I'm so spensives babes"" and then asks me for money. 

Ugh, I'm not selfish, but damn! I'm not buying myself anything, I pay bills and pay for what ever the boys need. I do not shop for myself. 

I feel... I don't know. Used, used up and used. I feel unloved, and miserable. 

I miss a life that exists only in my dreams and I don't even know what it looks like anymore. "
"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXGCgg3JzZs](This) song has been on repeat in my head for days. I don't know why. I feel so drained.

 Today I spent all day in a big city several hours from home. Meetings for work. I hate my job. My MIL is my immediate boss. She is a liar. She manipulates everything. She is failing at her job daily, and I save her. My new position means her boss is now my boss, it means that I know every fucked up thing she does. It means that I am getting to see how truly inadequate she is in her position. I had to save her today and lead the meeting for HER team. The team I am on. JT (our boss) was there to sit in. We are supposed to have these meeting once a month. I have been with this company for two years and the 1st I heard of these MANDATORY team meetings was a week ago. 

I walked in as clueless as she was on what we were supposed to do. The kicker? She had been to one the day before yesterday, and she STILL couldn't present the necessary information (that is written on paper in front of her!) to her team of employees. 

She passed that shit to me. So I did it. I presented. JT saw the whole thing and it was clear he is not pleased. He kept MIL and I late after the meeting (who cares about my 2 and a half hour drive home). It felt like a waste of time, I didn't learn anything that I haven't already learned. I just clocked hours. Which, I guess, is fine. 

Bill and I went to counseling yesterday. It was rough considering the events of the past two weeks. I told all, last time I let him bash me the whole time, I watched the counselor be super sympathetic to Bill and his plight. I wasn't even mad, I was glad he got Bill talking, I was glad that he was at least expressing something. 

But, this time it was my turn. I told about Skank. I told about Esky. He asked me why I stay, ""Cause I love him!"" I cried through my tears. He wouldn't accept it. As we talked, as he asked me questions I realized that I say because I am afraid. I am afraid to be with out him. I already know that there is a massive co-dependancy happening. I didn't realize how scared I am to not be with him. 

I can be with out him. I have been for Christsakes. I have spent years with out him. I fear the day that he stops wanting me. Even when we are apart we talk. He may be a massive piece of shit, and he freaking is, but, he is all I know. 

I went from an abusive, deeply religious, massively oppressed, super sheltered life at home with my family to Bill. The bad with Bill started the week we got together. It was never good. In the beginning I stayed because I had know where else to go but home. No one could have put me back there. Even now...

Now? I am here because I don't know how to do anything else. I want to make it work with him. We are stuck in the drama triangle. Both of us. 

The problem is Bill still doesn't think there is a problem, still doesn't think there was one. I am over here working, learning, opening myself to improve whatever needs to be improved, and he is walking around acting like there isn't a problem at all. 

No school tomorrow for the boys. Good Friday. MIL offered to take them to the movies since I am going to be busy doing her clerical work. (Wasn't that nice of her). It's out of character for her to want to be a Grandma, for her to want to spend time with the boys. It's super rare for me to get desperate enough to ask her to baby sit, I have asked maybe 4 times in the last 12 years. 

She said yes once. I left my 6 week old baby with her for 4 hours. When I returned I found my son in a poopy diaper that ""He shit in as soon as you left, I don't do poop so I waited for you to get back"". Seriously, that's what she said. She never said yes again. I avoided asking her unless there was an emergency I couldn't avoid. 

She failed so miserably as a mother. She is still failing as a mother. Daily. I shouldn't judge, I'm no prize. I am just so blown away. My boys own their shit. If they did it they must own it, they must be honest. The punishment is less if they do, more if they are caught in a lie or avoiding responsibility. 

MIL and I spoke extensively about Bill's sister, Lee. Something is truly wrong with her, I believe she was diagnosed bi-polar. Meds have changed nothing, though, and I know a few bi-polar individuals, and none compare to Lee. She is truly out of her mind. MIL mentioned her poor behavior, and I agreed. Immediately MIL made excuses for her behavior, blaming it on Lee's ex mother-in-law for ""taking credit for buying popcorn at the circus last month when she bought none""... yeah. that makes no sense to me either. 

I cut her short, I know how this goes, poor Lee, so many other people have just screwed her up. I told MIL that it was bullshit. When were still but teenagers, I was seven months pregnant with The Kid. she attacked me for telling a truth that she had spoken to me, I named her as giving me info. 

She came at me with her nails to my face, I fought back, huge belly and all, I was on top of her and she planted both of her feet into my stomach and kicked me so hard she slid me across the floor. I escaped to the bathroom to find that I was bleeding and had to go the hospital. The Kid's heart beat was low but the bleeding stopped. I was sent home around 2 am. When I got there I discovered a party in full swing, Lee at the center of it all bragging about how she had kicked my ass. Even at 16 Lee was insane. Bill joined that party and left me in our room alone to hurt. No one did anything. Not even I.

MIL acted as if she had no idea that this had happened. I sat in disbelief. A month after she had kicked me I was given an emergency c-section, my son, The Kid, was born blue and not breathing. 

I blame her. I don't know if she caused it, but I am healthy and strong. My body is a good body, back then it was stellar. I have always blamed her. 

MIL, making excuses for her children, her children failing in life because they have never had to take responsibility for ANYTHING. J, Bill, or T go to jail: Momma's got ya, bail, lawyer, and a great cover up story. I could list thousands of things and how she has saved them and how she continues to, but its nauseating and I don't have the time. 

I am saving Bill. I don't make excuses for him. I want him to own his shit and the fact that he doesn't infuriates me. I save him because I won't stop enabling him to treat me like trash. I'm learning about myself. I always let him come back. If he uses a woman against me I cave in a second and bring him home. It is so weak of me. I fail so hard at this. 

UGH... Learning, learning as I write... I am fucking weak. In counseling I said that Bill was weak cause he couldn't keep his shit together if I wasn't there to be the glue and do it for him. 

I stand by that. He is fucking weak. But now I see, that so am I ...

For some reason I feel ashamed of that. 

"
"Sometimes, we get so engrossed by the darkness around us that we can't see any light. We feel all alone, even though we can hear whispers all around us. Eventually, we get tired of the emptiness and we let go. 

I wish that I could let go. I know that people care for me and that I am loved. I wish I were the kind of person who could be selfish enough to just let go. Being here in China grows increasingly difficult day by day. I have so many people who care for me, even here. I don't know why I feel so alone. I have so many friends and I do things with people a lot, to keep myself busy.

I can't maintain happiness. I can't hold on to it. I can't produce happiness from within. My happiness comes from those around me and right now, I feel isolated, even though I'm not. Happiness currently lasts a couple hours before it just disappears. I'm on medication. It had been working. I don't understand what's wrong with me. I just can't be happy.

I've been drawing. I thought maybe drawing would do something for me. All it did was distract me temporarily from my thoughts. I felt nothing. No joy. No pride. Nothing. The fact that something I used to love so much literally does nothing for me emotionally makes me feel so awful. I loved drawing. I loved making art. What happened to me? How did all this happen? 

I sang yesterday with my friend. It helped burn off some of my anger that I've been feeling. I was abandoned by two of the people I would do anything for. Why wouldn't I feel angry? You'd think after a few months of separation, things would be better. But they're not. 

Negative emotions rule my life. Everyone tells me that I have to just be happy or that I choose to feel this way. I get so frustrated with those people. It ultimately has nothing to do with the things that have happened to me. My brain doesn't produce enough Alpha waves and produces too many Beta waves, meaning, I can't relax. I also have a chemical imbalance in my brain; it doesn't produce enough of the happy chemicals. So it really upsets me when people tell me I need to choose to be happy or learn to be happy---because I'm doing everything in the formula. I'm forcing myself to be around people, I'm eating delicious food, I get plenty of sleep, I do things that I used to feel so much joy in doing, I try to relax by reading or watching something on TV every single friggin day. I am in therapy. I am on drugs. I'm doing the things. So why aren't they working?

I'm getting tired of being in the dark. It's lonesome here."
"This will likely be cut short. But I have to get shit out.

Yesterday as I sat on my 4th conference call I read messages from Bill's sister in law. She told me about Bill and Skank. More nights that I didn't know about. More things that I didn't know. More things that didn't line up with what he had told me. 

Dammit. I always find out. I told him I would find out. Of course it went the same as it always does. 

It's not his fault. It's my fault. He doesn't say sorry until I finally ask how he could not be sorry. 

Why. The. Fuck. Are. We. Doing. This?

Counseling tomorrow. I find myself not even wanting to go. This shit is out of control. Enough dwelling. It's out. It's fucked. It's a disaster. 

I had a shoot a couple days ago. I have missed working with people. I have missed being behind the camera. It was good for me. The pictures are turning out beautifully as well. 

After finding out all of the above nasty I went to MB's last night. I needed to escape. She loves me fiercely. She's fuckin crazy, but for some reason she has always been super loyal. I hadn't seen her in years. It was good. She always builds me up. I needed it.

Likely it was a bad idea though. Cause now she is messaging me. I stopped hanging around cause of the hostility in her house. She is always fighting with her daughters or her man. It's always drama and it's bad for me. But I missed her. We shared a bowl of green while I unloaded about my asshole of a husband. And then we shared another bowl while she unloaded about hers. 

Same shit different day... year. Ugh... fuck my life. 

I'm at the dentist right now. Not for my snazzy pearly whites, thank goodness. Bills sister-in-law needed a ride. She needs a name. Rina. She's just a kid. Just had Bills brothers baby. I like her. 

She's the only other person wrapped up in this family with a shred of integrity. At least someone has the balls to be honest with me. I feel bad for her. I felt bad for her when she got with J. Even worse when she got pregnant. J is no better than Bill. Or he wasnt. But I have seen evolution in him. He is good to Rina. I'm happy for her. She's a good kid. 

After this I have to take her the 45 min drive home and then turn around and drive the 45 min back to have dinner with a wedding client... I think I'm too busy maybe. 

I feel pressure. I miss having time to breathe, time to relax, having a quiet phone. I miss silence. 

After silence, that which expresses the inexpressible is music. Thank God for music."
I can't take it anymore. I'm done with everything. I am overwhelmed. I can't take my ex's drama anymore. Everything that's going on in his life is spilling over into mine even though we don't talk. I need to move. I need to get out of here. I need to get away from life here. I can't do this anymore. I can't keep life the way it is. I can't handle anymore. I'm about to quit life.
"Really, I'm too tired to write, its after 1 am. But I have been waiting all day for an opportunity. Bill is asleep. I managed to find a place for all three boys tonight. I had hoped he would take me out. I work my ass off all week to pay for the lives we live and he literally sits on the catch watching youtube videos about the earth being flat and Russia. 

While I showered and did my hair I had quiet moments to myself to reflect. It occurred to me... When I asked how long it had been since he talked to Esky he told me that it had been weeks before we got back together. Last time Esky was involved she continued to text him for months after she new we were back together. So that story was believable. But I have a message in my phone from her, from that night when I found out he had been talking to her. ""I knew he was married, but he told me the divorce papers had been signed.""  How the fuck could she possibly know that? If he hasn't talked to her in week ssince before he and I got back together then how the fuck did she know we had signed papers?

Because he was still fucking talking to her. And then I wondered if there was more truth about Skank that I haven't pieced together yet.

After I dropped off all the boys to there friends places I asked him about Esky, I wanted to know how she could know that. At first he tried to tell me she must have guessed. I didn't buy it, I then got the typical ""I don't know"" response. I told him I would let him think about it and he could get back to me and that I don't know just wasn't going to work. He then said he didn't remember talking to her and that he must have been drunk. 

TIMELINE: Thursday, signed divorce papers(didn't file them as we agreed), Friday morning, 7am, I find his car at Skank's place. Friday night he comes over and hasn't left. 

He had less than 24 hours and in that span he was talking to two different women. Ugh. Gross. 

He accused me of getting a sitter for all the boys so I could fight with him. That is absurd. I spent all week planning this night off. I asked him to plan something to do for us since I was handling the childcare. Yes, Bill, I spent all week finding a sitters so I could fight with you. That shit didn't even hit me until I was in the shower!! ABSURD!

He blamed me for his actions. He did everything but own his shit and say sorry. The two things I needed him to do. I sat in my office after the confrontation, hurting, loading my 1st bowl of the day. He said from the other room ""Soooo.... are you just going to ruin our night?"" 

""What?"" I said.

He immediately realized his phrasing was fucking stupid and tried to correct himself and said ""are we just going to sit here and be miserable?"" At least make it rhyme!!

I can't even remember what I said, something about how he should apologize for hurting me an lying to me and stop being a dick about it all. 

Silence... 

He came in and half hugged me and said he was sorry. I hate it. It didn't feel genuine, it never does... Probably because I have to tell him to do it every fucking time, indicating that he actually isn't sorry at all. Or is too emotionally retarded to feel remorse...

We got in the car, drove 45 minutes to a restaurant, I shed silent tears most of the way. I don't even know why. I have cried enough... I just feel so... replaceable. 

Dinner, driving home, getting a gun shooting it a few times and then home for some Halo swat on XBOX. That was our night...

I don't mean to be ungrateful... I paid for the whole damn thing anyway, but, I don't understand why he won't take me out. He went to the bars with Skank. I have seen pictures of them at bars, dancing, grinding... I have seen pictures of him with Esky at bars in her town. I know he went with K regularily, the 1st one he cheated on me with... and My big titted friend that he fucked, my only friend, went with her too. 

Dancing, drinking, drugs, laughter. I was left out of all of it. I had to stay home and raise our kids while he went out and dipped his dick in what ever nasty would have him, drank himself stupid, and snorted meth. I'm not saying I wanted that life. 

For fucks sake I am 30 years old and I have done nothing! I have never been to a party. I have been to bars maybe 5 times in m LIFE. MY dad kept me under his thumb and I didn't get much life experience as a home-schooled kid that lived in the middle of nowhere with no TV or radio. 

When I escaped that I landed with Bill inside of 2 months, 3 months later I was pregnant with The Kid. I stayed all grown up and he continued to act like a 15 year old kid. I resent him for it. 

I resent him fr going out to the bars just weeks ago with Skank but not with me tonight. Shooting six bullets out of a hand gun in the freezing cold really isn't that fun... even for a country girl. I just don't understand why I am excluded. 

I expressed that to him as we were on the way home, he said it was because when its just him he doesn't give a fuck about what happens to him, he doesn't car if he goes to jail or gets in a wreck, but with me he cares. Sounds sweet right? Yeah... except, his going to jail or having an accident in one of my vehicles would effect me. I would have to bond him out of jail, hire a lawyer, and pay his fines. An accident would mean taking care of an injured person, if it was bad it would mean long nights in the hospital and months in rehab, taking him home and reteaching him how to eat and speak and write and read... I have done that before. If it was worse I would be planning a funeral... 

What he said is bullshit. It was an excuse and an avoidance of the truth. I'm not aloud at his friends' houses either. He's talked too much shit on me. As Esky said, ""He made you look like a horrible person."" And I know she isn't the only one he painted me that way too. I had more people still talking to me then he realized. This is a small area. People tell. 

I just fucking want to give up. I want to pack my kids, pack my shit, tell my boss/MIL to fuck off, and move the fuck away. I want to start over, to escape all of this. 

I am so fucked up. My head is a fucking mess. At least I know it, right? 

I can't leave though, I love this town, I love the school, my kids are deep into this tiny, tight nit, hard to break into community. I love my river. I love my house, my house that is nearly paid off. This place is home. I can't go. But.. FUCK. I want to. 

This came out differently than I drafted it in my head. My heart is so raw. My soul feels dead deep within my gut. My eyes burn and I walk around with a constant lump in my throat. He is oblivious... Utterly oblivious to all of it. Some one just come and end this. 

"
"Dear Diary,

Life is so stressful right now. I guess it always is, unless it isn't. I don't get to have an in-between option. It's either completely stressful or completely laid-back.

Ex Boyfriend quit church and that's caused a huge stir because he was raised inside of my church. And now like, a lot of people from church are trying to use me to get him to come back to church but I'm just kind of like....we broke up for a reason. Can't really use me. I told them just to give him some time and space and, if it's in God's will, he'll come back to the church.

Granted, I don't believe that my church is the one true church and I don't even know if I am Christian. I think I've talked about that before. It's too complicated to even think about that right now. Too many other things going on.

Ex Boyfriend's mother has disowned Exboyfriend. Unfortunate. Then she reminded me today, I kid you not, that I am still one of her children and that I am welcome to stay with her so that I can focus on school and that I wouldn't have to pay for room or board or utilities. I am seriously flattered by the offer, but how would that make my ex feel? ""Yeah hey, so Stranded is living with me now and she's your ex, but she's more of a daughter to me than you are son."" Awkward.

I'm thinking about up and moving to Australia for school. I don't particularly want to get into more debt, but I don't know that I want to deal with all the drama that goes along with living back home---either with my mom (I'd have to add family drama on top of everything else) or with ex's mom.

I don't feel particularly safe in the US anyway. Here in China, I can walk around the streets at night without worry about being jumped or kidnapped or raped. I go back to the States and there is zero chance I'll even feel comfortable walking across a parking lot at night. I am going to miss China for that reason. But I can't stay here. My ex is here and I don't want to deal with that. Everything here reminds me of him. I am miserable. I am so miserable.

Crocface update: I have decided that I am not in a good place to be able to be in a relationship to begin with. I just had a nasty breakup and there's all sorts of pressure being put on me from church and my family and the ex's family for half a dozen different reasons. So I am putting my crush on him on the backburner for now. I have too many other things going on right now to deal with the prospect of a relationship. I get the feeling that he and I are on the same page. Never mind the whole being on separate continents bit. I'm lonely. Not gonna lie. I'm super lonely. So it was nice talking to him everyday. But, I need to kind of step back so I don't end up falling in love with him. That would be unfortunate. I fall hard and fast. I get fascinated with someone and until I am outright rejected, it doesn't go away. And when I suggested he rejected me a while back, he said that he didn't say that---but that he didn't think things would work. So we'll see. But for now, no focus on that. I need to focus on school and getting my taxes done and filed and fafsa filled out and bills paid and stuff and things. So much going on. Ugh. Oh well.

"I have itchy fingers this morning. I don't know why. I have a stupid training call in less than half an hour. I HATE this job. 

Bill is still here. We aren't talking about Esky or Skank. Occasionally in passing conversation I will be reminded about them and say something shitty about it. Most times he doesn't even acknowledge the things I say. I am trying to bite my tongue about it. Its just all so fresh and I am pretending it didn't happen. 

I don't want to even talk about it. 

The concert The Kid and I went was awesome. He's so quiet, it was hard for me to tell if he was enjoying himself, but towards the end I saw him swaying and clapping. I bought him a $4 piece of pizza, a $6 cup of dipping dots, and both of us got waters for $3.50 a piece. Shit is freaking ridiculous expensive! 

We got shirts, too. There were 10 different artists, so we both got to pick out favorite. It was a good time for both of us. I miss it being just me and him sometimes. That Kid was my best friend for several years. Sometimes he still is. I have good kids. The Kid is a good kid. 

I'm grateful for that. 

I have been thinking about visiting an old friend of mine. She... man, I know she is bad for me. MB, she loves me fiercely and would take anyone on for me. She has always had my back, but, she will use the shit out of me. I miss her. Her house always smells of piss and shit, the result of her autistic daughter and too many animals. Its awful. But I miss the bonfires, I miss laughing over joints, I miss the way she built me up. Even when all the shit was wrecking my life, much like now, she had me feeling like a fucking queen... She is bad for me though. 

Eight minutes until this stupid call. Ugh! I dread this shit. My boss is a really nice guy, but I don't have a million hours of my life to listen to him chat. I don't get paid enough. 

Also I work another job, run two online stores and a Photography business. All of which he knows about... If he keeps me too long on a call and I go over my 30 hours for the week my immediate manager comes in and REMOVES hours from my check. I just found that out last week. Why do I tolerate it...? Mother In Law is my manager. Bill muzzles me... I am weak. 

And that's my phone... he's four min early. UGH
"
"Today I go to my 1st concert ever. I'm taking The Kid. We are going with our ""friends"". 

I say that because they both, mother and son, consider us good friends. She calls me her bestie even. I don't consider her my best friend though. She is pretty obnoxious to be honest. 

I have never had a best friend. I've never been that close to someone. I don't know how.. and I think the term bestie is childish...

This morning in the shower as I got ready I had time alone to think. To feel all the feels about Esky and Skank. I'm not gonna lie. I'm hurting pretty awful.

Bill came in and told me he loved me. Hugged me. I looked at him and asked if he loved only me. He said yes and held me.

Tears slid down my cheeks. God it fucking hurts. I considered doing it again. Asking him to go. I considered taking the signed divorce papers and filing them at the court house. I considered never going to counseling again and saying fuck all of this shit. Cause seriously, this is not normal. 

It's torture. I shared a post of Facebook today: ""I will not live the same year over and over for 90 years and call it life"". I am doing that. I am living the same shit over and over again. 

I don't want to do that. I want things to be better. I want it to be different. I want to be fucking happy for once in my life. I have been crying out to God, the powers that be, ""pull me out!!"" I am so desperate to be free of this awful. I am so desperate to feel this weight come off. 

I am so tired of hurting. I am so tired of Bill not caring/not knowing how to react to the horrific pain he is causing me. 

Ugh. This day is just dark. The sun is shining out, but inside I feel cloudy, moody, distant inside. I feel sad and dead inside. I don't know how long it's going to last. 

I  thinking about going to the doc and asking for something for anxiety. I do OK with my weed. But those shock nights, when I get slammed with something terrible, I need more than my reg weed. Everyone I go to the doc though, he tries to put me on anti-depressants. That's shit turns me into a loony bitch, I'm not afraid to admit it. 

This road trip/concert is not what I want to do today. I just want to crawl in bed and hide from the world."
"Dear Reddit Diary,

1.  Well, I'm sick lol The weather's been pretty bad here lately and I haven't really been sleeping or eating well so I guess my body finally took its toll and decided to crash.  I might take a sick day tomorrow.  We'll see how I'm feeling.  Maybe I will take two!

2.  Class on Thursday night was cancelled.  The teacher was stuck in a trafiic jam because of a real bad accident so we were told if he didn't arrive in half an hour then we should all just leave.  So I went to my late grandparents' house.  I haven't been there in a few weeks because of class so I kinda missed the big family dinners.  Before I left to go there, I was trying to call Mum to confirm with the teacher about the class because I didn't have his number.  I texted Mum.  No answer.  Called her.  No answer.  Called Dad.  No answer.  Called my brother.  He picked up but I forgot he was in the city so that was a bit pointless lol I then decided to call my late grandparents' house.  I'm kinda proud I still remember their landline!  So I called and someone picked up.  I didn't recognize the voice at all.  It turns it out was Mum!  I didn't tell her I didn't recognize it was her though ahaha When I got there, she said she didn't recognize my voice either!  She said I sounded like a child!  Well, ok lol I have the physique and voice of a child.  This means I can get discounts right??

3.   I saw Kungfu Panda 3 on Friday night!  It was awesome!  I went with Mum, brother and youngest sister.  It was a spur of the moment thing.  We don't usually do things spontaneously but we all were looking forward to this so after my brother got home, we went out after dinner.  My youngest sister wanted to do her homework first so we caught a later show.  I had a few teary moments.  THE ANIMATION IS JUST SO BEAUTIFUL.

4.  Saturday I was mostly at my sister's house.  I was taking advantage of the super fast internet.  So I became my youngest sister's chauffeur.  Picking her up from school and sending her to her class.  I also went to the bank to help drop something off for Mum and Dad.  They were in the city at my uncle's funeral.  He's Mum's cousin so that makes him my uncle right?  He passed away Friday night when we were at the movies.  He has been through a lot this past year and he was actually better and was discharged but he got sick again and passed away.  Skyped with my sister.  She's technically finished her school.  She just has to hand in her dissertation and complete her placement and she's done!  Yay!  We skyped for quite a bit.  Planned our EU trip for this Summer.  Like what we wanna do.  Caught up on stuff that's been happening.

5.  So, I started watching this Japanese variety show I used to watch when I was back in the UK.  I remember that for every meal, be it breakfast/lunch/dinner/brunch/midmorningthirdbreakfast/afternoontea/whatever, there was no tv so a bunch of us would all gather around this 15/17 inch laptop and watch it together and laugh and do stupid stuff.  I remember I joined this amazing race the committee had made as a spring event and my team wanted to know where the other team was so I just climbed up this 2 metre wall to scout them ahaha I couldn't see them but I could hear them!  I did get told off by the older committee members for doing something dangerous which I think they were concerned about because I'm like real small like 1.5 metres so I think they thought I would hurt myself real badly but the adrenaline got the better of me!  Adrenaline is so fun!  Those were fun times ahaha This was when I started living at a friend's house just because.  I think I stayed with them for like 3 months lol I only ever went back home to get clothes or school stuff.  Uni life was SO FUN.  

6.  I'm just gonna put this point in like parts because I don't really know how to format this how I would like soooooo yea lol Hopefully it turns out ok??

   a) Today, Sunday, I went to this talk.  It was by the same psychologist lady.  I went to her talk like a couple months ago??  It was about respect.  I thought it was a good talk.  I didn't want to go so before we left, I told Mum that I wanted to go to (surprise, surprise) the book store!  I kinda bribed her lol I told her that if I'm gonna have to go to a lecture then I should be rewarded for my good behavior!  My brother and youngest sister bought like a million books.  I only bought one!  Even the bookshop keeper (lol I just realized I have no idea what people who own book shops are called) noticed and a small conversation happened.  This is all mostly in our native language with bits of English here and there but this is how the conversation went in English.

   >Bookshop keeper:  You're only getting one, sweetie?

   >Me (jokingly):  Well, brother and sister took MY share!  It's supposed to be 5 each!  

   b) She knew I was joking and started laughing along.

   >Mum:  You should hire my kids to work off all the books they buy from here.

   >Bookshop keeper:  Just drop off their CVs and we will call them for an interview.

   >Me and brother:  Are you serious?

   >Bookshop keeper:  Yes.  Just drop it off and we will call you.

   >Me:  You know, we'd all probably just be in the corner over there reading books.

   c) My brother and youngest sister laughed and nodded agreeing with me and so was Mum and the bookshop keeper was too!

   >Bookshop keeper:  No, no!  You can't do that!  You have to work too!

   >Brother:  We'll be doing REAL slow inventory!

   >Me:  Yea, yea.  And doing book reviews!  

   d)The lady was quite amused with us and she definitely remembers us from our past visits lol No doubt she will definitely remember us as the maybe-employees who will sit in the corner reading books!  

7.  On a more depressing note, this has really not been my week.  For driving.  I feel like I'm becoming a TERRIBLE driver.  I'm not gonna say what I did but it mostly involves parking.  I can't park to save my life lol Ugh.  Maybe I should go back to driving school??

8.  Ok.  This is a bragging point.  Can I just say how proud I am that I have a Secret Santa trophy?!  Like, I don't know.  I JUST FEEL SO PROUD OF IT.  And it looks cute!

Ok, this is SUPER LONG so I will stop now before it's too late!  Have a good night, Reddit Diary!  :)

P.S  I suck at formatting so if this doesn't turn out how I want it to look then I give up lol"
"I didn't sleep last night. How could I? The photographic memory that I am cursed with held the screen shots Esky sent me in minds eye the whole night. 

He told her she was amazing and beautiful. Said he should have never left, that he was blind. Just... blow after blow. I'm realizing how insignificant I am.

He make excuses... he said he was sorry. I don't believe him. 

I don't want to do life anymore. Some one once said to me ""You need to go to the life store and exchange yours for a new one."" Thanks, Reddit, for that comment. The 1st of many like that when I sought advice on how to deal with him a few months ago. 

If only it was that simple. 

I'm at the doc with Boo Boo. Poor kid. He is always sick. I worked all day. Emails, spreadsheets, phone calls. My life is too busy. 

I feel like I don't have time to breathe anymore. Bill being around, it was good. But now I can't look at him. He is walking around pretending nothing happened and I'm still cold. My stomach is still rolling and the pictures are still in my head.

All night last night I just kept visualizing putting a gun to my head. It felt like relief would come if I did it.

I don't have a gun though. And I have too much responsibility to check out. I'm not Bill. I don't get to fall apart and be a mess. 

Too many people depend on me. The weight is heavy. The burden is crushing. 

I am thinking about going to counseling on my own. I am fucked up. My head is a disaster. Finding out there are other women... I can't even put complete thoughts to what that does to me. 

I just want to be loved."
"Lots of shit has happened. Lots, and I deleted all the before shit. I don't even know where to start. 

I found his car at her house. It was devastating. And then he moved back in. With me. He came home, we got in to church, we made an appointment with a counselor. These last 2 weeks have been pretty ok. 

He was still hiding something about her. I wasn't sure what. but I could feel it. 

I figured out how to unlock his phone. Its a pattern. Watch him draw it enough times, its not a complicated one... It unlocked 1st try. 

Most of it seemed pretty innocent. And then a text came in. Not from her, the Skank. From Esky. Yes, there is more than one. 

She is from a few years ago. She isn't even in the state next to us, She is across the damn country. He lived with her for a few months while he was working on the road in her town. 

She, of course, like the rest of us, fell in love with him. 

I didn't expect her. It was a blow. 

This all happened tonight. I couldnt stop shaking, I took his anxiety meds and woke him and told him I know. He grabbed his stuff to leave. He watched me hurt and break on the floor, he gave a weak apology when I accused him of not even being sorry and he just... let me hurt.

I feel like I have been gutted all over again. I can't get warm. I feel like I am dying within, deep in my gut and soul.

Why do I keep living this nightmare again and again?

Why does he torture me so?

Then I find out, it was multiple nights with the Skank. not just the one. 

Another blow. 

He still isn't sorry. He watched me hurt awhile longer... and then slipped out the back door... bag in tow.

We even went to counseling today... "
"Dear Reddit Diary,

1.  I'm feeling stressed. I don't know why but I am feeling stressed. So I made myself a nice hot cup of chamomile tea. Ahhh. I actually don't know if it really calms me down or acts as like a placebo type affect but as long as something can calm me down after a long day, I will take it!

2.  Ok so, my classes started again on Monday. Boooooo. Yesterday was a public holiday so there was no class so it will be, what's the word, transferred? No, no. Like paid back. I know the word! It's on the tip of my tongue! So instead of Monday - Wednesday it will be Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. What is that word?! I know there's a word for it! Postponed????? That doesn't sound right. Eh, whatever. My brain is probably fried so I can't think straight right now.

3.  Work is alright. My boss won't be back till next week so more chilling. Yay! Surprisingly, I have not been playing a lot of Hearthstone lol Mostly sudoku or other games. I think it's 'cause I'm waiting for Tavern Brawl. PLAYING RANKED IS JUST KILLING ME. I CAN'T KEEP DOING IT. NOT UNTIL STANDARD IS OUT.

4.  So, Monday was Chap Goh Mei! The lantern festival! It's not so obvious here because people just put lanterns up at their own houses but the loud fireworks played sure made it seem festive! But fireworks are banned so. I don't know. I'm pretty sure it was to celebrate Cahp Goh Mei lol

5.  Tuesday was a public holiday! Yay! Now seeing as the fireworks were on Monday night, I assume they are for Chap Goh Mei. But! It could have also been for Tuesday's public holiday. I seriously doubt it but if I was questioned by the cops for illegal fireworks, I would just say it's for Tuesday. Not for Chap Goh Mei lol So the cops can see me being patriotic!

6.  lol ok so I spent Tuesday across the border. I went to the bookstore where I, of course, bought books! Seriously. This is an addiction ahaha I bought quite a few creative idea books. Like to help me with some things I'm doing. Some puzzle books too. After lunch, I met up with my old classmates from when I graduated high school. Ugh gawd, WE ARE OLD. IT'S BEEN SO LONG. WHERE HAS THE TIME GONE. I haven't seen most of them since maybe a few years ago. I did see a few a couple of years ago lol It's safe to say I saw none of them last year ahaha So 2014 was when I last saw a few of them. After I started working I saw them less and less. We did the obligatory group photo. Ugh I hate taking photos lol It's just not built in my DNA. I was kinda told off for not being on my phone! Ahahahaha yeeeeeeeeeaa I suck at keeping in contact with people so a friend of mine who's going back to Australia told me to give her something she can contact me with. She did the ""Testing 1 2 3"" when she texted me lol OK OK I WILL CHECK MY PHONE MORE OFTEN. GAWD. When she found out I don't use my phone much, she said to me, ""Oh, so you're one of THOSE people."" LOL WHAT PEOPLE. I DON'T KNOW ANY OF *THOSE* PEOPLE. AS FAR AS I KNOW, *I'M* THE ONLY ONE WHO HATES TEXTING.


7.  Yea so, quite a bit happened. Like more than usual. Especially during the early part of the week. Do I have anything else to say. I think that's all. Oh, I go to my sister's new house now after work. So I don't have to drive all the way back home after work then drive all the way to town again for class. That's nice. More time to just relax and enjoy a nice hot cup of tea. I swear, I could be British with the amount of tea I drink ahaha The only difference is I don't have milk or sugar in mine. I like the taste of tea on its own. Just not so dark lol

Ok goodnight, Reddit Diary!"
"Dear Diary,

Well shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. SHIT.

Ran into my ex at Starbucks today. It wasn't awkward even a little bit. I don't think it was for either of us. His ears did their happy go up thing that they always did when he got really excited about something. It was probably subconscious, like the stupid smile I had plastered on my face when I saw him. His mirrored mine like, exactly. Except his ears went up. 

We exchanged pleasantries and then I asked if he had gotten my email about a stupid book he had emailed to me just before we broke up. He said he did. He asked if I wanted him to reply. I told him if he wanted to. At this point, I smiled at him even bigger---because the smile never left my face---and felt really choked up and went inside. I couldn't even say goodbye. 

It was in that fucking moment that I realized how much I fucking miss him and how much I love him. I can't get his eyes out of my head now. Or his new haircut. Or that stupid vest he always liked to wear. I can't get his smile or his voice to go away either. Fuck, I miss him. I want him back. I want him back so bad. But we can't be together. I have come so far in learning how to love myself---if I give in and call him up and ask him about going out to coffee sometime, 98.75% guaranteed to end up in his bed and back at square one. He hurt me. I have to be strong and remember he dumped me on my ass just before Christmas. It doesn't matter that we were happy to see each other. It doesn't. I love myself too much to put myself through that again. I can't do it. Not now. I've come too far. 

I would love to talk to Crocface about this. But if you are to keep a man interested in you for two years while you both work on finishing school, you have to stay positive and avoid bringing up your ex. I want Crocface more than I want my ex. My ex had his chance and he blew it. I have to remember that. Crocface is a really nice guy. I mean, Scott is nice too. But Crocface? He's never dumped me and left me in a foreign country to fend for myself---when he knew all *our* friends would ditch me---just before **Christmas**. 

I brought my bamboo tablet to school with me today. Gonna start doodling after I finish my WTF entry. Ugh. I just can't believe my luck. The little girl I tutor this evening always asks about Scott---which stopped making me cry after about three weeks---and I don't know if I'm going to be able to hold back tonight. I don't know if I'm going to be able to stay strong on this one. 

Crocface. Crocface. Crocface. Just gonna go look at pictures of him while these stupid drivers take forever to download. 

Shit. Shit. Shit. 

-Stranded

PS, I really need to update the year."
"Dear Diary,

I'm so happy to be getting back into the habit of things and stuff. Got up this morning, ate some chocolate and went to the convenience store to get chocolate soy milk, coffee, and tea. Got to school, taught two classes and now I'm sitting in my office, doing nothing. 

Crocface finally messaged me back. Guess I didn't scare him off yet. I'm happy I haven't scared him. I really like him a lot. He gives me hope that life isn't gonna suck and that I still have a shot at a relationship---even though I feel like I'm used goods.

I've been thinking about starting to write again. I might go home in a few to draw. I dunno. I've been feeling really inspired to be creative ever since I met Crocface. I think that's a huge reason I like him so much. I haven't felt inspired to draw or write or sew or do creative things in so long. Suddenly, I meet a guy that makes me want to be me and do the things I used to love doing again---and people wonder WHY I have such strong feelings for him. 

Yesterday, we had a company meeting. It was complete and utter HORSE SHIT. I hate company meetings because every single time, we all have to introduce ourselves and nobody cares and nobody wants to do it and it takes 45 minutes. They had no real announcements and called us in to waste our time---and theirs because OMFG YESTERDAY WAS LANTERN FESTIVAL. They could've taken half a day off and enjoyed themselves. Instead, no. Let's call EVERYBODY IN and WASTE EVERYBODY'S TIME.

Oh well. Wasn't that bad. Got to see some of the people I haven't seen in a long time. That part was nice. 

This Saturday, I'm going to go play Smash Bros. for a few hours clear across town. That's going to be fun. Hopefully. I usually get really awkward in group settings where I don't really know anyone. I'm going to know Scottish Guy---KIND of. I mean, we saw Deadpool together, but ah...he's quiet. Doesn't really talk too much. I should probably get drunk before I go so that I can make friends. Apparently having friends is healthy or something.

Peace. Love. Coffee.

"Dear Diary,

Oh my GOD am I happy to be back at work. I don't have to fuss with my laptop's keyboard anymore and I have somewhere aside from my futon to be. I am no longer being lazy! How many people do you know that friggin complain about vacation being too long?

While on vacation, I did a whole lot of things. I went to Japan, fell almost in love with someone and reflected a whole lot about my last relationship and why it wasn't healthy. Hopefully, if I ever have another relationship again, I will be able to take what I've learned from this one and apply it to the next.

Set my alarm for 6:55 this morning. Hit snooze until 7:45. Sat up. Reset my alarm for 7:47 because that's the name of an aircraft and snuggled with my pillow a bit longer. Alarm went off too soon haha. Got up, threw my blanket off of me and stumbled into my bathroom to brush my teeth and put my hair up in my obligatory teacher ponytail. Pulled my obligatory hoodlum warmer over my head (because the teachers here think it's strange when I dress like they do) and then downed some tea. Realized I was supposed to be in my office and then, instead of booking it to school, zombied my way to the bakery. Hell yeah! OBTAINED COFFEE. And bread. Because I'm out of bread at home.

Get to school, still looking like a zombie. Talked to British Guy That Complains Too Much in his office next door while waiting for someone to open my office (Monday is flag raising ceremony, so the students and teachers stand outside and be patriotic) because I was retarded and lost my office key during break. It was that or go stand outside and freeze my ass off. British Guy That Complains Too Much was pretty talkative and proceeded to inform me why he couldn't see Deadpool (WHICH WAS AMAZING) in Hong Kong---something about his friend having a stroke and a whole lot of repeating himself about how the quality of his illegally obtained copy (instead of being concerned about his friend). 

Taught first period. So happy. My students all yelled my name when I walked into the classroom and hugged me. At least fifty hugs so far today. Which makes me a little reluctant to return home to America to finish school up. :/ I'm going to miss my babies. All 1200 of them. ;~;

Today I have to go into the company office for a shitty meeting. At least I'll get to see all my friends. That'll be nice. Haven't seen THOSE people in like, more than a month. 7 weeks? Holy shit. Yeah. 7 weeks. I'm not sure why SD is having us come in, other than to be dicks. That's their favorite pass time, after all. Being dicks. This is where I wish my school would tell SD to kindly fuck off so that I could stay in my office and ~~perfect my lesson plans~~ sit on reddit and write stories and study and fold paper cranes. 

I started on a journey. I started folding paper cranes. Why? Because. You get a wish if you fold 1000 of them. Let's see if I can do it. Let's see if I'm dedicated enough for this shit. 

Not sure if Crocface is mad at me, if he's just super busy, or if I've finally managed to scare him off. Haven't decided. I guess we'll see if he talks to me in a few days. I probably made the mistake of writing him a novel. Gonna be really sad if he peaces out and never talks to me again. Borderline heartbroken. Borderline. ;~;

Today marks the day that I fall back into the pattern of going to school, then tutoring, then vaguely cleaning my house, turning Spirited Away on, and falling asleep. Anyway, diary, I must break into my desk (keys to that are gone forever too). I should probably make my lesson one continuous lesson instead of what I have going on with my PPTs. 

Peace. Love. Coffee. Coffee. Coffee. Coffee.

"Dear Reddit Diary,

1.  As the title suggests, I just had a birthday!  It's actually today ahaha Another year older.  Not sure about the wiser part though lol I remember I used to keep track and count down the days til my birthday but I think it was after I turned 21 that it didn't feel as special anymore.  Like there isn't much of a difference.  I actually forgot it was today!  My cousin was the one that reminded me.  I have to keep remembering my age because I certainly don't look it.  If people ask me how old I am, I just say 22 on auto.  Like my brain is capped at that age somehow lol 

2.  Ok so, I am sad, Reddit Diary.  I am very sad.  Remember I told you that my next class would be in 5 weeks?  Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaa well, it's been pushed up early.  Like real early.  Like tomorrow.  Sigh.  Well, at least I had one week off.  So I will be busy for the next 3 months at least.  At least I'll be preoccupied!  And uhm, no lol I did not do all my homework.  All 5 weeks of it.  Nope.  Not any of it.  Not one.  I have no idea what the homework is even about.  I barely touched it!  Eh, I'll do it tomorrow.  It'll be easy!  What could possibly go wrong?

3.  I honestly don't really have a clue what I did this week.  Like besides work.  I started watching anime again.  That's probably the only new thing in my life right now ahaha I'm rewatching D. Gray-Man.  I wanna catch up before the new one gets released.  Don't know if they'll continue the storyline or it'll be totally different so just to be on the safe side of no spoilers, I will just rewatch everything.  I would love to reread the manga but I barely made it through since it kept on going on hiatus.  One episode a day should suffice ahaha

4.  I didn't do anything on Saturday.  Like I was just home.  Cuddling my cats.  Watching tv.  Playing a few games.  Oh, I played FF Type-0!  Ugh it's been so long since I played with a controller!  I really suck now lol  I need to get used to the controller feel again!  

5.  How I spent my birthday?  We didn't do much.  Just went out to brunch and had cake.  Just Mum, Dad, brother, sister and me.  I didn't know that they had a cake ready there!  That was a bit of a surprise ahaha It's a red velvet cake!  I'm not much of a cake person so when there's a type of cake I like, you can bet that I will eat it!  I got a few more greetings from people.  I don't know why but I feel like birthdays are weird lol Like if you're a kid then yea,  I get it but once you're like an adult, it feels like it doesn't really matter anymore.  Maybe it's 'cause I'm not used to celebrating birthdays.  Who knows.

6.  Ok so, what else to say?  Uhm, I will be moving some of my things to my sister's house.  So I won't have to drive all the way back home after work.  I can just stop there for a bit then go to class then go back home.  It will give me like an extra 30 minutes to relax after work so that's cool.  I won't be staying the night there.  That would be a bit weird lol Maybe after I get more comfortable but for now, it'll just be a pit stop for after-work-before-class thing.

7.  This entry has gotten a bit longer than I like so I will just end here!  I have work tomorrow but Tuesday is a public holiday!  Wooooo!  Mum said we're going to cross the border!  That means I can go to the bookstore!  Yay!

Goodnight, Reddit Diary!"
"Dear Diary, 

It's sad to look back on things and watch as what was once your profound love for somebody spoiled and slowly turned to hate. Looking back over the course of the last three years of my life, I replayed in my head how I grew to become so angry and even sometimes hateful. 

It all started when Scott told me he'd be working in China for a year. He didn't talk to me about it first. He was just like, ""I'm moving to China for a year. Come visit me."" I felt betrayed because he was leaving me and he didn't talk to me about it. And things all went downhill from there. 

Next, he started getting really close to a girl---in my head, the girl of his dreams. Things become so warped when you are young and anxious. He stayed the night with her in a massage parlor. Two separate beds. Shouldn't have even been a thing. But it was. And I cried. I cried and I cried and I cried because, in my mind, he had betrayed me. If that were to happen today, I'd be like, ""Did you sleep with her? No? Cool. Don't do it again."" But that was then. And he and I argued about her for the next year. 

But the feeling I felt and he felt, the feeling we shared in the airport when I stepped into the arrival hall after six months of being apart has yet to be matched. It was the happiest moment of my life. Probably his too. That moment in time was pure bliss. I still remember the feeling of his vest and his arms. I still remember the way he smelled. That moment of love and devotion and hugging and tears made us both forget that I was growing to hate him.

Until he asked for another year in China. All I wanted was to go home and start our life together and go back to school. He had his year. It was my turn. But he looked like he was going to cry when I told him no. He was so depressed for the next few days that I couldn't stand it. I couldn't bear to be the one to be the cause of his pain, so I told him move to China with him. I'll never forget his smile.

But for every single sacrifice I made for him, my love for him was replaced with bitterness. Instead of thinking about how blessed I was to have him, I started thinking about how few sacrifices he'd made for me. And then I started keeping score and my mind twisted everything around so that I was somehow never good enough and that he would never give back to me. 

I started becoming outwardly negative after I was put into the hospital. My IUD (the one I'd gotten because that's what HE wanted) was infected and the infection had spread so far that it nearly killed me. And he was reluctant to stay in the hospital with me. I think that was the straw that broke the camel's back. Looking back, I realize now that he was so busy with his studying and work and the extra classes he'd taken on that I took his tiredness for being bitter toward me for being sick. I thought he somehow blamed me. I didn't think of the sacrifice he was making to be with me---all I thought about was how it wasn't enough. I'd given everything for him, yet he couldn't stay the night in the hospital with me. 

That's when I started telling him how much I hated his haircut. And his shoes. And the TV shows he watched. Why didn't he help more around the house? Couldn't he make time to go on a date with me? Why hadn't he proposed yet? We'd been together for 4 years. What was wrong with him? 

Looking back, especially when you're sad, makes it so that you blame yourself an awful lot and you tend to turn the other person into a saint. It's hard to see the other person's flaws because you're so busy wallowing in self-pity. 

Scott wasn't perfect. He should've spent more time with me, made me his number one from time to time. He should have compromised a little more. But such is life. 

Life is not perfect. It's full of imperfections. But, without the bad times, it's hard to appreciate the good ones. Back to work tomorrow. Tell y'all how it goes. 

Peace. Love. Coffee.

"Dear Reddit Diary,

1.  I have been on catch-up-tv mode for the past week.  And I've been watching/listening to How to Train your Dragon 1 and 2.  Like I just love the soundtracks.  I get really emotional just listening to it!  Like I swear, if you quized me which score was in what scene, I'd nail it ahaha I'm just a sucker for animation and awesome music!

2.  Work has been going pretty well.  We are ahead of schedule so I'll definitely be slowing down now since there's no longer anything needed in a rush.  Good timing too since my brain is just on a meltdown by the time I get home.  Oh, and my boss is on leave till next month so that's an added bonus!  Yay!  I see me playing Hearthstone a lot in the next two weeks ahaha

3.  Tuesday was my aunt's birthday.  No idea how old she is since she doesn't really tell me but late 40s early 50s.  I think she just turned 50.  I am not so sure.  Mum took her out for a special birthday lunch with my other aunt and cousin.  Mum got me a banana muffin!  I ate it after I got home from work so that was a nice treat to come home to!

4.  Oh, I took Monday off.  I was about to leave for work when Mum told me my cousin passed away.  So I went to the funeral.  I won't go into detail of how he passed.  When they brought his body home, my aunt was devastated.  She was just sobbing and shaking.  He's her eldest son.  I don't know him all that well since he's like 20 years older than me but he regularly visits my grandfather's grave when he goes to see his dad's.  He left behind 4 kids I think.  They're real young too.  Not even teenagers yet.

5.  Ok, so I don't want to end on like a sad note sooooooooo my cats??  My cats are such wonderful babies!  They will meow at me and follow me around!  It's just lovely to be worshipped ahaha I am a bit too mean to them and bully them a bit but I guess they can see through that.  I give them lots of cuddles.  Cuddles are good.  It's fun.  Especially the purring!  I love them, they love me.  That's happy right?!

Ok, goodnight, Reddit Diary!"
"Dear Reddit Diary,

1.  Yea, ok, I know today is Valentine's Day.  The whole world does!  But I actually forgot and didn't realize it until I wrote the date in the title lol I mostly remember it as a the day of a massacre ahaha I wonder why Valentine's Day is on February 14th.  I'm too lazy and can't be bothered to check out why so I will just accept it.

2.  I am so glad I don't have any classes anymore!  It's only for a month but it's still freedom!  I was given homework though.  Like 5 exercises because that is how long the break is so one exercise a week until the new classes start.  Meh.  I'll do it like in 3 weeks or something.  

3.  I saw Deadpool yesterday!  I actually had to cross the border to watch it because it's banned here.  Pfsh.  Well, that didn't stop me!  I did get asked for ID but so what?!  I got to watch it!  I felt so badass going against the ban.  I saw it with Mum and my brother.  We did warn her that it's rated 18 but she said she'd just watch it.  Of course she did not really enjoy it and at the end said she shouldn't have brought us and we just laughed lol My brother made fun of me since I was asked for ID and he wasn't and he's younger than I am.  Pfsh.  It's not my fault I'm so baby faced.  I JUST AGE WELL OK.  NOT LIKE YOU BRO.

4.  OMG I FINALLY CLAIMED THE FINAL FANTASY TYPE-0 CODE FROM MY MSI MOBO.  IT TOOK SO LONG 'CAUSE I NEEDED TO GO TO A COUNTRY THAT IT'S ELIGIBLE TO BE CLAIMED FROM.  BUT NOW I FINALLY HAVE IT!  AND I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY IT!  IT'S STILL UPDATING!

5.  Ok, ok, no more caps lock.  I'm calm.  I am calm.  

6.  I ALSO MANAGED TO UPDATE MY PREMIUM SPOTIFY ACCOUNT.  CAUSING TOO MUCH TROUBLE BECAUSE I AM IN AN UNREGISTERED COUNTRY.  PFSH.

7.  Ok, ok, now I am REALLY done shouting lol I'll tell you what though, Reddit Diary.  I am very persistent ahaha Especially if it's something I really want.  It really annoys Mum lol

8.  Ok, so now moving on to Sunday, I went to the city and went to this seminar.  I guess it's called a seminar.  It was about communicating to people effectively and positively.  It was mostly directed at talking to kids and teaching them good values like honesty.  It was a good talk but I think it's mostly aimed at parents.  Like new or soon to be parents.  Like train communicating with them while they're still young and it's easy for them to understand.  Parents with adult children I'd say is a bit late because the kids are all grown up and we all get more stubborn the older we get but I guess they can learn a thing or two as well.  I only went 'cause Mum made me.  Saying it would be good to go so I would be prepared to raise my children.  Uhm, ok Mum but, I'm not even married lol You're gonna have to wait quite a bit if you want grandkids.  Some of the parenting flaws pointed out were definitely what my mum has done to my siblings and I but hey, we didn't come with an instruction manual when we were born so she did the best she could.  My siblings and I did laugh at some of the things the host said like if a parent says no so many times then the child is most likely just gonna do whatever they want without telling the parents.  My brother and sister turned to look at me ahahahahaha!

9.  This week has been quite busy.  Next week everything's gonna slow down so I am happy about that!  Time to catch up on stuff.   I am really behind on several things so I am looking forward to a nice break the next few weeks!

10.  Oh, oh the postcards I sent to a friend arrived!  I forgot to mention it in my last entry!  While I was in Singapore, I sent a few postcards to a friend in Texas!  He's a penpal of mine who I met on Reddit and I just bombarded him with postcards!  I really thought they might have gotten lost or something so when he emailed me saying he received them, I was beyond ecstatic!  I love getting postcards I send to myself so him getting 3 is just such an awesome feeling!  I didn't tell him I had sent them.  I wanted them to be a surprise!  He knew I was sending him a postcard.  Just not when or how many!  I NEED TO SEND MORE.  I don't know if he follows my posts on Reddit but YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.  So, get a bigger mail box because it will be full of stuff from me!  :D

11.  Ok, this post has gotten so long!  I have work tomorrow and would like to sleep as much as possible tonight!  I didn't get to catch up on sleep this weekend so I will have to sleep early for the next few nights at least.  Nyeh.  Why am I a night owl?!

Goodnight, Reddit Diary!  "
"Dear Diary,

Vacation is almost over. I am feeling a whole lot more optimistic than I was a month and a half back. In fact, spending so much time alone has really, really helped me reach an understanding of myself that I never thought I'd know. It's kind of cool, knowing who you are and not being afraid to be who you are. It's freeing.

When I was with my ex, (I think he needs a real name ahhh, let's call him Higgins) I was really afraid of being who I am. I was afraid of saying something wrong. I was always walking on eggshells to preserve what we had because, honestly, I love him more than the moon and stars. 

Reflecting back on it, Higgins and I were never meant to be. We simply come from two different worlds. We are two different people. I don't really desire his partnership anymore. Even though we knew what the other wanted and we knew each other better than anyone else, we simply did not mesh. We grew apart instead of together. It's sad, when you look back and watch your love wither and die. But it's life. 

I think knowing that we both felt the need to suppress who we really were is the saddest part of our relationship dying. We both didn't know how to act around each other because we were both afraid of hurting one another. In the end, I suppose, that's what killed us. That's what ended us. 

Fast forward to the end of January, and I'm the happiest I've ever been. The sunshine finally crept into my life. I don't exactly know when it changed, when I didn't feel like throwing myself off a building or sitting in my kitchen, waiting for it to fill with CO2...but it did. It changed. I'm so happy. I can be me. I don't have anyone to answer to except for myself. 

Geebz has really been there for me. She keeps me sane. She keeps me in check. She is there for me when I need it and when I don't. She's the best friend I could ever ask for. She always knows what to say and always knows what to do. She is an incredible person and I really hope that she finds a guy soon. She's really concerned about that. I don't think she should be, but, you know. 

Enter some new characters! We have Socksguy! He's a graphic artist and a manager dude. He's truly my twin. He really brings in sunshine. He and I like the same things and react to things in the same manner. We have similar religious morals (not beliefs) and he's friggin awesome. He's fun to be around. Socksguy and I don't wear matching socks often and we met because we were discussing socks in the elevator. We were talking and we were both surprised to find that we were both wearing matching socks on the same day.

Dr. Sumo! Dr. Sumo is an Aussie dude I met while in Japan. He and I instantly clicked. He's also kind of like a brother, but not exactly, but also still kind of like a brother. He isn't my twin, that's for sure, but he's educating me in all things Australia and all things Greek. He's really fun to talk to. Also interesting to talk to. We can go from talking about something super serious and deep to talking about something light-hearted and funny in like, 2.5, and it feels completely natural. There's nothing forced there. He's a researcher dude, so hearing about his work is inspiring because I'll be going back to school this fall for biology.

Steve Irwin! Well, that's obviously not his real name, but his Steve Irwin impression is spot-on. There's an entire separate entry I'll write up about Mr. Irwin heh heh. He's incredible. Gah. He's so wonderful in like, every way imaginable. He's funny and sweet and sexy and smart and gah! He smells so good! Like, I don't know what he uses, but omg. Smelling him makes me crazy. We talk, in my opinion, quite a bit. We've been exchanging youtube videos and music and whyyyyyyyy does he have to live in Australia? Whyyyyyyy am I stranded in China? Whyyyyyyyy must I go back to school this fall in the US? Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.

I'm going to pop into ah, Australia, on my way home to ~~see him~~ drink coffee in some cafes and climb some mountains and stuff. You know. The usual traveling things. I'm pretty excited to go even though everything is going to try to kill me. Less than 5 months. 

Just thought that I'd update a little and let people know that I'm not dead and that I have a new outlook on life. :)

Peace. Love. Coffee.

"A few days ago, for a moment, it looked like the archived chats on a site where deleted. God, I almost broke down, panicked and etc before I confirmed they were still there. All the conversations with her, I can't let go.

I then found the little drawing she made me fore v-day '14. I can't part with it. I have to put it somewhere safe.

I woke up a fe days ago from a dream, second one is a row with her. Some sort of military thing. I don't get my brain. Wrecked me for the day, luckily I was alone.

I was raspberrying the dog, I'd just laid down with her to snuggle up, and decided to give her one. And it hit me, doing it to Bubz. Her doing it to Bubs.. And the night we first kiss, I'd done them to her.

Ah, that pain. It's calmed down quite a bit but still, heh, I weep. I can't tell anyone that it's this bad still. That I just keep it buried, I smile and act like I am just doing my thing. People notice that I'd down but they'll never know the madness that consumes me. Love and ADHD, well heartbreak anyhow...it's like every time you look away you have to glance back because they're in the corner of your vision. The way the mind constantly hops and brings them back to surface. It's amazingly terrible.

Ah, but I love her, I really do and to be honest I know she's just a memory but there was so much I loved about her. She could be an entirely different person by now but I think I could still love her if she hasn't changed the way she laughs or smiles. The way she practically closed her eyes and grinned. Caramel Mocchiato. Bright colors, orange. Octopuses. Turquoise jewelry. Dangly earring, just one. The way she'd look up when cuddling the dog. She always did something nice for me. She had an atrocious sleeping face that I loved. It'd just make me happy to watch her sleep.

And I gotta let all that go. Ah, pain again. Wet eyes. TBH, writing this to get it out because I was lying awake unable to sleep for the presssence.

I've told myself that after the 13th I don't have any excuse to hold on. I gotta let her go. The dream girl, the greatest love I've known. My greatest and most terrible mistake. All of it, flush it back to my mind to haunt me when I'm 60.

It's all but killed me and at a few points it could have.

I love her. I do, to the core of my person. I let her into my very soul. I wanted to, I wanted her forever even if I'm just a man who get destroyed by a shit life, by shit people. It was her at the end of the day I hoped to see. And for a while I was a real shit, but I can't think of a day I didn't say ""I love you."" And yeah, big life lession: that's not enough.

I gotta let her go. But I really want to just break down, like some torrential dam bursting inside me. Pour it all out. The pain and my love and never let it hurt again.

Just please, whatever powers are greater than I, let me find a way back to normal. Let me just have some meager life after squandering the only blessing I've known.

I just have to let go, afterall. After all these years, a decade... Really? Pretty close.. A decade of my life with one girl sneaking into my heart. A third of my time on this world. And yet it's nothing, I want so much more. I want..I want.,,

I love. I love but yet I fail.. And I gotta let go in the end or drown my existence in her memory till calamity takes me.

I love you dear, I love your dearly. I miss you and the dog more than you can fathom and if it's only a small indicator to let you know how much you really meant and how much I was in love.

I gotta let go though. There's no sign of ever seeing you again and I don't think I'm going to be able to keep this going...keep me going.. if I can't have my heart back.

If I can't love ever again.

But maybe it's what I get. Fuck, I am so sorry."
"Dear Reddit Diary,

1.  This is just gonna be real short because I am exhausted and want to sleep.

2.  So, Monday was Chinese New Year (新年快乐!  :D) so it was a public holiday!  I know I told you I had awesome plans.  And believe me, they were *awesome*.  I played Duelyst and I am just hooked!  I am still learning it so I'm not very good but it's a lot of fun!  I basically caught up on sleep and played my games.  It was an awesome day.

3.  Blizzard released a statement today (my time) saying that more info about the next expansion of Hearthstone will be out on March 9th.  So I assume that the new expansion won't be taken into effect until mid March at the earliest.  Which doesn't really make sense to me since there's gonna be a new ranking system so it should be released at the start of the month so I think it'll be April before anyone can actually have any access to it.  Maybe just the cards will be out first then the new format will be later.  Doesn't make sense to release the new format first if its in the middle of the month.  Unless it won't count as that month's reward.  I don't know!  I just have too many questions right now of what and when about this new expansion but I am overall really excited!  Please come soon!

4.  Tomorrow night is my last class until March.  If I decided to continue.  Honestly, I do want to just do everything.  It's not like I'm doing anything really productive at home.  Even though I'll be super exhausted, I think it's at least a start in a good direction.  I know that if I stop, I'll have trouble starting back up.  I don't want to get complacent.  I don't want to stop being a better me.  I want to be the best that I can be!

5.  Ok, I need sleep.  I think I have a meeting on Friday.  I'm not so sure.   I'll have to ask but fingers crossed I don't have to!

Goodnight, Reddit Diary!"
"09:30

I needed something to document online daily. I dont need replies, or likes, really. 

I change my life around today! I need to become an adult. I'm 22 years of age and so immature that it's dreadful. People who read these entries can look at this as almost a guide to becoming an adult. I'll document daily what its like to adopt responsibilities. Facing Fears. Doing hard work to get to where you want to be.

Today my girlfriend broke up with me because I was too immature. Well. I am. And I'm older. It's weird really. Felt like i wanted it too. And i was really insecure. 

Okay. Without further ado, lets start with ""JOBS"". It should be easy to apply one for one, right? Well. Its a pain. And so is everything else. Will update more later. 

Simply told; if you're reading this, then you're reading about a 22 year old ""baby""."
"Dear Reddit Diary,

1.  GREETINGS FROM SINGAPORE!

2.  I'm not gonna write much 'cause I'm gonna go out soon so just a mini update of my trip so far!

3.  Flight was alright.  I was pretty agitated all morning on Wednesday.  JUST TOO EXCITED.

4.  Did a bit of shopping after we landed and dropped our bags off at the hotel.  FOUND A BOOKSTORE.  It't not Kinokuniya.  Haven't gone there yet. Probably later today or early tomorrow before our flight back home.

5.  Spent the ENTIRE day at Universal Studios Singapore yesterday!  Didn't manage to go on Battlestar Galactica: Human VS Cyclon and  the Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure.  Not too upset about those since I did get to go on the ones I really wanted to go to.  They would be extra bonuses if I went on them but oh well.  THERE'S ALWAYS NEXT TIME!

6.  My brother and sister are sick lol Brother had to go to the emergency room in the middle of the night.  He has an ear infection.  Sister has the flu, I think.  It's flu season and everyone's getting sick.  Probably 'cause of the weather.  Good thing I got sick before the trip!

7.  I bought a seal wax kit!  So now letters I write and mail will look totally legit!

8.  MORE INFO WHEN I GET BACK.  I NEED FOOD.  I AM HUNGRY.  GONNA GO FOR BREAKFAST SOON.  THEN ELECTRONICS.  MAYBE THE BOOKSTORE.  MAYBE SHOES.  I DON'T KNOW.  I AM JUST SO EXCITED.

HAVE A GOOD DAY, REDDIT DIARY!  :D"
"Dear Reddit Diary,

1.  I'm just gonna type in points now.  I like writing them in lists and checking things off said list.  This is the part where I insert the *I just love checklists* gif from Meet the Robinsons.  I should watch that movie again.  I love that movie.

2.  Like the title says, this is the last entry of 2015 and honestly, I don't know how to feel about this year ending 'cause honestly,  it just felt like it was just beginning.

3.  And yes I know this entry is a little earlier than usual but I have been in a Hearthstone craze the past two days so I really want to get it out of my system.  Or else I'll be playing while at work or watch videos or streams of people playing and just be upset that I can't play till I go home.  Meh.

4.  Been in a Top Gear craze too.  Rewatching from season 1.  It's usually Doctor Who or a cartoon show or movie but no Doctor Who 'cause of something that happened a while back so I can't watch it without feeling a bit sad.  Already seen so many cartoon shows on repeat (I'm looking at you Futurama!) and movies, I tell you, Reddit Diary, I think I have practically memorized every line in all the movies I have seen.  Jk I have a terrible memory lol So Top Gear it is!  I miss the trio too so it fills in that void ahaha

5.  To end this entry on a VERY happy note: my Secret Santa giftee got my gift!  I was hesitant at first on signing up since I've never done an international one before but I did anyways and he's all the way in Canada!  I was overthinking and being anxious and worried and just nervous.  I was worried he wouldn't like it or it would get lost in the mail or it would be broken when he opened it.  Just worried but he just posted his gift online and I am glad it made it's way safely to him!  

So yea.  That's a nice way to end 2015.  I'll see you next year, Reddit Diary!  

Goodnight!  :)

(P.S Yes, I know 2015 doesn't end till tomorrow, Reddit Diary, but I can't post tomorrow 'cause of a weekly family thing so I am doing it today!)"
"Dear Diary,

The stuff that I was stressed and depressed about last week seems trivial next to my next big roadblock. I realized that, because I am going to move back to the US this summer, I have a mountainous task laid before me: I must find a job and a place to live.

Doesn't sound so difficult, right? Wrong. 

First and foremost, I'm going to have to go back to being a server due to some circumstances. That's not a job I can apply for several months in advance. Best case scenario, I can apply a month before I get back and have a job waiting for me. Worst case scenario, I'm going to have to drop my resume off at various locations, in person.

Which brings me to item number two. I am going to have to have a place to stay. Places aren't going to rent to me without having a job unless I have a really fat bank account, which is something I am severely lacking in. So, worst case scenario, I'm going to have to couch surf for two months while I build up a work history. Best case scenario, I'll find a private rental and someone will just rent to me. But I gotta bank of worst-case scenarios. Prepare for the worst.

One of the options I may have is staying with my ex's mom while I get on my feet. I don't think she'd have a problem with it, especially if I offered to help out. But we'll see. That's the second-best case scenario. I'm just praying that if that happens, she doesn't put any pressure on Ex and I to reconcile. Right now, it's best that we don't. Maybe someday, but I really gotta learn to be my own person. 

Living on my own has been an interesting experience thus far. I've spent a lot of time by myself, especially recently. And it's been quite eye-opening. I'm learning how to make myself happy and how to laugh. I'm learning that it's okay if my socks don't match and that I am my own person. I'm not defined by anyone else. It's so strange.

I haven't been out of a relationship since I was like, 14. I've constantly been in one, you know? So it's been interesting.

The way they celebrate Christmas in China is so strange. I found ornaments of evil pumpkins and pictures of Santa plastered everywhere. Their decorations are less than traditional and completely gaudy too. Imagine worse quality than dollar tree decorations being vomited everywhere. Hahaha. 

Aside from that, Christmas isn't a big deal here. They give **erasers** and **pens**. 

New Year's is coming up. Gonna go celebrate at my friend's apartment with board games and pajamas. I'm pretty excited. I'm actually really happy to go. :)

I have papers to grade and a lesson to make. Things are looking up.

Peace. Love. Coffee.

"Dear Reddit Diary,

I had such an awesome and fun weekend!  I can't remember the last time I had so much fun and just crash right after getting home!

A lot happened this weekend so I'll try to be short.  So maybe in points again?  FYI this weekend includes Thursday and Friday 

1.  So I did cross the border on Thursday and went to the bookstore and of course, buy books.  *cough* 12 to be exact *cough* I seriously have an addiction but it's ok!  Books are awesome.

2.  Friday had breakfast with Dad and then later left for the city to go to the cousins place for our annual sleepover!  Wooooooooooo!  Dad couldn't come 'cause he was stuck on duty and he had to be within 30 minutes of point X and Y so pfffff.  Fiiiiiiiiiiiiine.  It's ok.  I felt bad Mum had to drive alone all the way back home but she said she was ok with it.  At least I drove on the way there so she only had to drive halfway.

3.  Spent most of the rest of the weekend with the cousins and aunt and uncle going out instead of staying in lol We are a family that likes to do stuff!  Christmas day was kinda spent half with Mum and Dad then the other half driving to the cousins then we went out to the cinema and played this escape room experience!  

4.  We actually did 4 different escape room experiences.  Yea, I know.  We're crazy lol But it was totally fun!  The themes we did were prison break, maze, time travel and mad house.  We were frightened at all of them.  The music and screaming and clock ticking just made us all the more anxious!  I wanna so do it again but probably in a few months at least.  It's gonna get boring if they don't change the puzzles once in a while and everyone will remember how to solve it.  So yea.  I'll wait till I forget everything lol We didn't manage to finish the time travel and the mad house.  Time travel was 'cause we were split into 2 teams, past and future, and I was in future with my cousin while my brother and sister were in the past so we had to wait for them to solve their own puzzles to find the walkie.  It took them soooooooooooooooooooo long and then our walkie died so we couldn't ""talk"" to the past!  Mad house was 'cause we just got so tired since it was the last one and it was real dark and really scary.  Maybe another time!  The fastest one we did was the maze and it was soooooooooo cool.  I want to do more!  But my poor brain!

5.  The movies we saw were Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.  We saw Star Wars again 'cause aunt and uncle hadn't seen it so watching it again brought even more feels!  The Chipmunks movie wasn't so bad and the people laughing was mostly us lol It's a nice family movie but maybe not a lot of people enjoyed it like us?  lol I don't know.

6.  Cousin and I were planning on starting our book club.  lol just us two a-ha-ha  ha sooooooo sad.  But then we asked my sister and brother and my sister said ok.  Brother is too lazy pfsh.  So we each chose a book we each wanted then drew slots to see who goes first.  Cousin is first, sister second and me third.  Cousin chose The Hobbit so we gonna read to a certain page each week and we start tomorrow!  Good thing I have a copy of The Hobbit!  It's the kids edition split into two parts but who cares?!  It looks cool!

7.  Just got back home today.  Mum came to pick us up and she drove on her own.  I drove back though.  We did make a couple of pit stops.  Had to buy cat food for the babies and then stopped by my late grandparents' house 'cause Mum wanted to check on something at the house.

8.  Mum and aunt and uncle said we might be staying over again for new year's.  I don't really have a problem with that.  None of us do actually so I guess that's the plan for next week!  Firewooooooooooooooooooorks!  Or they're staying at our place.  Or in a hotel.  Or wherever.  DOES IT MATTER WHERE?! AS LONG AS WE ARE TOGETHER!

9.  I don't remember if I had said this before or not but I got the results back from the English competency test I took a few weeks back.  I actually got the result last week I think.  Or the week before.  I don't know.  I can't remember.  Anyways!  I got a 94% lol I AM A GENIUS.  Of course I had to ask what my brother and sister got and they did alright too.  They were in the 80's so HAH!  I WIN.  Did I say I was a genius?!

10.  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand I got sick.  Pffff.  Why do I always get sick during the holidays?!  This is why I have sick leave at work!  To get sick during work days!  :<

I guess that's all.  If I write anymore, I don't know if Reddit Diary can take it!  So I will stop here.  I have to go to bed soon for work tomorrow.  

I'm sorry there's like a lot of shouting in this entry, Reddit Diary!  I just had so much fun and awesomeness and excitement that I just want you to feel it too!  

I apologize in advance for any more of my shouting :)

Goodnight!"
"Dear Reddit Diary,


I work with two old Chinese ladies who whenever they see a cute young guy talking to me at work, they'll say, ""Who is that?  Number 1, 2, 3, on 5 now?""


I just laugh so bad and say, ""No, no, no, only work friends.""


Recently, I'm not sure if this one dude K likes me now.  He's in my same department corner but works second shift...so once again if anything were to happen, I'd have to tolerate only seeing him once or twice on the weekends...


I'm going to mention his age 19 -- at least it's a little better because he's got his own apartment with 3 to 4 roommates and doesn't live far away like Chico does.  Chico has to take the shuttle to get to work.  I think K drives and has it going on, going to college and working 60 hours a week!


The first day K started talking to me, I tried to ask for K's Snap Chat but he didn't give it to me...I wonder if it's because we just started talking and he didn't know me yet.  Anyhow, every day since then, he's been saying hi to me and we'd have conversations in passing.


I wonder if he likes me or if he's just being nice to me...I really can't tell with K.  Every time I want to talk things out with Chico, K shows up and it's like maybe I should forget Chico.  Chico is 18, and doesn't have his own place like K does...plus Chico is kind of far, too even though we work together.


#FUCK


Then again, I don't know if any of them like me.  I've decided to play it cool with them all and keep it as work friends for now.  If they're interested as more, they'll be the ones to come up to me.


I feel like K likes me because he does go out of his way to talk to me, but then he didn't give me his Snap Chat, so the hell?  I keep telling myself it's only because he just started talking to me that day and hasn't gotten a feel for me yet.


K is super hot...his laugh makes me want to grab him and F him right then and there...Chico's laugh is adorable and makes me wanna cuddle him, but K is pure physical.  They're both Mexicans who look white.  I think they're mixed.


I'm almost tempted to tell K, I can't tell him funny things any more because every time he laughs it just turns me on a lot, ugh...but I don't want to come off as a slut to either of them so I'm trying to have the jokes be innocent, Lol.


Signed,


Having Fun Talking"
"I've been thinking about what I want my dream house to be like. The more I thought about it the more I realized that I don't really care much about the house itself at all. What is essential is a large garage/makerspace and a nicely sized temperature controlled greenhouse out back. A secluded back yard would be nice to be able to practice my throwing without judgement from the neighbors haha

I think the only thing I'm really sweet on for my future house is space  inside for a large aquarium and copious amounts of adorable plants. But I think that's about. A play room for me and future hubs would be nice too but I feel like that's asking for a lot. A girl can dream though <3

I'm so undecided about my NYE plans. There is so much going on that I can't decide what to go to. Not to mention my top plan is almost an hour away. Sounds super fun but that is a long ass drive to make alone. I may just lay around and enjoy the last few days of freedom. Choices, choices. "
"Dear Reddit Diary,

I liked how last time I wrote in points so I think I will do that again.  Just quick and straight to the point.

1.  Last night I dreamt of my late grandmother.  The only reason I remember this (I forget about 99% of my dreams unless I promptly write them down like that one time I once had of a girl with a mechanical vagina lololol) was because I woke up in the middle of the night in tears.  I had literally cried in my sleep and was gasping for air because I couldn't breathe.  The last time this happened was when I dreamt of my late grandfather.  I don't know if this is common or not but I did have a hard time going back to sleep.

2.  I have been very hardworking the past week at work.  Maybe not as much as I used to be but way more than I have the past month.  I like to think that as a good thing.

3.  There was a feast at work to celebrate the upcoming holidays so, yay!  Free food!  

4.  Although it's the rainy season, it hasn't rained much this week so no floods.  Yet.  I am hoping there will be no floods this time.

5.  Sooooooo tomorrow is public holiday!  Woooooooooooo!

6.  Friday is Christmas so ANOTHER public holiday!  Wooooooooooo!

7.  I will be going to the bookstore across the border tomorrow just because I can and I want to so I need to remember my passport!

8.  I want to have a BBQ.  Just for me.  I don't want people.  They'll eat all the good stuff.

So yea, this week has been alright.  Pretty much one of the best weeks so far I have had in a while.  I think that's mainly 'cause of the long weekend ahead lol

Goodnight, Reddit Diary!

"Dear Diary,

Yesterday, I received a horrible message from Ex (no longer (former) Boyfriend). Ex was pretty awful and it's pushed me to a new low point. I don't know how I'm going to recover from this. I'm in the darkest place I think I've ever actually been.

I planned my suicide. I want to do it. I might do it. I have a ridiculously small kitchen. I'm going to go into it and turn the gas on for an hour with the door shut. I'm going to take my sleeping medication and hold my breath until I get in there. The gas should be concentrated enough to kill myself. I'll pass out and die of asphyxiation. Everything will finally be over. I never have to live with any of the burdens again. 

I've been through a lot in the nearly 26 years I've lived. When I was little, my dad was a drunk. He was verbally abusive. After he filed a false restraining order against my mom, my mom took him to court. He tried to trade me for Mom's car. My mom got custody. Dad did a lot of awful things to Mom and me. Then, one night, my brother was there and beat the shit out of him. Blood everywhere. Dad kicked my dog and killed her too.

He went to prison when I was like, 13...? For manufacturing meth. He swears it was all his wife's doing, that she was the one doing everything. But I don't believe it. He was at least smoking what she was making and he deserved to go to prison. When he got out, he was a dad that I could be proud of. Those were a nice two years. Then he started drinking again and one thing led to another. In October, he sold my grandparent's house for drug money. I never want anything to do with him again. 

My dad isn't my only shitty family member. My sister just had her seventh child while in prison herself (for fraud, or for drugs, or for stabbing her oldest son? I don't know, one of those things probably). And my other siblings are all working on drinking themselves to death. Three of them are racist, bigoted pigs. I hate listening to them. The only person in my family I have any respect for is my mother. I love her. She's probably the biggest reason that I won't go through with this. Not really. I talk a big game, but I care too much about others to do it. 

You'd think that because I had a super shitty childhood due to all the family drama and drinking, that'd be it. But no. My older nephew molested me when I was 14. You'd think think that'd be it, right? No. 

I was raped when I was 17 by my first ex boyfriend. And then we broke up and got back together so many times because he couldn't live without me. But, after we got out on our own, he started becoming verbally abusive. He told me I was fat and ugly everyday. He made sure that I felt worthless and manipulated me into thinking that I needed him. He cheated on me. And he raped me again and again. I was raped by two other guys---one date rape and one that I was pressured into by a friend. I was backed into a corner and just cried while he did it. 

After everything that I've been through, you'd think that the universe would've had enough with torturing me.

I thought Ex would be the one. My oldest brother is twenty years older than me. His youngest brother is twenty years younger than him. We have mirroring fears (e.g., I was afraid that I would die early and that my husband wouldn't know how to braid our daughter's hair and he has always been afraid his wife was going to die early). We always were on the same wavelength with thoughts---it was weird. We could almost read each other's minds. We'd have similar dreams and wake up and exchange them if they were particularly interesting. I was sexually abused and thought love came from sex. He was afraid of being touched. We healed each other in this aspect. There were so many things that made me think he was the one and now, I feel like it's all my fault after the message he sent.

I feel worthless. I'm trapped in the dark and I can't find any light.

-Stranded"
"Dear Reddit Diary,


I thought Chico and I had a really great time yesterday at work joking and laughing. A week before we added each other on snap chat...now I see he's removed me so I can't see his stories. I really think he removed me because he didn't want me to see his stories about him smoking weed, etc. and stuff that's all it is, but then what does that mean in person, do I go up to him and still say something?


I work with some of his family members so I still have to stay professional with his family members, but I guess I just ignore him, right? Or should I see if he still comes up to me even if he's removed me from snap chat?


Usually if someone doesn't want to add me on social media, I take that as a sign they wouldn't want to talk to me in person, either.


I had a feeling this might happen that he doesn't want me to view his stories. I always thought he was this innocent kid who barely spoke, but I see another side of him now in the snap chat stories and maybe he didn't want me to see that. I had a completely different image of him in person before I saw his stories.


I really thought he was this quiet kid who goes to work and stays in his room...but after work he goes smoking and does lord knows what else.


I was hoping Chico wouldn't let the age differences get to him and still talk to me, but for whatever reason, I think what he did was the best, anyway.  Now I'm back to not crushing on anyone.  It sucks.  I don't know what to do with myself when there's no one to like and think about, ha.


And I don't want to go back to thinking about H who really broke me.  I don't know what we would say to each other even if H did suddenly appear out of nowhere after realizing hard core he did mess up.  I don't know what I would say to H if that happened, either.


I guess I would say, ""Why should I even give you one more chance after what you did?  Do you realize what you did to me?  I thought you were going to be the one to save me so I wouldn't have to keep meeting new assholes and new dead ends.  I thought it would always be you, and you're just like the rest of them that I met.""


It gets boring just being work about work...but because some of Chico's family members are big bosses, I know to stay away and not talk to him.  I'm not going to lose my job over an 18-year-old kid, for Pete's sake.


And I didn't say anything incriminating at all in the snap chats he had of mine...it was all about work.  Everything I said was in person, and no witnesses, but even if there were, they all thought it was funny.


Signed,

Bummed


P.S.  I don't know what I did in life, but I'm tired of always getting the short end of the stick in relationships.  It's not that I don't try - I do try whenever opportunities present themselves and I'm sick of things never working out.  The next new person I meet I want to say why should I even give you a chance?  All the others I've given chances have never worked, what makes a new person any different?  Tired of people just wasting my time.


tl;dr I want my family I'm never going to have."
"Dear Reddit Diary,


Today, I had a wonderful day joking with Chico, new friends and old friends.  I couldn't resist and made a few ""that's what she said"" type jokes, without saying ""that's what she said.""


Chico was holding his sides and couldn't stand up straight from laughing so hard.  I think I delivered some flirty lines really well, without coming on too strong, and even if I did come off kind of strong, the way I said it was too hilarious for him to be creeped out by it.


For example, this other girl we were working with asked if I had any candy because she said she liked sucking on things while she was working.


I answered, ""That's the one thing I don't have in my pockets...but I know what you mean...I like sucking on things, too. Mmmmm MMMMM.""  


I eye Chico up and down.  He giggled so badly.


That started it all.


And then, once we got done inspecting parts, since he's still new, I hold out the defective part and asked him, ""Do you know how to wrap it?""  


I stiffed a giggle after realizing how it sounded.


He fell down and said, ""I'm done.""


Then the girl next to us said, ""Did you realize how you answered her question?  That didn't help any.""


I continue to ask the 18-year-old, ""Boy, what do you know about wrapping it?  That's right what I said, though - wrap it.""  


I was still holding the defective piece.


He had to stop for a few moments and went over to his uncle to tell his uncle and their other friend what I've been saying to him all afternoon.  I saw them three off in the distance laughing so hard so I knew Chico was talking about me to them.


I thought I heard his uncle say, ""Oh my God...she [meaning me] wants you so bad.""  


His uncle is closer to my age than Chico, LOLOL.  I still find the whole age thing funny, but his uncle is in support of me and Chico.


Damn it, Chico...I hope he asks me out on a date soon.  My hints can't get any stronger than these jokes but then again he might think I'm joking...so I decided to post some Snap Chat vlogs saying how I like talking to a new friend but I don't want to ask him out because of our age differences and other things so I keep it as friends.  I hope that he will find out from mutual people we know and ask me instead if he is interested.


I feel like Chico might be intimidated by my age.  All I hope is that he'll keep talking to me whenever we work so we can continue to get to know each other and he'll see the age thing won't really matter.


Chico viewed my snap chat stories once, but I don't know if he's going to listen to the vLogs that I posted.  


Signed,


Hopeful


tl;dr  I hope Chico's uncle continues to put in a word for me...his uncle who is closer to my age than Chico, lmao...Chico's uncle has kids even though he's younger than me, too, but I'm not really attracted to Chico's uncle.  I think it's Chico's laugh as to why I'm attracted to Chico despite him being 18."
"Dear Reddit Diary,


I am so freaking glad I kept my mouth shut and didn't say anything to the 18-year-old about him supposedly not wanting to talk to me.  I just kept telling myself wait until the morning and see what happens.


With my phone conversation last night to my 2nd shift elder friend who I will call B, I was complaining to him how guys always are into me the first few days they talk to me then they stop talking to me out of nowhere and don't tell me why.  I am so sick of this.  At this point I haven't done anything crazy so, yeah...


I'll call the Spanish/Mexican 18-year-old, ""Chico.""  Maybe I will have better luck with this guy because he isn't a white guy.  Most of the white guys are the ones to not date me and not be friends with me for some reason, but if I talk to non-whites, they at least are friends.


On the phone I say to my friend B, ""What the F, I thought Chico liked talking to me.""


B tries to calm me down and says, ""Don't worry, maybe sometimes people just get tired from working and they are busy and will talk to you.""


I was two seconds away to pouring my heart out to Chico about how I like him [can't stand it when he laughs because that's what I like about him] and maybe it's for the best he stopped talking to me like that, but then I'm like this never works, and wtf, I just wanted to talk to him as a friend.


I answer back to B on the phone, ""I sure hope you're right that Chico is just tired.  He also recently switched shifts to my shift, too.""


So morning comes.  I see a familiar boy wearing a baseball cap and his winter coat on about to punch in.  I keep my head down a bit, waiting for the day to start, just staring at him and the floor to see if he would notice me.


He turns around after he punches in, nods in my direction walks over and stands next to me and starts talking to me.  What a nice surprise.  So maybe he was tired after all.  I still don't get why he hasn't read my snap chat message yet.  He's on it all the time.


Chico works in a different department than me and his uncle.


Anyway, because I was bored and wanted to make small talk at work to have the day pass by, I ended up confessing to Chico's Uncle I like his 18-year-old nephew.  I was really surprised by his uncle's support.


In fact, Uncle didn't seem too bothered by the 11-year age gap with me and Chico.  I'm even older than Chico's uncle and he was all saying go for his nephew he might say yes, LOL.  I assume that means his nephew is single.


I was cracking jokes to Chico's uncle all day about Chico.  Since this is Chico's first week, he hasn't gotten paid yet and they were talking about Chico's first pay check.


I told the uncle, ""Chico told me that he would take me out on a $100 date with his first pay check.""  [Chico never said that of course.]  The uncle was rolling.


I then hesitate and say, ""You're not going to tell him what I said are you?  He might get mad at me.""


The uncle replies, ""Oh, no he won't get mad at you.""
----


A few moments later I tell uncle I saw Chico on break in the break room.  I ignored him and he walked by me twice.  I then asked if the uncle said anything to him about my comment and he said maybe.


I'm like, ""OMG, what did Chico say about that?""


Uncle says, ""He just started bursting out laughing and was like what?! And kept laughing.""


Uncle was talking more about his other family working there, too besides Chico.


I say, ""I'm family, too, you know.  Chico is my baby daddy.  Now he's really going to kill me for this comment.""


The uncle just looked at me and realized what I said, then burst out laughing, too.  So did the other girl who knows Chico.


Uncle replies, ""Hey you never know.  Chico, just might accept being the baby daddy.  I would have an Asian baby niece.""


I laugh and say, ""Yep.""


At the end of the day, I stand by the door to wait for my mom to come pick me up.  A few minutes later Chico and his uncle walk past me.


Chico stops for a minute and says bye to me personally.  The way he said bye to me, was like in a flirty way.  I said bye back.


So things are good with him!  And now Chico knows I'm into him and with a word from his uncle maybe something might happen!


I really don't care if Chico is 18.  I just want to hang out with someone even as just friends.  I see nothing wrong with that no matter what age -- provided everyone's of legal age of course.  If it happens to be more, Chico will be the one to say it.


Signed,


Relieved.


tl;dr  Thought Chico was ignoring me, but it turns out maybe he was just tired because he started talking to me again.  With the help of a word from his uncle, maybe something might happen after all!"
"Dear Reddit Diary,

How have you been?  I know a diary is where you talk about yourself and how you're feeling, what you've been up to, a funny story here and there so I'm curious.  If my diary were to come to life, I wonder what it would say to me?  Like, what comments would it throw in here and there.  It just got me thinking that.  A living diary.  

Of course, it could all end badly lol But I would just like to say how much I appreciate you, Reddit Diary.  It's a fun thing we're doing this you and I.

So ok moving on!  

I had dinner with a couple of friends on Thursday.  It was nice to catch up with them.  One is getting married next year and the other is going to grad school.  Unless she decides to not go but for now, she said she's going.  They made me help them shop.  Ugh.  I really don't shop.  Like, I don't understand.  My brain is incapable of understanding this shopping thing.  Like, I don't mind shopping for gifts and for others but this was more like makeup/accessories/nails/hair stuff kinda shop and I really don't know much or if anything at all about that stuff.  I told them if they were planning on doing that shopping then I would stop by the book or toy store.  

They said no.  

Pfff.  

They said this is what it means to be a girl.  

PFFFFF.  

Does it really?  Because I've got a vagina, society dictates that I must get all dressed up and buy all this expensive stuff and walk and dress and talk a certain way?  If that's really what being a girl is then pass.  Almost every female I know loves to do all this except me and I honestly am not bothered by it.  It takes too much effort and I don't like having to spend soooooo long on getting dolled up.  The time it takes does not appeal to me even though I have been told that the better you get, the faster you can do it but still.  I don't like it.  I know people who love getting dolled up and spend hours on it.  I have even waited for them and really, the time it takes is just not appealing.  At all.  Even if it's not me that's doing it.  I just have no interest in that sort of thing.

People do say to me that I should pamper myself once in a while and I'd look really good but then they say they understand it's not for me and that they like to tease me about it 'cause I have ""funny comments"" on that kinda stuff.  lol I don't know.  It doesn't really bother me that they tease me about that stuff but should it bother me?  Is it really something I have to bother about?  I have done the whole pampering thing and I admit, it is nice but I don't feel like me.  Is it 'cause I don't do it on a regular basis?  'Cause I am just not used to wearing makeup and heels all day?

Ugh ok.  Next topic.

I spent this weekend mostly watching movies.  Catching up on ones that I missed.  I didn't really do anything ""productive.""  Although, I did go to the city again on Saturday.  Mum and Dad are renovating my sister's house so me and my youngest sister tagged along while they shopped for tiles and looked at furniture.  You know, all that new house stuff.  Spent most of Saturday out and only watched the movies when I got home with my youngest sister.  Brother didn't want to join us 'cause he's lazy lol Oh well.

Sunday was another movie day.  And also a nice relaxing day.  I think it's the first time in weeks since I was able to seep in.  So that was really nice.  I didn't do anything else.  Except Hearthstone lol I think it's now safe to assume I play it everyday for like a couple of hours.  Would be nice to play with someone once in a while though.  Oh well.

So yea, I think I'll end here.  Nothing else to report.  I hope you've been well, Reddit Diary!  I'll see you on Wednesday!

Goodnight!"
"Dear Reddit Diary,


So Attention Whore girl at work, I heard her talking crap about me and the boss liking each other.  She said this to other people around us, ""OP can have him, I have a boyfriend remember?""  She really doesn't want to be having my name in her mouth talking crap because I'll tell her a thing or two about how she comes off if she's really that oblivious to herself...but because it is work, I'm trying to be professional about it and just ignoring her.  And she is saying stuff about me to where I can actually hear her talking about me.  Maybe she wouldn't care about what my name is if she wasn't so obsessed with hearing to see if the boss is coming around to get confused about me and him having the same name.


I'm not gonna let some big flirt with a boyfriend not at work bother me when I don't even really want anyone at work.  I joke with people about stuff, but I don't act like her hugging on people and stuff all the time...and I wouldn't act like that especially if I had a boyfriend.  I just started to like the boss to entertain myself because the love of my life in the city isn't talking to me and I have no idea if he ever will again.  


Attention Whore isn't even worth to tell off.  Seriously, a girl who has a boyfriend is trying to cause problems with me and the boss at work?  I'm not having any of it.  If she has a boyfriend she shouldn't be hanging all over the boss in the first place.


And I wanted to tell her, ""If you have a boyfriend why are you always trying to sneak the same breaks with the boss?  Shouldn't you be texting your freaking boyfriend?""  Oh, and I heard her sister may be hired on Monday so now there will be two of those possible Attention Whores there, oh lord.  I hope her sister is nothing like her...


I noticed today how the boss has been avoiding Attention Whore on breaks to where she invites herself to sit down with him, and he has actually been noticing me lately, especially today, lol.  I knew he was looking at me because I was looking right back at him.


Whenever team lead would pass my station, he'd always be doing something to acknowledge me as if he was checking me out and stuff.  I think he knows I like him but I don't know if he likes me.


At my new department, there's this guy, ""Billy,"" and we always talk to each other about our relationship problems.  I told him about my friend in the city who isn't talking to me.


Billy says, ""Did you tell your friend that there are loads of guys at work who would love to take you out on a date?""


I gushed and said, ""Yeah!  I told him.  He still isn't talking to me.  I don't get him...who stays on the phone with me for three hours totaling the few different days we talked, drives an hour and back to see me, pays $400 on me so we can have a good time in the city...and then doesn't make it official with me...does that freaking make sense?""


Billy says, ""Hell, no.  I have no idea what his problem is.""


I answer, ""I know what it is.  It's because he can't see me as much as he'd like to.  We don't even have a night to where we can spend with each other because I work Saturdays now, too.  I'd have the weekend off all together if I knew he would make time for me.  I purposely work this much to distract myself from wanting to say something to him.""


I don't like sitting at home thinking about the love of my life when he isn't talking to me so I find things to do.  If he would shape up, I would take weekends off to visit him.


Signed,

Irritated


tl;dr An Attention Whore with a boyfriend who doesn't work there is trying to stir up drama when she shouldn't even be having any since she has a boyfriend and shouldn't be wondering what I'm doing or who I'm talking to or who is talking to me.  I don't want anyone at work but because the love of my life isn't talking to me, I have no choice but to try and talk to guys in my town.  I'm not dealing with this crap at work, hell no.  I'm there to work and talk to the friends I do like that I have there."
"Dear Reddit Diary,

Since I can't have my friend H who I have always wanted, I have no choice but to talk to the people who are in my town.  So things have finally progressed a little bit with me and boss man...The thing with boss man is, girls always throw themselves all over him at work and I roll my eyes.  Don't know whether or not he flirts back, but they're definitely on him.  I think people are trying to get me to admit whether or not I like the boss man because I don't make it too obvious.  I'll joke with him, but it could mean nothing at the same time.


So today, we were talking about people with big hands and big feet and I was joking to this dude at work saying I have big hands and big feet...but it doesn't mean anything since I'm a girl.  This new guy pulls C over who is pretty close with the boss and he told C how I like guys with big hands and big feet, and I go that is totally not what I said...


Then C calls boss man over and asks him, ""Hey, what size shoe do you wear?""


Boss man answers, ""9 and a half.""


Omg, I giggled so much.  And another time, when this other girl and I were working together and the boss man comes over, we were speaking in different languages on what words mean and she asked me if I think boss man is guapo.  Then she says, I know what she's talking about but I didn't say anything.


I wonder if he's getting these people to see if I like him or not since I don't throw myself shamelessly at him.  I told this old lady I was talking to I keep work about work and I'm not going to be like those other girls.


She goes, ""That's right.  No need to be like that.""


I asked her if I make my crush obvious on the boss man, and she says no I don't, lol.  I think he over heard our conversation because now he's acting really shy around me.  I'm not going to say anything directly to him.  All I can do is say things for him to over hear to find out whether or not he likes me.


Signed,


Keeping work about work


tl;dr  So I think the team lead knows now I like him but I'm keeping work about work, also because I don't know if he likes me and I'm not going to be stupid about it."
"Dear Reddit Diary,

Ok so, I don't think this is gonna be a long entry but who knows.

Aaaaaaaaaanyways, Friday I took a day trip and crossed the border.  I took the day off work and Mum and I spent the day ""overseas"" with my aunt.  I actually just wanted to go the bookstore lol And I may or may not have overspent but it's ok!  It was all worth!  

lol well I think it was all worth

I bought 8 books.  Most were under the Scifi/Fantasy department with maybe a couple of horror/thriller.  Ugh.  I really should stop but I can't!  If I see a book, I just need to go to it and be amazed at it and just buy it lol Plus there was a 20% off EVERYTHING and Mum's a member so there's another 10% so why not?!  I bought some art supplies too.  Paint, paper, brushes among some of them.  I think I'll be ok until January.  I will stop until I go to Singapore.  The bookstore there.  IS EVEN BETTER.  AND HAS MORE.  IS JUST ABSOLUTE HEAVEN.  I should build myself a bookshelf!  All my books are all over the place.  Meh.

Saturday Mum, Dad and I went to the city.  We went to this shop that sells PC parts but I wasn't planning on buying anything yet so I just asked around a bit and what they had to offer and all that.  I'm probably going back in the next two weeks.  Gotta wait for that paycheck.  And that Christmas bonus!  

Maybe I can get Mum and Dad to pay for me ahaha

The owner did ask what my budget was and I asked Mum and Dad what my budget was lol They said it was my money and my decision but I wasn't sure what a reasonable price would be.  He said he could get me a quotation based on what I want to use it for and it could be for $1000 or less if I'm on a tight budget so that's good to hear.  Dad was like a kid.  He was so amazed and in awe at everything so I thought he was gonna build one but he said no lol Oh well.  If he was gonna build one, I could just use his!  lol nah I want mine to look AWESOME.  MONEY IS NOT A PROBLEM.  JUST GIVE ME THE MOST EXPENSIVE OF EVERYTHING.

lol I'm kidding, Reddit Diary.  I'm not gonna splurge so much on a new PC.  All that good moolah is for something else!

So yea, nothing much else.  I drew a bit.  Tried some painting/colouring methods I haven't tried before.  Played Hearthstone.  Watched Shrek 1,2,3 & 4.  Watched Stardust.  Ate jelly.  Had my juice box.  Cuddled my cats.  Just usual stuff.  

Guess that's it.  I've got work tomorrow so I'm gonna go to bed now.  Dad's got the week off.  Pfsh.  That man has so many days to clear.  Since when was he a workaholic?!  Oh, maybe I can get him and Mum to go to the city and just buy the parts for me and I'll pay them back!  lol nah.  They wouldn't like that idea very much.  I'll just wait till my Christmas bonus comes in!

Goodnight, Reddit Diary!"
"Dear Reddit Diary,


Note: This could be long because lots have been happening!  


I have told myself over and over don't date people in the same department as me or at work, but at least I've been moved to work on another project to where I don't see my two crushes anymore but in passing.


I'm on my way to where I want to be.  Everything in my life is going great...well almost everything.  The one thing I can't seem to get a steady beat going is with a dude, but for now, College Boy is still in the picture!  I don't know about H.  Work is overall good (at least I'm doing my job, anyway.)


Everyone who talks to me at work all say I'm a funny girl and they like talking with me.  I often get, ""quite the character"" -- in good and bad ways, but mostly good, ha.  My team lead who has the same name as me (but the boy version spelling) says I'm a natural born comedian.  Things have progressed with him as well.  I finally got his phone number, too, after like almost a month of working there.  I kept telling myself I'm only going to use it for work purposes, lol.  And if he wants anything more he'll initiate it.


It's worked with College Boy being distant but dropping signals, and I hope if I keep on being the funny girl that I am always making my team lead laugh with my jokes, hopefully team lead will just finally ask me to hang out.


I've been wanting to ask for my team lead's # for the longest time, but I'm trying to be professional about it, and with the thing happening with College Boy, it's just a huge secret mess.  It's so awkward seeing the both of them work together and I like them both.


Everyone's keeping things professional at work and they don't know about each other, but then again nothing has happened with me and my team lead besides joking around and flirting.  I could see a future with my team lead since he is in his 30s and more around my age, on the same page as me than college boy, but since team lead hasn't showed any signs of wanting anything outside of work, I'm not going to bring it up first and make a fool of myself.


Since College Boy is the only one who has hung out with me outside of work, I just decided to see what happens with him.


I wish H had a chance like this to really talk to me in person daily.  H lives in the city and I live in a small town, about an hour away we don't really get to properly hang out with me and him working 12 hours a day 6 days a week.  Because we can't see each other often in person if at all, H doesn't get to experience this ball of awesomeness.


I can't do anything about my childhood friend, H -- the truest love of my life.  I have told him everything I possibly could:  I said the worst thing he can do to himself is marry someone he doesn't love.  I mean, he almost did ask the girl he was with for a year to marry him but he didn't.  This was when we were far away thinking we would never meet.


I don't know why H would just give up on me and him right now when we've waited our entire lives for this!  I don't know how to get through to his brain anymore...Perhaps H actually does have to marry someone he doesn't love firsthand since he doesn't want to step up now.  He dodged a bullet on that a long time ago, but he's too prideful to apologize to me so we can finally progress.


God gave H another chance to do things right with me...and H is messing up so badly right now to the point where I don't know what to do.  Since he doesn't want to talk to me, I just have to entertain myself with College Boy and team lead at work - someone I can see daily, touch, and talk to whenever the person talks to me.


So things FINALLY happened with College Boy!  After like a week of awkward No Contact at work, College Boy finally Snap chatted me on Tuesday [that's after I posted a cute Snap Chat pic of myself which I knew would catch his attention] asking me if I wanted to ""hang out"" for five minutes before he went to class after work because that's all the time he had.  So I did...and I gave him a hand job, Lol!  


In College Boy's car, we talked about not talking at work and keeping it as it is, and he said good job with that.  So even if things don't work out, at least we can keep it professional.


We can really deny it at work since we don't even associate with each other in person there.  College Boy used to in the beginning would sit with me at breaks and talk, then something happened for a week to where we would ignore each other and he went out of his way to ignore me, and avoided where I was sitting.


And now, College boy is finally sitting next to me, at the same table as me, but not saying anything to me.  Today out of nowhere after not speaking to me at all since we hung out Tuesday - three days later, College Boy surprisingly plops down at the seat next to me on my left.


I decided to take a snap chat picture of the muffin I was eating not paying any attention to him.  A few seconds later I heard him giggle.  And I look at who viewed my snap stories, he just viewed it.  So silly, right next to me, won't say anything to me, but views my snap chat stories I post.  And I even saw him glancing at me eating the muffin while I was taking the picture.


I enjoy this innocent carefree playfulness with College Boy, but it eats at me knowing nothing more will probably happen with him...he's a hot mess with his emotions, we're not on the same page in life, and it just isn't going to work.  It's okay to flirt for now with occasional hand jobs and not expecting anything more.  I know he wants to date me -- he proved that by the week we ignored each other and I backed away from him doing my thing he couldn't resist me anymore, but doesn't date me because of our age differences and how I might even move in the near future, too.


Done being loyal to a guy since the ones I find don't appreciate a woman who only hooks up with the one person I'm into at a time (whoever it is).  I'm gonna be single and I'm gonna flirt.  It feels good, but I do wish I could tell people I'm happily in love with a man who feels the same and we're married, ugh.


With College Boy, he just posted a snap story of hanging out with his girlfriend on Sunday and then he asks to hang out with me on Tuesday.  I was confused.  I thought he was still with his girlfriend...or maybe they aren't official I don't know.  They've been together for 3.5 years, so I'm sure it's hard for him to end it altogether and that's why I'm not going up to him.


Today at work, I was laughing at a conversation I was having.  Here I am a small Asian girl, chatting with three to four tall black dudes about me wanting ten kids with my childhood friend H.  I also told the black dudes about my car accidents I had this past year (my first one in my entire life which is why I wanted to move to the west coast away from the bad weather in the Midwest).


The black dudes made jokes saying, ""We can already tell you're a bad driver just by looking at you.""


I laughed and said back, ""Excuse me?  I can tell that ya'll like watermelon, fried chicken, and kool-aid just by looking at YOU.""


Black guy:  Who told you all black people like that?


Me:  I saw this thing on You Tube.


Black guy:  You shouldn't believe everything you see on the Internet.  But you did tell us yourself you got into a car accident so you are a  bad driver.


Me:  That was my first accident all these years, lol.  I had the same car for 13 years and it only stopped working because it got old, whatever, ha.


-Back to the conversation about H


Black Guy:  So have you been sending any more messages to your friend, H? You did tell me you do every day.


Me:  Yeah.  I mean normally, if it was a guy I just met and it didn't work out, I'd drop the dude...but this is my friend I've been longing for my entire life who is now near me after being 10,000 miles away for nearly twenty years.  I've been having a hard time letting go because this is the guy I want to have my kids with and I'm also saying goodbye to my future unconvinced children!  I'm never having kids because I can't trust any guy I meet.


Black Guy:  Come now, there are billions of people in this world to be stuck on one.


Me:  I know...that's what I keep trying to preach to myself now, especially when I've moved to a state with lots more people around my age who are single.  I remember this phone conversation I had with H once.


[H:  Will you freaking stop blowing up my phone?  Stop messaging me.  I can't even charge my phone because of all your messages.


Me:  I want to stop messaging you but I can't and I don't know why.  I don't even want to date you, either right now when you aren't respecting me.]


The Black Guys are rolling at the conversations I tell them I have with H.  Even when I'm mad as hell at H he makes me laugh.


Signed,

Trying to Enjoy life without H in it



tl;dr  I'm not going to go up to College Boy since I don't know if he is truly broken up with his girlfriend or not, but I will respond to him if he messages me first.  Seems like me not initiating anything has been working!  I don't know what to do about H but nothing for the time being since nothing can be done since he doesn't want to hang out or talk to me.  I finally got my cutiepatootie team lead's number but am being professional about anything more since I'm trying to keep work about work and not letting personal feelings interfere."
"Dear Reddit Diary,


It turns out, after nearly twenty years, I was the only one in the friendship who had hoped for it to be something more if we ever had the opportunity.  Tonight, I finally talked to my dream in real life over the phone.


My online Internet, childhood friend who I finally met in person as young adults, doesn't believe me that I've been waiting for him all these years thinking we'd never meet when we were far away.  We just ""lucked out"" that we're both still single and in the same area.  No, I really was waiting for him.  I told him before it freaked me out that we actually got to meet in person and I always had a feeling we would meet but I knew when we were older and could do what we wanted as young adults and not have to get our parents' permissions.  


I wish we would have met as children when we first started talking online, so at least I would have known then if it would have worked out or not...but I didn't see our parents giving us permission to meet an online friend who lives far away.  They'd be monitoring us every minute of the day as 13 and 14-year-olds.


He questions why I've never been in an actual relationship with someone and I told him it's because I was thinking of him all this time far away and I wasn't into anyone nearby for it to ever last.  He doesn't get it.  I always pushed, and pushed the guys I liked nearby me to where it scared them away I just wanted to forget my far away friend so badly I thought I would never meet him and that I was only dreaming that I would get to meet him...but because I became obsessive about my nearby crushes, they didn't like me back.  I didn't know what to do.


I keep telling myself why do I want a friend who lies to himself and to me about our friendship, about ""what we had/didn't have.""  I don't want him, but I do...if that makes sense.


I told him when he didn't talk to me as soon as I flew back to my old hometown, it looked like he just thought of me as a hook-up and didn't care about the number of years we talked.  He said in a sad voice that wasn't true and he had his reasoning for doing that...partly because I was going to move there in a few months anyway and we would talk when I got here, he says.  Still, it made me feel like I was just a hook up when he didn't talk to me at all before I moved here.


I said things would have been so different if I never hooked up with him the first day we met in person, but I didn't know if I would ever see him again or if I would even move here at all so that's why I gave it up just like that.

He says I can't predict what would have happened because it's already happened and not in that way.  I told him I know exactly what would have happened: he would still be wondering what I'm like hooking up had we not hooked up too soon and he would still be talking to me.


I've been right about everything so far how he would act after I got back to my old hometown, and after I moved here...the only thing I was wrong about was that I thought he was always The One for me.  I'm not surprised we are at where we're at...whether or not I blew up his phone.


Signed,

Confused

 


tl;dr Thought a so-called ""friend"" would give this more of a chance since we talked all these years. I didn't think he'd make a ""decision"" in one day.  He gave more of a chance to someone he met just last year over someone he's talked to online all these years.  Oh well, life is never fair."
"My friend says a change in scenery will help. I think so too. I have more haunting me here that anyone.

Packing is another thing entirely. I can sympathize with hoarders but I don't have the luxury of a stable living environment.

It's the little things. So many little things. It's hard to throw away a doodle on the back of an envelope. There's a little foam leaf wreath I made last Thanksgiving, in '14, that is just a painful reminder but I don't want to get rid of it. It's literally grade-school crafts and has no value, style, taste, or anything.

But it says what I was thankful for. It talk about the life I was living. The dog. Her.

I don't even see her as some disembodied thing, like a shadow in the sky. It's just, *more* than I've ever had with another person. She's both a person and a huge event in my life. It's hard for me to wrap my head around. Much less my heart.

Yet, the reality is, she didn't come to that Thanksgiving. She was busy or just didn't want to go. Even then she was saying ""it's not worth the effort"" in some way or another. The beginning of our end already sewn into the very fabric of us.

The wreath is just sitting on the dresser next to my alarm.

And that's just one bit of what anyone else would say is ""garbage"" in my room.

Bittersweet, poignant little bits of when we were 'we' instead of something less. Maybe I saw more, maybe I ran with something half-baked instead of really looking at it. Maybe I was just her first BF and she didn't know ""like-like"" from ""love."" Maybe we define love differently.

It was real for me. She was the one for me.

Still so much to pack and it keeps all falling out."
"Dear Reddit Diary,

It's been about a month since I started this biweekly entry!  Woo!

It was Dad's birthday on Thursday!  We had cake!  Although I didn't get a chance to eat it but it's the cake we normally get for him every year on his birthday so no biggie.  Plus, I mostly ate Mum's cake last week and the week before so I guess it's justified????  lol moving on!

There was no meeting on Friday!  Wooooo!  I didn't have to stay late!   So I managed to stop over at my paternal grandparent's house.  Stayed a bit.  I was supposed to go over for lunch but you know, stuff happened so I called them and told them I'd drop by after work instead so they wouldn't worry why I wasn't on time for our weekly luncheon.

So, the weekend wasn't as busy as it originally was gonna be.  Didn't end up going to the city.  Mum wasn't gonna go 'cause it was my youngest sister's prom night dance thingie.  Whatever it was.  Anyways!  Mum was gonna stay and help her dress up and do her make up and all that pre-socializing stuff the whole shebang so there wasn't enough time for her to be able to go to the city with me and Dad in the afternoon since her morning was already booked with her friends to celebrate her belated birthday.  

Sooooooooooooooooo long story short, basically Dad didn't want to go without her.  Pfff.  Fiiiiiinnee we'll just go next week then!

I did go and watch Victor Frankenstein with Mum and brother and aunt.  We went while we waited for my youngest sister's party dance thing to be over.  It was pointless to drive all the way back home since it was raining really heavily and the drive would be at least 30 minutes so why not catch a movie while waiting?!  There were other movies (not as much as overseas pfsh) so it was either that or The Good Dinosaur or Mockingjay Part 2 or Spectre.  We already saw Mockingjay Part 2 last week and my aunt already saw Spectre and me or my brother didn't really want to watch The Good Dinosaur so Victor Frankenstein it is!  

Mum and my aunt spent most of the movie covering their eyes.  Mum took it to a whole new level.  She wore sunglasses!  The movie was alright.  It wasn't so bad.  Wasn't so good but I'd watch it again.  Maybe.  Probably on cable lol Then grabbed a bite to eat and honestly, I did not realize how hungry I was!  I don't really eat rice at night.  Maybe a small helping but I finished like one bowl!  I guess I was really hungry lol The food was good too!

Sunday there was a family thing.  Like a memorial day for my late grandmother who just passed away in August.  I don't know what it's called in English but I guess it's like a memorial day.  This is the last one where we invite people over so the next time it will be just family.  

I have started to feel better, Reddit Diary!  I think I was really down the past couple of weeks 'cause I didn't really go running anymore so I felt bad I guess.  So I will start again tomorrow!  I have also started colouring again!  It has cleared my mind so I'm happy about that!  The colours are pretty!

I have work tomorrow and I am not dreading it as much as I normally would.  This week was mostly bad.  So I hope next week will be better!  Fingers crossed!

Goodnight!"
"Dear Reddit Diary,

It was Mum's birthday on Friday but she wasn't around so we only got to celebrate it tonight.  She was on a trip to visit family in a neighbouring country.  It was supposed to be a trip with my late Grandma but she passed just before she could go.  But Mum still wanted to go and she said she feels better going despite Grandma not around anymore.  I guess it brings her a sense of closure since she saw all (I think) of Grandma's family.  Mum's side of the family is just too big for me to even remember who's who.  Grandma's older sister and uncle aren't doing too well but aren't sick.  They just sleep a lot and only wake up to eat.  Grandma's younger sister just got better after being sick.  She looks the most like Grandma.  I was hoping to see her but I didn't go on the trip.  Hopefully I can next time.

Work's been alright.  I'm still in projects.  I've been listening to a lot of Disney on Spotify while working.  I think the stress is starting to get to me so Disney like counters it.  Disney is definitely better than some guilty pleasures I sometimes listen to ahaha 

The new adventure in Hearthstone was released on Thursday!  For obvious reasons, I did play it lol And it was soooooooo fun!  I feel like I'm in an Indiana Jones movie stealing a ancient artifact then I have to protect it and finally escape the cursed temple!  This is, by far, the most fun I have had in Hearthstone in forever!  I hope they keep doing stuff like this as often as possible.  I can't wait for part 2 next week!

I made a video for my sister but have yet to upload it.  I'll do it tomorrow.  Went out yesterday with Dad and brother and other sister.  We watched the world cup qualifier on tv while at the restaurant.  We saw Argentina vs Brazil.  I don't know if it was live or not though lol I was enjoying my food.

Oh, Mum got me a gift from her trip!  It's a snowglobe!  It's Totoro!  She knows I love snowglobes and Studio Ghibli so the two combined is just an added bonus!  The cake we got for Mum was pretty good even though we've never tried the cake before.

I have also been on a Disney movie marathon.  Tarzan, The Rescuers, Goofy Movie, etc.  I think I've seen Mulan like 6 times!  Honestly, I watched it so I could just quote almost every line and sing along to all the songs ahaha I've also been watching Enchanted a lot.  Not as much as Mulan but still.  I think it's 'cause Enchanted was one of the last movies I saw with Grandma.  She loved the movie and the singing was her favourite part.  I miss her.

Yea, ok no mushy stuff.  I don't think I'd be able to control myself if my emotions get the better of me so I'm gonna go to bed.  Work tomorrow.  Meh.  This week wasn't as fast paced as last week so that's good.

Ok, goodnight, Reddit Diary."
"Dear Reddit Diary,

Yesterday marked the one year anniversary of my full time employment at the company I am currently working at. I did work part time before but it didn't feel as much of an accomplishment. I have saved up to my target amount which I honestly did not think was possible in the first year.

I am planning on taking night school next year for a few months. I don't have to but I thought a refresher on the program I use could be of use. Plus there might be some hidden tricks I forgot about. Other than this I don't really have anything planned. 

Besides the flying. There is gonna be A LOT of flying next year so I am excited about that! To 3 different continents I believe. The countries aren't all confirmed yet. I can't wait! I will also be diving! It's summer then so why not? I probably would need a refresher 'cause it'll be more than 6 months but that's fine. Being at a beach reminds me of my late Grandfather. I really miss him.

Today I think I had a bad day at work which resulted in my running longer than I usually do until my feet hurt. I think I have blisters. I'm not so sure. I think this was me beating myself up over a not so good day at work. I really shouldn't do that to myself but how do you stop your subconscious?? I need to remind myself that one bad day is just one. It's not a lifetime. It'll pass.

The new adventure in Hearthstone is gonna be out soon! Some people were lucky to buy them today but I wasn't so I'll just wait till Thursday. It's not that far away either. I think I am addicted to the game. I played it a bit too much today.

I have Mulan on right now. I watched Pocahontas last night but I fell asleep halfway through. I've been having trouble falling sleep lately. Even though I am completely exhausted, I just can't seem to fall asleep until the next hour. All techs are turned off except the tv as white noise. I tried with the tv off but I was up till 1am. Meh I'll just lay down and not move and just wait.

Mum made banana coconut cream pie again! I can't eat it though pfff. She said it needs to ""set"".  Why tell me about it then????? Ugh. I'll eat it for breakfast tomorrow. It's pie. Pie is good for you. I wilk have a good day tomorrow 'cause I had pie for breakfast. Logic!

Ok, this is a really long entry. I'm sorry, Reddit Diary. I wasn't planning on writing this much but I guess my subconscious had other plans. 

I'll see you on Sunday, Reddit Diary! Goodnight!"
"Dear Reddit Diary,


All I wanted to see is if my new co-worker friend lived near me to give me a ride home.

This young looking boy asks me, ""Did you move here to California with your husband?""


He has to be in college.


I answer sadly, ""I don't have a husband.""


""Oh, what do you do in your free time hang out with your boyfriend?""


Damn this kid is slick trying to find out if I am single, so persistent, I quietly laugh. First day at work and I get hit on. I'm not even dressed up. I purposely dressed down so no one would notice me and I still get noticed, ah. I give him a good look, he is cute and talkative. Let's call him, Guy. Do I want to talk to a college boy again? They've been nothing but trouble and games, especially the college boys.
He does in fact live near me and always passes my street on his way to and back from work.


The new Team Lead, let's call him, ""J"" is cute and bubbly, too. All these men at work...then I thought about the nightmare talking to men at work from my old job. They never kept it to themselves and made up rumors and gossip. I don't want to date people from work but all I do is work...although I do have the weekends free to see my friend, H, who is not talking to me.


I have a rule if they work in the same department as me, that's off limits. It would become very awkward if things didn't work out. This place is huge with what seems like 9 billion employees. If someone works at the north corner and I'm at the south and we never see each other at work it's okay...but when two people are next to me all the time, no-no-no!!!


J was front and center, noticeable since the beginning. I bet I'm not the only girl there that has a crush on him. As I watch the other girls around him, damn, all of them are trying to flirt with him, too. I know these girls would be jealous and catty if things ever worked out with J. He's probably with someone he has to be!


Lily a new girl who has been here longer than me jokes with another girl about, J being her man. They want him, too! Ugh.


Lily told the other girl, ""Go ask your man, J, what we should do next after we're done with this project.""


I tried to find out more info about J from Guy himself, trying to not give it away that I Have a crush on J, too.


I ask, ""Do all people here have kids like my old job?""


""Most of them do,"" Guy answers.


""What about that guy and J?""


""No, J doesn't have any kids,"" Guy explains.


Wow, that's good. I don't see a ring on J's finger, either. 
I wonder how old J is. I think he is about my age or a little older.
When J talks to me, I feel like he has a small crush on me, but because he is Team Lead, I try to keep my distance. Am I really starting to move on from my childhood friend, H who hasn't been talking to me now?
J has the same name as me! I've always wanted to date a guy with the same exact name as me -- thought that would be pretty funny and cool at the same time. His is the boy version of the spelling but when pronounced it all sounds the same. Every time someone would say ""my"" name, I'd always turn around but forget he has the same name as me, too.
And I've always wanted to know what it's like to hook up with a young 21-year-old, too, but the ones I met before played too many games, here Guy is trying to give himself to me with no games at all. He saw what he wanted and he is trying to go for it. I have two fantasies of mine standing right here in front of me that could come true...but they both work in the same department as me, ugh, ugh, ugh. So I'm not going to do anything with, J or Guy.


Guy continues to dig for information about me, ""How old are you?""


I answer, ""29.""


""Oh wow, I thought you were about my age,"" Guy says the things that everyone always says about my youthful looks.


I guess, ""What are you 20?""


""No, close,"" Guy says.


""21,"" I nod.


""Yep.""


""I knew it,"" I was right he is in college.


On the way home in the car, we hang out for an hour parked somewhere. Guy felt terrible for me about what H did, but he could do nothing about it.


At that point when Guy tried to lean in to kiss me, I thought about it...really I did...I even felt like I would enjoy it. Guy took my hand and held it for a few minutes...I let him hold my hand, but then I let go when Guy tried to move closer.


Guy is into me, ""So what position do you like?""


Me, ""Anything with someone I love -- that's when it's the best.""


Guy, ""That is good you're waiting for that.""


I tell Guy about the self-esteem issues that my friend H has with his small self.


Guy laughs and says, ""I don't have that problem.""


I answer, ""Well I don't like big Ds. I actually like small ones.""


Guy giggles, ""Really? That's a first I've heard a girl say that.""


""Ha! Are you for real? I am the first girl you heard say that?""


Why is Guy in my life like this? I keep trying to say things to him how I don't want to hook up with him unless I'm in love with him and I'm not in love with Guy. Is he in my life to see if I can kiss someone else other than H?


I picture myself leaning in for a minute, about to kiss Guy, but then I couldn't. I can't betray H who is not talking to me.


""I don't know what to do. I waited my whole life for H,"" I cry to Guy.


""I'm sorry about your friend. It sucks, people are harsh,"" he tries to comfort me.


I also wasn't sure if I wanted to be a fling to Guy or J. I'm tired of being someone's fling. I want to do things with someone I'm dating.

Signed,
Confused

tl;dr Told Guy I don't date/hook up with people at work because they can't keep it to themselves.  Guy tries to assure me he won't tell anyone.  I said maybe not now, we could see what happens later on.  I'm still not over H."
"Dear Reddit Diary,

It was great chilling with guys who didn't try to hook up with me. I was appreciative my new friend paid for my meal (it wasn't too expensive) and he didn't expect anything out of paying for me.

New Friend knows about my situation with my Childhood Friend. I said once I get my first paycheck I'll treat them out!


We're all in situations who could use a good friend and all that I need right now are good friends to talk to and hang out with my age. I told my new friends it was a relief to find friends my age to go to raves, etc. with.
Before, all I knew were old ladies 30 years older than me in their 60s in this new town and I was extremely depressed to keep meeting guys that would always try to hook up with me when I only want my childhood friend in that way.
I don't know what's going to happen with me and my childhood friend. I hope it's not the end because we had just met in person.
My new friend told me he has a sister who talked to this guy online for a long time...well they met in person and they aren't talking anymore. It was so sad. I just keep praying that isn't me.
My Childhood friend keeps telling me I make my own self-fulfilling prophecy but my prophecy has always been to marry my long time childhood friend and we have a happy married life.

Signed, 
Don't Know
tl;dr Hopefully after I get all my student loans, etc. paid first, I will have a better time hanging out with people more."
"Dear Reddit Diary,

He says he doesn't want to date me until I get myself established in our new town first.  Whenever I talk about this with people, they think it sounds ridiculous.  My guy shouldn't care what I have or don't have if he really likes me he would just be with me, or at least hang out with me or something!

Is he really waiting for me to be his ultimate dream girl turned reality when he could be talking to someone else?

By the time I am his real life dream girl, many other guys will want to talk to me, too!

I'm at a decent weight now, but I could be skinnier.  He used to be really fat, too, and when he told me I could lose a few pounds, I agreed. I didn't feel offended...I know I need to lose weight.  I mean since I've moved here I've gained 15 pounds!  Luckily it is proportionate, still I'd like to be maybe 115 pounds.  I'm 145 pounds and 5'3"" right now...may be a little chubby not fat or super fat, though.  I plan on being dropped off in the morning to work and then walking the hour and a half back home after work.  That's the only time I find walking and it's a straight shot down a long road.

People think I'm nuts walking that - I like walking and I don't mind, especially in this sunny neighborhood.  The only problem is when it rains and turns really cold.

I've seen his old pics and that's some motivation he really did used to be super fat and somehow he lost it all and he's trying to tell me to do the same...I'm not offended by his comment at all. If I had met him then, his weight wouldn't have mattered to me because I've been in love with him all these years, really glad he lost it, though.  I do really need to lose my weight, too.  He said it took him a long time to lose that fat he used to have.

To be honest, I don't think I would have dated him if he was still sharing a room with his dad, etc. the way I am sharing a room with my mom so I know what he means to become dating material...still..that doesn't mean we can't hang out as friends or f buddies or something.  This D drought, though! I told him over and over I don't hook up with random strangers I don't have feelings for. I can't do that. I need to hook up with someone I'm in love with...aka him.

He says, ""You shouldn't be focusing on getting some D anyways, you need to be working.""

He cracks me up.

Is he trying to be my muse like Erica Albright was Mark Zuckerberg's muse in The Social Network movie to get me to do something with myself?

I finally got a good start-up job so that's the first step done.  Now, the second step is to save up for a good car, and so on and so forth.

All I can do is do those things he said I need to do, and then see if he is indeed true to his word that he will date me once I complete those long-term goals...that could take at least a year...that's if he is willing to wait, too.

Signed,

Determined

tl;dr My friends tell me to take my time.  People nowadays are having kids when they are in their late 30s and early 40s. I'm only 29, ugh."
Being hospitalized is extremely scary. I hope I never have to go through that again.
"Dear Reddit Diary,

I did a silly unthinkable thing last night.  Although, I'm hired into a company now, I'm still looking for positions in my field.  I saw a CFO position was available within some larger, more established start-up companies.  I've been wanting to gain some experience in a lead role in a large organization, just was never given the opportunity.  I've only managed a small start-up.

What prompted me to do such a thing?  Well the previous boss I have has never been a boss in anything and she was promoted to the Production boss after just having been a regular worker and now she manages hundreds of employees from being one regular employee herself.  I'm not going to say whether or not she is a good boss, but let's just say I don't tolerate favoritism...although it was to my advantage to be one of their best workers.

I left because I moved to a different state.

My family friend said I had guts and was ballsy to be applying for CFO.  I had to word the Cover Letter as best as I could otherwise the HR Manager would think I'm nuts applying to such a position.  My family friend said I had a 5% chance...if that, and that's pushing it.

I feel like my guy wants me to be better than him before we become official and what better way to be better than him than to be CFO?  He could tell people he's banging the CFO!  Just kidding...I'm just kidding when I say that.  Gotta keep it professional and be private about stuff like that at work.  Besides, it's embarrassing telling people you're dating someone who is still sharing a room with yo mom while you save up to get a better place.  I want to be in a position where he wants to tell the world about me.  I'm reluctantly okay with this non-official title right now.

Signed,

Aim High.

tl;dr  What's the worse that could happen? HR says no, and I come back to reality and apply for a team member job rather than team lead.  Life goes on."
"Dear Reddit Diary,

What my friend has said about himself bothers me a whole lot.  It's been echoing in my brain after our phone conversation.

He says, ""I'm not a great guy.""  
You know it's bad when the guy admits himself that's he's not a great guy.  What did he do that makes him think that about himself?

My friend knows I think about him a lot way more than I should in this down time and so I analyze every little thing.

I won't reveal my friend's real name or anything, but when my friend told me the other day, ""I'm not a great guy,"" that just made me very sad he thinks he should be that way for whatever reason.  Who was the guy I was talking to all these years?  I never thought he wasn't a great guy before I met him in person.

I don't know what happened in his real life to make him think that he needed to act a certain way, but I can assure him I am not like those people who brought him down.  In fact, I want to do nothing but lift him up the way he is trying to do me sometimes.

I don't know what happened to him and other people, but I wish he would talk to me more about it so I can fully know what happened to my friend.

He is the greatest friend I have ever had and the most motivated friend and the best lover I have ever had.

Some girls are superficial and nitpick a guy [same as guys are to girls]...well that's not me.  I love everything about him except for him not letting me into his life.  I just wish he'd stop being so hard on himself and me and let me love him the way he wants someone to love him.  We don't need all those material/superficial things - just each other's company.

I dearly wish for him to ask me to hang out again soon so we can talk about this in person, too, and have a good sit-down and just talk about everything that has happened over the years...everything.  I hope to go to the gym with him because that would be a great way to hang out and fun time.

The innocent boy I knew from the Internet grew up to be a great man that I hope to get to know more and love more.

Signed,
Waiting"
"Dear Diary,

I will be starting a new job soon. Hopefully, that will keep me busy from thinking about kissing his lips and wondering when the next time I will be in his arms again. 

He is so close yet so far away: the person I want everything with who I have always wanted everything with. I was so happy to hear that he wants something real, too, but we are not in a position right now to be in a good relationship. We have survived lots of things, we can survive a little longer without it being official right now.

People say there is never a right time to be together to just be, but there is a right time. And when that time comes, there won't be as much trouble as there would be if we were to rush into something now.

I know what I have to do for us to happen and I hope it will.
Longing for his cuddles and sweet little kisses. I feel silly writing this about my long time Internet friend who I thought I would never get to meet and have met in person and other than our fights, it was wonderful when it was wonderful.

I just want to be with my love with no more troubles.
No more troubles.  We deserve a happy long life together after surviving some grueling years with other people that weren't right for us.

Signed, 
Hopeful"
"Dear Reddit Diary,

So I decided a while back that I'd try doing a biweekly diary entry here.  Is biweekly the right word?  I don't even know if I spealt that right.  Just thought it would be a nice new change of pace of all my normal stuff.  Anyways, I already write a lot in books but looking back, they're kind of hard to really find a specific memory I may be trying to remember something about or whatever.

So yea.  Here I am.  

Work was alright.  Started off a bit slow but it picked up the pace after a couple of hours.  It's my sister's birthday today.  We came up with the idea of sending each other bimonthly videos every two weeks before she left for uni.  I am just terrible at texting and keeping in contact with her and her birthday happened to land on my week so I am making her a video.  She's a bit pissed that she shares her day with our cat lol

I've started getting fit again.  This will be week 2.  My ass is killing me.  I only stopped for a week but the guilt!  And I had banana coconut cream pie.  My Mum made it.  I think the pie is making my exercise a bit counter productive but it was just too good to pass up!  Well to be fair, before I went on holiday last month I was exercising almost everyday for over a month so it's ok.  It's only pie.  And it was coconut!

Ok ok no more food talk.  I've got a meeting this Friday.  Not really looking forward to it but who does really.  I've got this old lamp that I really like but the lampshade's all broken and the lampstand (?) is still alright so I randomly had the idea of fixing it up.  I don't even know if it'll work but I'm willing to give it a shot.  I was thinking of making one of those projection lights lamps thingies that show up on the ceiling so I thought that would be cool to fall asleep to.

I feel like this is just a random diary post lol So yea, I am dedicating myself to doing this twice a week so I'll see you on Sunday, Reddit Diary.  

Goodnight."
"October 14, 2015
Dear Diary,

It’s been a while again. So much has happened in the last few days, it’s ridiculous. All things considered, I think I’m pretty level-headed. I’m in a pretty good mood today, which is the reason I am writing, I suppose. This evening, I’ll probably actually sit down to do some writing after I cook a bunch of food for the week. I just don’t want to deal with it the rest of the week.

My tutoring canceled on me tonight, and, to be honest, for that I am grateful. I really need the money right now, but I really could use some time to work on unfinished projects. Today has been productive. I have budgeted to get the school paid back in full, budgeted to pay for my friend to come here, and budgeted to come up with the money I’ll need, first thing next fall. For a while, I’m going to be eating a whole lot of cheap stuff…but that’s okay. I need to be responsible with my money and not go and blow it all on going out to eat and stuff. Occasionally, that’s fine, but not so much for every meal ever. I also looked at some estimates on how much I’m looking at spending on my trip this upcoming February.

I talked to Pretty Roommate Friend today. She and her boyfriend are on a break, which is, in the long run, going to be good for them. They have decided to take a break and to work on themselves, and then get couple’s therapy together. I think it’s great. I think Boyfriend and I could use couple’s therapy, but one step at a time. 

When I initially heard that PRF and her boyfriend broke up, I got really concerned because Boyfriend looks up to PRF’s Boyfriend like he can do no wrong…and I got worried it gave him the idea and the courage to break up with me. It was a stupid thought, but one I’ve considered quite a bit. I don’t want to go on a break with Boyfriend, not one bit. 

Our fight, as it turns out, was bigger than I initially had thought it was. He wanted to break up with me because I can be such a bitch sometimes. We decided that the next time we have to question our relationship, it will be the end. I’m not happy about it, but I suppose that is probably for the best. We’ve been together for nearly five years and he views the majority of it as a negative thing. I don’t want to keep him unhappy.

On the flipside, I think it’s given me the proper motivation to become a better person and conquer my dreams. I am officially enrolled with a therapist. It’s time to kick the anxiety and the low self-esteem. It’s time to take my life by the horns and forget the shitty stuff I’ve been through. It’s time to stop looking at that and start moving forward faster. I’ve overcome a lot, but I haven’t overcome enough. I need to stop being such a negative, passive-aggressive twat. It’s time to stop projecting how I feel about myself onto other people. I’m not proud of my actions, but, I need to realize that I am in control, that I am the only one who can really fix what’s wrong. Yes, I’m going to mess up along the way, but I need to strive harder to be a better person. I am not proud of who I am---which is something that needs to change. I need to be proud of myself and my accomplishments, not dwell in the self-loathing state I am in.

I am Stranded. I am Stranded in China and I can be better than I am now. I can be a better person. I can overcome any adversity I choose to. I can be a better person, and that’s exactly what I intend to do. 

The first thing in my plan is go to home and cook my food for the next few days---minus the veggies. I’ll cook those tomorrow at lunch. After that, I am going to finish sewing together my cosplay top for my Pokemon Trainer (I STILL HAVEN’T DONE THAT). When I finish that, I’ll feel at least a little accomplished, so I will totally have the motivation I need to continue working on my newest nosleep idea.

Tomorrow, at lunch, I will spend an hour studying Mandarin. I will also decide, for sure, which online university I will attend. I’m debating a degree in Liberal Arts (to keep my attention), or English---maybe I can eventually be an ESL teacher back home in America. 

Friday, I will be going to Shaibu to buy some fabric for my Louise cosplay. I’m pretty excited and thrilled and just ecstatic about it. Next Thursday, my company will come to watch my class. I’m not nervous at all. My classes are very well managed and I think, if anything, it’s going to help my standing within my company. I don’t plan on being with this company forever, but probably for another two or three years…so I can’t slack.

I confessed to BBF that I care for him as a brother, and that helped my lust for him go away quite a bit. We talked about how we aren’t close with our families and how we both aspire to be someone great. That was really helpful too---because I adore the fact that Boyfriend is close with his family---and I’m really close with mine too. I think the weird feelings that were bubbling up are going to go away now. 

I just finished watching an anime and it was incredible and deep. I am looking forward to watching another and watching the live action with BFF. I am still feeling a little butt-hurt, because Boyfriend gives her so much attention, but after my fight with him, I can’t afford to have any negative feelings about close friends or about him for a really long time. I am walking on eggshells. I need to get better. I am going to get better.

This is the longest entry yet! I don’t have much else to say. I’d really like to go get to work on my story now---which gives me an extra half an hour to enjoy writing. Ahhh. Time for some me time; time to relax. 

Peace, Love, Pancakes.

"Dear Diary, 

This is going to be a short entry. 

I'm at KTV. I feel so empty and like I'm going crazy. I'm being consumed by my thoughts. I can't stop imagining them together. It's driving me to absolute madness. 

I don't know how much longer I can keep my mask up. I'm not that strong.

"October 9th, 2015
Dear Diary,

It’s been a while since we last met. More than a week, I think. While I was in Singapore, I lost the drive to write in you every day and now, I’ve come to realize just how valuable writing in you really is. It’s definitely helping me keep my thoughts in check. I can’t let myself become too busy to write in you again. This has to be an every day thing or else, I’m going to become a victim of my vicious thoughts again---which means more fighting, which means the chances of getting what I want grow slimmer. I can’t lose control again. Not this year. Hopefully, not ever.

Singapore itself was very nice, but Boyfriend seemed more distant than usual. He was probably waiting for a fight that we never had. Singapore was interesting to see. I loved the architecture and the layout of the city. The public transportation was also very convenient and easy to follow. I might want to move there. I haven’t decided what’s next yet. I need to do that soon because I’m going nuts with not knowing what’s next. My future seems so insecure at the moment. 

I decided that I will be going back to school as soon as possible. I know that in order to get to the next place, I need to graduate with a bachelor’s degree. I’ve had a taste of what it’s like to not be a waitress, so I am determined to never step foot in a restaurant as an employee ever, ever, ever again. I’m a little lost as to which degree I want to pursue though. I can’t find an online linguistics degree---the closest thing is definitely a Liberal Arts degree---because then I can study everything that I have a passion for. The only problem is---who hires someone with a liberal arts degree? I know I don’t want to be a teacher in the US, unless, maybe, I get to be an ESL teacher. Which is what I do now. But yeah. The other thing I am considering is going for a degree in Business Administration---but I literally have zero passion for it. I just know my family would never go hungry and would have the things that they need. But I don’t know if I really want to go for that. I might get depressed with school or lose drive or something. But I gotta figure out what the hell I can do with a liberal arts degree. 

Boyfriend has been hanging out with BFF a lot. I’ve been feeling a little neglected because of it. He’s spent way too much time with her. The first thing he did when we got back was go hang out with her while I had to stay home in bed because I was being sick. He ignored his phone and stayed out really late. I went to bed. They had lunch together yesterday. They worked out and had dinner together today and he neglected to bring home the medicine I needed for more than two hours because he was so busy with her. I feel jealous. Unreasonably jealous, because I know that they really are just friends----in fact, they’re like siblings. And I know that because I see how they interact when they are together. There is no sexual attraction between them. But I keep having the thoughts that he cares for her more than me. I need the thoughts to go away. I’m hoping putting this out there will help ease the thoughts. 

Even though I should have a lot to say, I don’t. My brain is turning off. My head hurts. I’m going to watch TV for a bit. Then I’m going to go to bed. I am so depressed, it’s ridiculous. 

Signing off.

"October 2nd, 2015

Dear Diary,

I completely spaced writing yesterday. Yesterday was super awesome and incredibly busy. I started my day off right by sleeping in until 11:30am and then proceeding to Oviraptor Toast and nomming down some chocolate banana French toast. It was delicious. After that, I said my goodbyes to Boyfriend and headed down to Convention and Exhibition Center for our anime convention.

The convention was really nice! It was actually supposed to be a video game convention, but there weren’t many people dressed up as video game characters. It was a whole lot of Lolita and random anime characters---and then this super awesome Marvel display. I mean, there were other things too like a live DJ and some professional cosplayers here in China---but again, it really wasn’t much of a game convention.

I never had the opportunity to finish my pokemon trainer cosplay. But, even though I couldn’t finish, I am happy to say that I at least had a crap ton of fun. There were a lot of people that asked me to take a picture with them, solely based on the fact that I’m white. It was kind of cool and gave me the motivation I needed to begin sewing again. I just kind of thought, “If people swarm me when I’m wearing dumb cat ears, how are they going to react when I have a costume? And when I have a recognizable  costume?” 

So I almost finished sewing the base of my trainer cosplay. It fits a bit tightly, so I may need to wear my corset with it until I can drop another 10-15lbs. I also started looking into more serious investments. I looked into an embroidery machine and a serger. I need both, unfortunately, for two of my upcoming costumes. I’m hoping Best Friend will go in on them with me because she wants to go into cosplay too. I figure I can make all my bases and wait on the other stuff. But we’ll see. 

My upcoming costumes over the next several months (in no particular order) are: Pokemon Trainer Female (Omega Ruby); Yuna (FFX); Princess Serenity (Sailor Moon); Sakura (Cardcaptor Sakura); Neo Queen Serenity (Sailor Moon); Sailor Moon (manga version); Louise (Bob’s Burgers); Yuno Gasai (Future Diary); Haruhi (The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya); female!L (Death Note); female!Sora (Kingdom Hearts); and Charmander (Pokemon gajinka). I had other requests from friends back home---Kaylee from Firefly, Jinx from LoL, Tiny Tina from Borderlands, Poison Ivy from Batman and a few others. But we’ll see. I mean, I do plan on doing most of them, but I want to focus on quality, rather than quantity. 

I am hoping my Princess Serenity or Neo Queen Serenity costume will look nice enough for a competition. I’m going to be looking into how to mould things with epoxy resin and different techniques for making weapons. I might compete using Yuna, simply because her weapon is so badass. But who knows? I haven’t decided. I just know that I’ll be competing in my first competition at Anime Expo. I’m shooting for my first photo shoot in November or December. Goals. So. Many. Goals. Being around a bunch of nerds in costume is always ridiculously inspiring. 

I’m currently sitting in the Hong Kong airport. I am pretty bummed because Boyfriend and I missed our flight this morning, due to excessive waiting at the border. So we had to pay out $350 to buy our tickets to get to Singapore. Gonna miss my safari. I was really looking forward to it. Oh well. I suppose that there are worse people to be stuck with than Boyfriend.

BBF went to Japan. I’m really grateful for that. The space away from him has cleared my head. My crush doesn’t feel so intense now, which is a huge, huge, huge relief. It’s barely even in the back of my mind. I am just so grateful to be with Boyfriend right now because we don’t ever get time together. Even though we’re just sitting at McDonald’s without even looking at each other, it’s comforting just being in his presence. I feel fairly calm, my morning considered. I am happy knowing that I’m getting the next few days with him, just us. I am so excited for this time together. It’s times like these that I realize how truly blessed I am.

Alright, I’m going to study or write or something. I am just tired. Need to get my creative juices flowing so that I can wake up. Me and three hours of sleep don’t get along too well. Gotta do something to stimulate my happy chemicals or else I’m going to get depressed. Ain’t nobody wanna be around that shit. 

Signing Off,
Stranded"
"I heard a bunch of songs while running to grab some fast food during my lunch break. A lot of them. But most seemed to be the sad sort.

I guess it's my mood, I guess it's where I'm left at this point.

As I drank honey mustard and stuffed fried chicken bits into my mouth while driving, I let the music play and followed it on the journey it took me on. My mind is a vast place but I can fill it with memories, moments that I can see details in.

[One song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnfSoaJxe3Y) came on and I'm surprised it hadn't played before.

I stopped to grab smokes, always smoking always running out. I put on my games face, I made some people laugh got my smokes and got out. In the car another [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuZA6qiJVfU) played as I drove home.

I posted here because I've been writing to myself, not to anyone in particular. Or at least not anymore.

But songs. Songs have an innate ability to connect. People wonder why birds sing. Love is for the birds, isn't it? I saw her tee-shirt as I wrote that. I wonder how I got this far some times.

I smile at the memories more than frown, they were good. But it's a weak smile, tenuous pulls at the corners of my lips. I remember how strong the urge used to be.

It's odd because I see myself as rather serene on the surface. Like an inverted austerity. Instead of calmly angry, I'm just peacefully content.

It's hot today, the squirrels just lie flat-out on the branches in submission to the beating sun. Fall breezes coolly stroke the sweat on my skin as I sit on the shade of the porch smoking and writing this.

My mind is, as it always is, distant. Not my typically fly-brained distractions, I'm truly aloof.

I went to that BBQ place we always talked about going to. It was sub-par. Bland mac n cheese, over slated collard greens, poor service, and their sauce was like honey mustard with vinegar. I ate it none the less and sat at the table staring at baseball listlessly. I had no memories of us here aside for the fact that we talked about going there. It was almost still in my mind.

I still think of her too much. But it's a lovely sort of feeling, better than happiness, it's sublime. I hear them on the radio a lot, too."

Dear Diary,

Today started out like most days. I got up, I hit snooze, I got up, I hit snooze, and I finally managed to roll out of bed. I threw on my clothes and brushed my teeth, and then walked to the school where I teach. I thought today was going to be like any other day, you know? It was going to be boring and monotonous and OH MY GOD I JUST WANT TO GET THROUGH THIS WEEK SO I CAN HURRY UP AND BE IN SINGAPORE! 

But I was wrong. 

I got on reddit today and looked under confessions and found something that bothered me. Someone decided that they were hurting so badly that they wanted to kill themselves. They tried to and failed. It made me feel really sad and made me think back to the time where I would’ve done it, had my friend not walked in the room. 

I remember that evening. It was during college and after my ex and I broke up. Don’t get me wrong, he was a scumbag, but, at the time, I couldn’t see that. At the time, I thought that it was the end of the world because he had moved on and I hadn’t. I thought there was no reason left to live. I walked into the kitchen after crying. I felt so completely worthless and like I had no future. I took my friend’s Shun out of the block and, as I began to lower the knife to my stomach to gut myself, my best friend walked into the kitchen and grabbed the knife from my hand and called me an idiot. I crumbled up onto the floor and cried in her arms. She called my mom and my mom freaked the frick out. She finally believed me that I needed help. It took going that far to need help. But, thanks to my mom and thanks to my counselor and thanks to my doctor, I managed to get my head above water for a while. Had my friend not walked into the kitchen right at that time, she would’ve walked into the kitchen to find me eviscerated and she would’ve been scarred for life. Thinking back on it, I’m really happy I didn’t leave that mess for someone else to clean up.

From time to time, I still go through serious bouts of depression. Sometimes, I want to throw myself off of buildings and other times, I want to jump into traffic. But I’m too much of a coward to. I am afraid of death, just like most anyone else. I am scared to know what happens after I die. I am afraid of the state I’d leave my loved ones in. In my opinion, I feel that, while suicide is a very selfish act (but, on the flipside, it’s selfish for people to ask you to keep living when you don’t see your self-worth), I also feel like it’s brave. For me, I’m lucky that, for the most part, I came out of it. I don’t have those constant thoughts that I used to have. I have surrounded myself with supportive people and got myself into a new and exciting environment. I basically got to start over. I mean, I am on medication too---don’t get me wrong. And I am still going through therapy. That’s what part of me keeping this diary is about, actually. But, slowly but surely, I am starting to find a reason to live, a reason to keep myself happy. 

Can I tell you whether living your life is worth it or not? No. I am not one to judge. That’s your call. I had the strength to overcome the hardest part. I can’t tell you that I get stronger everyday, because I don’t. On some days, I feel horrible. Sometimes, to be honest, it’s a real challenge to get up in the morning. But I do it. Why? Not because I have anything to prove to anyone. Not because I am brave and not because of the people around me. I get up and I live my life everyday because once it’s over, it’s over. I know that the struggles I’ve been through have been awful, but I also know that something great could happen if I just keep going. I hold on to this small sliver of hope that things will get better. And, luckily for me, they have. I now live in China and I get to travel. I get to work with children. I get to make goals and I get to laugh. I surround myself with the best people I can.

If you’re going through this and contemplating ending it, before you do, take a leap of faith and move and start over. Surround yourself with people who are supportive and happy. Why? Because life can get better. And because you probably make someone’s life better. If you’re feeling alone, send me a PM. I’m happy to talk to you. I’ve been there. I struggle with it too. I can relate. I can empathize. 

I’m on my way to the hospital to pick up my sleeping, depression, and anxiety medication now, so I need to get going. Tonight I have to tutor some children and continue working on my cosplay. Wish me luck!

Dear Diary,

Today has been actually really nice. I’m maintaining my mood better and better. This is the most stable I’ve felt in a few weeks. I haven’t had all sorts of crazy emotions. I’ve even felt happy! Today was a very happy day for me, actually. I only felt low at one point, so I suppose there’s hope for me beating depression after all. 

During my low point, I was concerned that Boyfriend didn’t feel satisfied with sex today because he didn’t really talk to me during like he normally does and he stopped much earlier than normal. At first, I decided that it was something I did wrong and I was convinced he was still mad at me. But then, I said something to him and he frowned and I knew that I had been wrong. We didn’t fight over it though, which was nice. It turns out that he was just really pressed for time today.  HUGE relief.

Something that’s been kind of bothering me is the fact that I have been questioning my faith. I am not even sure I am Christian anymore. It won’t be a problem with the majority of my family if I decide that I don’t believe in the Bible. And, when I’ve talked to Boyfriend about it, he’s seemed cool with it. But, I know that if I ever decide to leave our church, his mom is gonna have a shit fit and we’ll both be disowned. He could get kicked out of church for dating a non-believer. Hell, he could probably get kicked out of our church for me not having faith that our church is the one true church. I don’t know. 

I’m pretty sure that Jesus existed and I’m positive that He was a pretty stand-up guy. I’m positive that there is a God, too. I don’t know if I believe everything the Bible says though. Actually, I just don’t believe everything the Bible says. I barely believe any of it at all, anymore. My beliefs are kind of out there at this point. Like, I believe in God. I have NO doubt that He exists. But, I also believe in science. And, with some of the strange experiences I have had (SO MUCH DEJAVU), I kind of am beginning to think that I’m stuck in this timeline and I have to relive my life over and over again until I get it right. Or maybe there are parallel universes and my experiences that were dreams were actually memories of another me…? I don’t know anymore. 

Either way, I am pretty sure that my church makes me feel unhappy. I’ll keep attending to keep the peace in the family, but I don’t think I believe half the crap my church says. I’m pretty sure that most of it is bullshit. I’ve listened to the same lessons over and over and, upon close examination, I’m pretty certain that half the stuff they preach is just a way to control the members of the church, and not necessarily in a good way. The church sometimes makes me feel uncomfortable, when they talk about how we should always submit to the church administration and how the church administration is like a new version of the apostles. This all started when they were like, “We get to choose who goes to Heaven and who doesn’t because God gave us that power.” They’re just so judgmental. I hope that, by the time Boyfriend and I are married with children, he wants to find a new church to go to. But that’s doubtful. Like I said, World War III will break out with his mother and he was born and raised inside this church.

The thing about my church that I do like is the consistency in which they preach. They don’t ever back down and stand by their beliefs. I like that it’s strict too---we don’t have a ton of hypocrites that attend because those who screw up have to repent hardcore to get their memberships back. Overall, the people in my church are good people. The administration just kind of sucks...

I have to get to work on a cosplay. This Thursday, I am going to go to an anime convention. It’s pretty awesome. I’m pretty excited. I have a lot to get done before I can go though, so I’m not going to type up an entry that’s a million pages long today. I gotta go get the damned shirts cut out. I’m going to be the trainer from Pokemon Omega Ruby. I’m pretty excited! It’s the first costume I’m making in a long time. Hopefully, when I get back from Singapore, I can buy a wig and get started on my Louise costume (Bob’s Burgers). I want to do a photo shoot and start putting myself out there here in a few months, after I finish losing weight. Only like, ten pounds to go! JIAYOU! 

Anyway, got a lot to do and I gotta be up early tomorrow. I’m gonna go get those shirts cut out and hit the hay. Tomorrow is gonna be a long, long, long, long, long day. 

Signing off.

Dear Diary,

Today wasn’t terrible. Today, my mood was actually a whole lot higher than it has been lately. I’ve been looking forward to spending time with Boyfriend all day long and I think that might’ve been the thing that put my brain into happy-chemical-making-mode. 

I didn’t think that today was going to be very good when I watched my bus pull away before I was at the bus stop. I should’ve just hopped on the metro, but I didn’t. Instead, I waited and waited for the next bus, because the sign says that the bus should come every ten minutes. Usually, that’s the case, but I forgot that today was a holiday. 

Anyway, I went to Vicky’s house and, due to bus issues, I was pretty late. Her behavior was better than normal, so I couldn’t complain. I welcomed the coffee that her mother offered to me with open arms. I didn’t think about the fact that coffee is, indeed, a mild laxative. 

So an hour later, on my way back to the metro, the urge to go to the bathroom hit me like a senior linebacker plowing into a freshman. I booked it to the metro and ran into the bathroom. Luckily, there was no line. I squatted down over the toilet and did my business. I reached into my purse to pull out tissues and became panicked. My tissues were missing and I realized that I only had three options.  

Option One: I could use my hand. The old ladies that were queuing up outside the stall would see it all over my hand and probably die of laughter from the sight of a foreigner with crap smeared all over their hand. Plus, I’d be putting fecal matter into the hand washing sink---and even though I did happen to have soap in my purse, it wasn’t anti-bacterial soap. 

Option Two: It wasn’t exactly the cleanest of craps I’ve taken, but I seriously considered just leaving it. Sure, I’d walk around and smell worse than a baby’s diaper, but hey! At least when I got to my next job, I could clean up there. They’d understand that their private tutor came over to their house smelling worse than a buffalo, right? 

Option Three: I could tear up the tutoring material I had prepared for the next family and not commit social suicide. I’d just have to completely wing my lesson and buy a new book for the student. I was already late, so why not show up unprepared too? 

I’m pretty sure that my butt has tiny paper cuts. Sitting is pretty uncomfortable. At least tutoring didn’t go horribly wrong or anything. It was kind of fun winging it. And since the little girl was extremely well-behaved today, it mostly worked out. I didn’t go to work with a distracting odor about me and I didn’t shock any sweet old ladies to death.

After that escapade, nothing too special happened. I had a difficult time flagging down a taxi, as per the norm. I tutored one last student, Lucy, and then took her out to dinner since she’s been working so hard. We walked down to KFC, which is right below her apartment and she taught me how to say some new things in Chinese. After we finished most of our meals, I went and got her some ice cream because her parents don’t ever give her treats. When I sat back down and handed her the ice cream cone, I leaned over the table and told her that she should dip one of her fries into her ice cream. The look on her face was priceless; she must’ve thought I escaped from the mental ward or something. I was really proud when she tried it anyway and, as she smiled, I felt like my mission on earth was complete. She informed me, “Teacher, this is very good. Maybe my friends can have a try. I will always eat my fries like this.” 

I doubt her mother is going to be too happy with me.

The party last night went much better than I had originally anticipated it would. I went home from my photo shoot (which was killer fun, by the way) yesterday and got ready to go. Grabbed the Filipino spaghetti out of the frig and embarked on my journey toward Daxin, with my partner in crime next to me. She was trying really hard to cheer me up because I was letting out some pretty heavy sighs. Then, I got a stupid text from my boyfriend. He was still mad at me from our fight the other night and made it clear that he would be civil, but also that he was not going to pay any special attention to me. I was super bummed and almost told my friend that I was going to go home. Luckily enough, I didn’t. 

When we got off the train, we started talking about gender-bending some Death Note cosplays and then we broke out into song. And, if that hadn’t put me into a good mood, our batman voices certainly did. We went into 7-Eleven and grabbed the last few things we needed for the party. The look on the cashier’s face was amazing when I thanked her in my best batman voice. 

The night only got better from there. I didn’t get trashed, but most everyone else did. After everyone got there, we celebrated with the Pokemon Drinking Game and took birthday shots with the three birthday people. I somehow managed to control my drinking intake so that I wasn’t completely out of line. I am pretty proud of my behavior, overall. Well, I mean, minus kissing the sad friend to get her to stop crying. That was a little weird to wake up thinking about. According to the schedule I keep in my phone, I have plans to take a Muay Thai class in two weeks and plans to cuddle with the friend I kissed after school on Monday. I wonder if I asked my boyfriend permission before I made any of these outlandish plans. 

Anyway, it’s time for second dinner now. Boyfriend is starving and we’re apparently on good terms again, so I’m going to seize the opportunity and take a shot at getting laid tonight.

"Dear Diary,
Today is a good day. Mostly because this will probably be one of the last days that I can sleep in and be as lazy as I want. I have been searching for a full time job after quitting job after job. When you feel like you can't keep a job its not the best feeling. I posted to a few new subreddits, and I can't wait to get to know some more people. I go to an event every friday, so I can't wait for that. I wish that money grew on trees, ya know? Or that it was easier to get. I am lucky to have the family support I have, but I look forward to being independent enough to not have to lean on someone else for rent and other things I need. 
Thanks for listening, and I'll post again soon. "

Big news

Big motherfucking news

We all know Gary is fucking weird, ~~like I didn’t saw that coming.~~

Apparently around the time he became a mombie (i.e Zombie and crazy for babies), he also became a power ranger (i.e. joined the first aids club in the school) and I also found out he’s a fucking ~~scientologist~~ Christian ~~and the brainwashed type.~~

I fucking knew it!

Let’s just say I creeped out and saw an old photo of “the children of the church” (i. e He’s a children too?) going to visit some paganist shit.

Godammit is there anyone in this town who isn’t a scientologist?!!! Cece is also a scientologist

So basically he ~~willingly~~ spents extra hours in the school ‘cause he’s a power ranger now, evenings teaching kids that I quote: “We’re the bests at this school in protecting ourselves” ~~What~~

He also went to my class (and apparently he doesn’t need to wear the power ranger suit, ~~why he doesn’t wear that silly suit? motherfucker~~ ) as he went to my classroom to talk about safety I naturally didn’t pay any attention to him and kept my vision limited to my notebook, I suspect he was expecting some reaction from me but nothing happened cos I didn’t even look at him.

In “the timeskip” (aka: When I stopped being classmates with him but still went to the same school) when I met his former friends he became friends with Jo (a girl with whom I was close in my junior year, who stopped being friends with me because I didn’t let her copy my whole French test, then again, who has?, and changed me for someone who in the future would flunk her year and for that Jo was left alone anyway)

He also went to my classroom (as a civil, with another guy) but I almost didn’t notice his evil existence, I was focused in fixing my pen. He seemed disappointed. Or something.

And now he just doesn’t seem to have any friends, the evil minions he had, flunked their year, one of them is with his fiancé, Jo doesn’t seem to know him anymore. Cece never paid any attention to him anyway. And I pay less attention to him because I barely go out on recess anyway.
Gary has just become vulgar entertainment to me.

Here’s the grand ultimate supreme thing: recently (May lol!) I decided to take a photo with a girl (I never do!) and I thought fuck it, no one is going to see it, because I’m basically anonymous, yes, even through this girl is friends with Gary, he can’t be stalker enough, may not be in facebook that day to see it and it will disappear from his feed, what could go wrong?

It went wrong.

The first and the only photo of this honorable yeti, was liked by Gary  himself in facebook.

I kid you not.

I KID YOU NOT!!!

WHAT THE EVER LOVING GODIVA?!

I could feel the blood rush in my face, my heart was beating fast and I could have choked on something at the time.

What the ever loving fuck

Gary you’re insane.

Literally

Now, the little times I have seen that pycho he was wearing a muffler…a navy blue one. Things like “Ohh she took it off” when pestering me in fifth grade and now he wears one???!!

Oh, god.

OH, GOD NO

NO

NO!

The good news is that I have seen him go home with one girl, good ~~before he used to go with a crowd of clones, so he’s lost territory~~. Once, with a girl holding an umbrella for him ~~what~~ and he said loudly when I was passing by: “How shameless” might or not be related to moi.

The bad news are that he switches girls, once I saw a blond one.

So no, he might not have a girlfriend ~~and he’s so pOpUlAr~~

And another lesser prize: in facebook he publishes things in French.
Like “RU MINE?” let’s take in account that he’s the worst at pronuntiation, is a poser and using google translate

…or he’s trying to learn.

Choker, posts in French?

NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE

**NOPE**

~~Hey I had never used caps like these before, it’s fun~~

Oh and another post had a quote from Eleanor & Park book that I did read ~~but he did not. I’m so fucking sure of it. Poser~~

“She never looked nice. She looked like art, and art wasn't supposed to look nice; it was supposed to make you feel something.”

And there was a picture with that post. I’m using an image blocker (to train visualization and I’m good at it!!) so I have to click on a special spot to see the image.

And you couldn’t guess how long I was laughing that it was a photo of him wearing a cowboy hat ~~I was expecting a mombie post, apparently he’s “Art”~~

TL;DR: Blocked Gary on facebook and facebook apologized for it. Lol’d. will be unblocking him in…2020?

Also, why do I post every seven days??!

"It is always good to interact on a personal level every now and then. So, go ahead. Fire away!"
"Just wanted to give y'all a heads up that we will be doing weekly themes for Fictional posts in the future. Not this month, we still only have a small number of subscribers. "
"So, since I last wrote in here, the real estate company I was with is now fired due to insulting my friend who is family to me, as in truth some friends can be closer than family.  It was the straw that broke that camels back. They were giving me hundreds of reasons why my home could not sell rather than the ones about how it could.  I had no faith in them now no matter if the other contract fell through or not.  I went to them originally due to my friendship with the agent and that has not changed.  In time I found out their main business is auctioning homes and my home is not an auction home needing a ton of fix up. 

The new agent is more local and knows this market better and is in an agent and a broker with ties to the county for ease of the transaction.  He estimates a 3 week period and a sale with me walking away with my goal amount. 

That goal is mostly spent to pay off debt but with a small amount left to move on to a MUCH smaller home, but I am very okay with that.  This was my moms home and she is dead now.  She wanted me to sell off everything and move on.  I am finally able to do it. 

It sucks to lose someone you love and love my mom I did.  She told me once that she will not always like me, but as my mother she will always love me and it was true.  The feeling was mutual. So, yes, I am in the last stage of grief, that of acceptance.  "
"I've never really had to face my own mortality before. Not until a few weeks ago. Up until then, death was more of an abstract concept to me. Something distant that I knew was inevitable and just another part of life. I haven't believed in a God or any sort of afterlife since I was a young child, so I see death as absolute and believe that our time here is all we really have. I was not afraid of death at all, I would rather die someday than live forever because not existing after a long life seems nice. However, this ordeal made me realize that I was extremely terrified of dying too soon.

It started with an extreme migraine that would not go away. It was so bad that I had to take off work and lay in a dark room all day just to keep from throwing up. I did not sleep for two days straight because of the pain and was unable to drive. I started puking every couple of hours even though I was completely unable to eat. On the third morning, I realized that my heart was pounding violently in my chest harder than it ever had before. I crawled to my couch and dialed 911. I wasn't really aware of what was going on at that point, my brain felt so fried. As I was talking to the operator, I realized that I could barely get enough air to speak. I managed to get my address out and walk to the ambulance when it arrived.

I had no idea what was going on with me. I really doubted it was a heart attack because I am not overweight and am a runner and weightlifter, but it felt like it might be that. I got an oxygen mask that helped a little bit and then off to the hospital we went.

When they wheeled me into the ER, things had gotten noticeably worse. I barely remember this time. Even the oxygen mask was not enough and I was gasping for air. They ran an EKG and it came back normal. They ran some blood tests, and discovered that my blood was incredibly acidic. So acidic that anyone who manages to survive that comes back with brain damage and all kinds of organ failure. By some miracle I got through this with no permanent damage, but I really should be dead. The doctor was talking about doing a case study to figure out how I lived through that shit unscathed.

Well it turns out that this was caused by me having uncontrolled diabetes for several years. I don't understand how I got it but it happens I guess. They pumped me with enough insulin and bicarb to kill a horse and after 7 days in the ICU and $30,000 in medical bills later, I was sent home with a glucose meter, insulin, a shitload of pills, and every ounce of life drained out of me. I was awake for 96 hours because I couldn't sleep until my third day in the hospital. I was in a haze for a good week or two. The whole thing really fucked with me.
It still fucks with me. Now I think of all the missed opportunities my death would have caused. It would have fucked up my fiance really really bad. We never would have been able to get married, have kids, and grow old together. I finally got to the good part of my life, establishing a great career in my field and having just graduated college.

It really bothers me how close I came to dying alone on the floor of my apartment for no reason at all. If I had waited another 5 minutes to call 911, I would be dead. Life moves on and I've buried myself in work, diet, and exercise, but this has really fucked me up emotionally.

"Ask me my name and I will tell my story.

How my expectations in my life

were torn to pieces and how I regret

telling you what you never asked.

I don't lie because I know when I do.

I am afraid about my judgement towards myself.

But I vent. Oh I vent. Please look at me,

please tell me I am a fine being and

I am precious, special and extraordinary.

That is how I know, the only way

to show you who I am, what I am.

And I complain about them,

whoever doesn't vent. And,

I say I am honest. 

While it is just a way 

to find some pity

for me, my miserable self.

What do I have to offer

a silence before I speak

before I share my story

because I am special

can't you see by now."
"I got the day off today, but tomorrow I'll be returning to work. Nothing much else to say about that. Just gonna do more science stuff and then go home! Unfortunately, I do have the Saturday shift, but it's no big deal. As I've stated before, it gives me an excuse to get outside.

What else can I talk about this entry? What else? What else?

Well, I guess I can talk about other things. You know, my brother was asking me about when am I ever getting into a committed relationship with someone. Hah! I think he means when am I getting married to the ""woman of my dreams"". Pfft! There's no such thing as fantasy stuff like that. I don't believe in that, and I don't believe in meeting someone of your dreams ""magically"". 

Maybe I have a stick up my ass, but it doesn't seem to be plausible for something like that to happen. Besides, I enjoy my own company. For now. I mean, I have thought about being in a relationship with someone. There are times, admittedly, where I'll be sitting alone in a restaurant and looking across the table at the lonely chair staring back at me. I enjoy my own company, but it can get very lonely.

Still, I've always felt that if you can't take care of yourself first, then you can't take care of others. That's always been my philosophy. Well, no, that's bullshit. I used to try to help as much as I could to other people, but I learned the hard way that those who ask will almost always never tell you to stop. If you keep giving, they'll keep taking. It's a cynical point of view, I'll admit, but it's something I've regarded back to whenever I think about helping someone I believe is worthwhile.

Huff! Maybe I should just be single forever. It's not necessarily a bad thing, I think, as long as you're happy. Rather, as long as you're content. Maybe ""happy"" is a little too much.

I do sound like a miserable S.O.B. to others, I'm sure, but this is how I am. I've always been a solitary person, though I do enjoy other people's company. I don't hate people, but I tend to enjoy people in small dosages, if you get what I'm saying. I'm not an introvert, but I guess some would label me as such. I hate labels like that.

I do sometimes wish I had a true, committed friend to have around. My brother is the closest person I've got, but he's got his own life, as I do mine. Maybe when this pandemic is all over, I'll find someone."
"I am completely twacked out. This is some of the best candy I've had in a hot minute! I can barely write in this journal, so I went digital. My hands are shaking as if I have Parkinson's.
Today I was supposed to work with my friend steve. yesterday I took off because I was completely sore from the extreme working we did Monday through Wednesday. He said that's fine, there's nothing wrong with that. I could take off Thursday and work on Friday. When I woke up this morning I text Steve at 5 to 8:00 a.m., and tell him to let me know when he's on the way. 4 hours, 20 text messages, and five phone calls later, he finally text me back explaining why he hasn't answered me all morning.
Since I've known him, he has always come through on whatever it is I asked him to do. Though I have noticed that he is an airhead, and he forgets about a ton of stuff that he says he's going to do. Which is extremely annoying!
That being said I have had the apartment to myself all day so far. I found a way to come up with some money, and it just so happened that one of my dealers was able to drive down from West palm, and meet me. I'm surprised he did come through, because I have ghosted him in the past. I make it about two blocks back toward home, when I open up the receipt he gave me, and realize that I dropped one of the Caps that he gave me. With it looking like gravel essentially, I just kept walking. I found a little spot behind Staples to talk down, out of the wind, and rip a huge Rock for the first time today. Blast off!
As I was saying before, this truly is some of the best crack I've had. My state of mind this morning is completely different than my state of mind at this moment. This morning I was playing around with the idea of not being here anymore. Now please let it be known that this is something I WILL NEVER DO! it is only a thought that passes through my mind from time to time. I'm guessing you, yourself, have played with the idea once before. I got so far as to write a few letters to leave behind, as a way of letting go of my emotional pain, as well as anything that lingers in my thoughts and causes issues for me.
But as I sit here now on the couch, with South Park on the TV, my vape in hand, and my medication close by, I feel as if I'm glued presently to this reality. It's when the drugs run out that I become overly anxious, depressed, with a racing mind, wondering how I'm going to get my next fix, and how am I going to get off of this hellish merry-go-round.
Self-destructive is one of my top personality traits, in addiction. It's not that I don't value my life, it's more than I'm not afraid of death. I always find myself wondering what happens after our soul leaves this body. Do we even have any kind of existence after our body dies? Do we have the ability to reconnect with past loved ones that have died before us? Are we able to come back and forth between this realm and the afterlife? These are questions I find myself thinking about a lot lately.
 I know there is a higher power than me in this universe. I don't know who or what that higher power is, or when that higher out of power existed. Maybe it created the universe, lived out its life, and then passed on itself? Or maybe once this body dies our soul upgrades to something else. Maybe the human form, once outside of its mother's womb becomes a vessel for the souls gestation. I guess anything is possible.
This week I have been helping my sponsor, Steve remodel an apartment. Monday through Wednesday I was lifting old tile and disposing of it. I also took off all of the trim around the walls, the light switches and outlets, among many other small tasks.

This morning I asked him to call me on his way to pick me up. 9:00a.m. came and went. 10:00 a.m. around 11:00 he finally text me back, telling me he was busy this morning with the kids, and that he would cash at me my paycheck in a little bit. I completely understand that people are busy, and have other things to attend to, but the first message at 7:30 a.m., showed that he view the text message... So why not take you two seconds to message me back?"
"Gf, I spoke about my native American gf. The western world and how it has degraded my mind. Forcing me to rely on others, others who at heart where afforded privileges I wasnt. But we both know I have withstood that mental turmoil


Anyway I wanted you to know there is a possibility of a native American I met at a really early point. We may have already married even. I know the way this post will be interpreted and that we are all being manipulated. Me to insane levels, but there you have it my thoughts being I would probably see this native American as a quick easy grab. Appreciating there rarity and their history aligning with mine.


I thought about the possibility of me and mine making the serious agreements of our relationship & love. This is possibility related to my terrible love life here. This isn't great time to make these posts being our distance being felt. But it was a taste of something new, and a goodly thought that needed to be shared.

So get back to me on spa session, massage session all that we love. I realise these post create disconnect they always seem to. But you are not the only one capable of test. I need to know your loyalty is pure. And that is the only way anyway, let us stop the trigger stuff for awhile. It may be bread butter of our emotional relationship. But it is not good precedent, it will became borne in your blood manipulative ugly ways. Anyway we both miss each other, put it where matters baby"
"2/21/2021

I guess it starts here.  A friend of mine suggested that I start writing down my feelings in a  journal. Just to get them out in a constructive way. I haven't done this in a long time but the beginning of 2021 has been rough, on a lot of people. So maybe it will be good for me. 

It all started back on new years eve. My buddy B and I decided that this year we weren't going to be so socially isolated. We spent years being friends with the same group of people and honestly our friendships had grown kind of stale or even bitter some times. Not enough to cause resentment but enough to make us want to strike out and find new people ya know? So we joined a night of games online on discord with a good friend Ash. She's a pretty great artist with a lot of wholesome members on her discord so we figured it was a good place to meet people. 

We were right.

It was a great night we had tons of fun and I laughed harder than I had laughed in a long time playing jackbox games or scribble. We met quite a few really nice people that night. People who became pretty good friends so far. It's also where I met HER. Not that I think anyone will read this really but she will be referred to as M. Our connection was instantaneous, we fell in like old friends. We started hanging out on a daily basis some times ALL day. Learning more and more things we had in common. Simple almost silly things you take for granted in your own personality that stand out like a flashing light in the dark when you see it in someone else. 

Our mutual love of Matchbox twenty, retro games, bad horror movies, randomly singing bad songs by  90s bands like creed out loud there's a thousand examples. She very much seems like my counterpart, it's scary how similar we are. Our catchphrase may as well be ""stop copying me"" We've quickly become very close friends. 

In all the good ways we're similar we're also similar in our negative ways. We're both damaged. Me with mental health and her with mental and physical. 

If it's not clear at this point, I ended up catching feelings. Which isn't a thing that happens to me. I spent quite a few years just not caring about relationships or being with someone. I had a very destructive like, nuclear tier explosion of a breakup and it just kind of made me cold to that side of my feelings. Then there's this girl, M, Who just kind of walked into my life like she had a key. I felt warm for the first time in a long time. 

It doesn't help that I think she's gorgeous. She doesn't think she is which makes me think it more. Not that something like that matters when it comes to how you feel about someone.  

I kind of hate it not going to lie, having these feelings. Because I feel like it was simpler before. Feelings like these are difficult to deal with. Especially when it's so early in our relationship. When I cut myself off from feeling this way for anyone for so long. It also doesn't help that she has a preference that I don't align with. Nothing as cut and dry as sexuality or gender. Though she has said before it's a superficial thing and she could love anyone.   

The hard part is I can never tell really how she feels about me. She's hot then she's cold it flips. When it's just the two of us in DM or in a call she's sweet and loving. When we're with the group it's business as usual we teasingly jab each other and ""talk shit"". The private stuff gives me the impression that she's into me too. Then when I try to move forward, to try and I don't know ""make it a thing"" she pulls back. Shuts herself off from it and me kind of. I don't take it personally, she also had a bad breakup. 

Some times it's just hard to deal with what I could only tell are unrequited feelings. Until the other day..

I don't remember how we got on the topic but things got real. We had a deep conversation about our feelings. Really deep. I laid it all out there. Here is when things get confusing. She tells me that she isn't interested in me like that, that she can't reciprocate romantic feelings.

&#x200B;

Which would have sucked but been entirely fine but then;

As we're ending the real talk she tells me not to run with it, and not to obsess or overthink it which I am prone to do and she knows it but that she does like me too. In a romantic way. It's just not something she could ever act on.

Put yourself in my shoes. The girl you feel yourself falling for, who you spent over two months with every day all day and nearly 2 hours in this deep conversation with where she explains she can't reciprocate, does reciprocate but can't act on it? I'm just stuck with this information and it just spins around in my head. Is she messing with me? Was this all a game? Does she mean it? Why can't she act on it? Did she just do it to in some unintentionally unhealthy way spare my feelings or make me feel better? Or is it real? I don't know  where to go from here I guess time will tell."
"So yesterday was a pretty good day for me emotionally. I don’t actually remember what I did before 6pm. Whatever it was, I was able to keep myself distracted at home just chilling. Although I didn’t wake up until like 2pm.. I got tasked with making a card for my mother (someone else’s wedding card). Not something I do or particularly enjoy, but definitely kept me distracted for a bit. Then my dad randomly dropped by, probably just to keep me company for a bit. Then I got to my favourite show atm drag race UK. 

Today was eh not so good. Started with my Nan bringing lunch over and staying for a bit. But after that, there was really nothing to do. I can only look at my phone for so long each day. Was feeling kind of hopeless again. I’m unemployed, have no hobbies, and no idea what I’m doing in the future. Now I’m no longer with my boyfriend, moving to the other side of the world scares me again. Not knowing anyone, and not having a support network to help me is just plain scary. I would be ok if it wasn’t for Covid though. Currently you cannot leave the country unless you have a crazy good reason (for me it will be a job). So that means I cannot move with my mum or friends helping me. If I hate it there, no one can visit me, I cannot get home for months. When do the restrictions ease? September at the earliest. So do I wait till September? If I do, that means Covid would have ruined my plans for well over a year. I hate waiting. It’s already cost me my relationship and now it’s threatening my career. I don’t know when to start looking into moving again."
"I apologize for any typo(s) I missed...




  At the moment, I'm walking down the sidewalk. It's 12:00 a.m. one minute ago I was just in the car with a friend. We are out making one last run for the night. Myself, I'm extremely observant. Even when I'm high as shit on anything, I see majority of what other people don't see. It is a blessing, and a curse. Robin is driving. Even when he is sober, I don't feel he should be allowed a driver's license. He cannot keep anything straight in his mind, especially high on crack. For the past week I've been staying with him, trying to detox. Obviously that's not working too great. The last four days straight we've gone out and gotten high.
Now Im not one that should be talking, or judging. That being said, living this lifestyle, you see some very ugly sides of people. For example, every time Robin does a shot of “heroin”, he blacks out, stumbles around his apartment, breathing like a fucking dragon and yelling foxhole prayers... Again, I am in no position to complain seeing as I have personally put myself in the position of having to stay with him. It is just another perspective as to how sick we really are as addicts. It is a mental psychosis that takes control of our everyday life. Being someone who is emotional and sentimental, it is a horrible combination to have to live with. People, places, and things move in and out of our lives all the time. Whether we want them to be in our lives or whether or not they stay in our lives, is out of our control. I'm just along for the ride.
Something I've noticed after being around drugs and their culture, is that everyone reacts differently to each substance. One person might take an opiate and become tranquilized essentially... Another person might take the exact same dose, and get a huge rush in energy... Not exactly sure why that happens, but I'm sure it has alot of factors.
As for myself, the substances I usually partake in, are ones I can, for the most part, “control” myself on. I don't like to be impaired physically, or mentally to the point of not being accutely aware. I like to be alert, ready to take action if needed. I always try to give myself the best advantage over a situation... Which is hilariously ironic because as I write this, I realize how my drug use has done nothing but harm to my life in every way possible.
    It's now 5 o'clock in the morning. I've spent the last 3 hours on the couch in the living room, smoking and shooting crack, watching garbage late night TV shows. I did read the book of Judges in the bible for a while. I do enjoy interpreting the stories of the bible at times. Everything I read it I seem to get something new from it. But that knowledge is nothing without using it to take action on life. Action is what differentiates knowledge and wisdom. You must take action with that knowledge and in turn your become wise??? Sounds good though doesn't it?
  As of this moment I have about 48 hours to detox my body enough to be able to do physical labor on Monday with Steve. Hopefully that's still the plan. I'll have to call him later today to confirm. I believe whatever opiates I've been procuring have been weaker than what I usually take. My digestive system seems to be somewhat regulated. I've been retaining water which is a good thing. Fentanyl and heroin push the water from the small intestine, causing constipation and dehydration. I've been eating alot and having bowel movements more than I usually do when I'm using. Although I'm sure the coke is speeding up my metabolism... Oh, human physiology and psychology are so interesting.
 At this point, I'm starting to feel tired. Hopefully I can get a decent amount of sleep... All me how life is when I wake up.…"
"Another day. I got up early today (for me) 10am. I got ready and ate lunch. My friend picked me up at 12:30pm and we went to the beach. I got home again about 3:30pm, had a shower, took a nap till 5pm. Started to get ready again for dinner at 6:30 with my friends. We got home about 9:30pm. It’s 10:30pm now. I spent all day entertained but now I’m on my own, I’m lonely again. I miss him again. It’s shit, I haven’t been alone all day and now I can’t even cope for an hour by myself? I can’t have someone baby sitting me all day everyday, I need to be alone. I have absolutely no idea how I’m going to cope with that."
"Even in physical form my actions unknowingly to please those most contented slave masters. Who seem to sit on top for nothing else other then their taller physical height. I wondered about the cruel distress knowing in the form I am and past beliefs of mine, would bolster those same cruel opressors.

Everywhere we look in society, there are mirrors, one thing we can agree with pinhead is that these are the only interest. Know anyway we didnt have a choice on our sucess, our destiny. Those who call themselves masters have everything on their side

A tired carousel society with inbuilt disadvantages for those with smaller height. We are also in the form we take, and thusly with the opinions concluding from that. Forever reinforcing these masters shit attitudes, prejudices unknowingly

I'm sorry for my whole kind but especially the ones here who are known in male form. That isn't the winning team for us on this world. If it was ever right that there should be ""winning sides"" anyway I wanted to speak on the affliction of our form. The vicious cycle it unknowingly perpetuates it affirms their attitudes towards us. 

Sign off right now for the next time I sexually want to be active knowing this was their idea of fun. Did I ever give consent to it?"
"Only now came to me, fight I don't want. Obstacles people created for me time and again in my life. Finding out the more of our kind the secrecy, lies brutal nature. How many victims did not make it to see it through and reach this same enlightenment. 

For today for briefest moment we really see for a moment. And have to work here to annoint the occasion. This is a big part of them. As I've been saying when I had the purity of thought/ clarity. My life has been too much skewed in their favors. Every thing that we as a kind hold as important.

With no recourse but to wait until moment my hands are no longer tied. Only then does it gain any interest, until that point think of me as a lobotimite walking through fairground. Completely stunted, pacified to the stimuli that everybody else is a part of. Anyway I know my mind is sanctified, but they are not one to act with the integrity. Shooting backwards you see how easy they cut out my life

So to wrap it up this is only here to remind me of the occasion. First interesting thing/ revelation to discover. But in discovering the butting of heads and the inevitable entanglement. So in this forced recluse, passive state. Nothing now but to wait for my hands untied to really be free as intended state"

"I have been working with a therapist to figure out the whole favourite person vs poly crushes thing. I don't think I'm polyamorous, I think the ""crushes"" that I experienced on my friends in the past were all EXTREME favourite person obsessions. I feel so bad for being such an obsessive person - even if I don't necessarily bother my friends.

The more we get to the root of the FP obsessions, the easier it becomes to control. I just need to tell the truth to my poly friends now."
"So, my brother and sister finally got an apartment. The day before yesterday was move in day. My mom was helping them move in, and I decided to come along. When my mom was taking the stuff out of the car she saw something that she specifically told my dad not to put in the car. That put her in a really bad mood. 

When we got home my dad came into my room and asked me why my mom is mad, I told him it’s because he put something in the car that she said not to put. He then said “Oh. Ok. I see.” and went to my moms room. They talked, and when they were done talking my dad came into my room once again and said, “I’m sorry I didn’t remember mom telling me not to put it in the car.”

Cut to yesterday while my mom and I are talking, and she says that my dad did in fact remember that she told him not to put it in the car.

So he lied directly to my face.

I want to confront him so badly but I won’t, because I don’t want to start another problem.

Also, I’m going to have a meeting with all of my teachers. I’m scared/nervous because I don’t know if they’ll even believe me if I say that I have depression and idk what kind of questions they’re going to ask."
"i woke up to my online class i was planning on solving a problem in my math class for the grade but my teacher ended the class before we took any and after that in my physics class i read some paragraphs and solved a problem so my full participation mark is probably guaranteed if i keep this up and i also worked out vacuumed my room it looks so clean now yesterday i just cleaned it now it feels good to look at and i studied for my SAT exam good today and now i can finally say that i feel satisfied and good this diary of self improvement might be the best thing that i ever did

tomorrow's goals:

•study for my SAT exam (18 days left)

•take a shower

•exercise

•sleep 8 hours 

•eat healthy 

my goals seem a little short tomorrow so I'm gonna add 

•go for a run because I'm feeling good"
"About the French girl who spoke my language. 

Note to self:

1. Don't respond immediately if the other side is enraged. They cannot think straight.
2. Response to anger in flirtation should not be a logical explanation as the anger is not real. Explaining yourself kills the vibe. Flirtation or romance is not a logical discussion."
"""The day began with energy and warmness even though it was January. The weather is cold but the excitement in me to meet old friends kept me warm. We promised eachother to meet in the afternoon, to remember the days and to look for the future, to ask how everyone is doing and to ask if everything is all right.

The day continued slowly and I kept waiting for our meeting to come, remembering a certain person among us who I want to see. The hours moved slowly during the morning, it was a workday, and at noon I returned home to eat and to begin preparing for our meeting.

It is afternoon, and I drove my car to the place where we decided to meet, a place we used to visit in the past. But I don't like crowded areas, so I parked my car far and decided to walk to the place. To my right as I walk was a park filled with people. Children playing, parents chatting, and birds singing. Loud and happy, they were having their time. They were smiling and laughing, and I was trying to meet a person in my heart again. Why am I not smiling and laughing, am I truly happy like them? How could this park be so happy and I'm here burning inside to despite knowing that I'll be happy again?

I reached the place of the meeting. I was among the first to arrive. Little by little people came, and once again I saw that person who I want to see. The years has changed many things but I can tell that our hearts didn't change. Our voices denied what we feel. Little by little the time went by, pretending happiness to meet everyone again yet I know I'm not truly happy. I see the person and he sees me back. I can hear his eyes but I don't know how to respond. We stayed a little after sunset and people began to leave one by one. It was very early, I thought we would stay longer but it was a workday, everyone wanted to sleep. I was among the last to leave. The air was heavy in my chest, I didn't want to leave him but I didn't want to overstay my welcome, and I didn't want to give all my attention to one person. The others deserved some too, and so I left alone to my car.

On my way back, the park now on my left, I decided to stay a little. Our meeting ended earlier after all. I sat on a bench. The park now has less people, less noise, the birds are silent, and I'm silent. I began to burn inside in this cold night, this time not from happiness or excitement, but from the anguish in my heart. My dreams, my hopes for this day, the day we meet again didn't go as I planned. It ended like how it began. And now I'm setting alone in the cold night with no one to speak. The bench is spacious when there is only a person setting on it, how I wish he was here next to me. 

I saw then beyond the fence of the park a group of children each with his own personality just like me and the people I just meet in our days. I couldn't hear what they were saying. Some were talking to others, others were walking silently, some moved faster, some slower. When I saw them I felt a bittersweet feeling in me. It's hard to describe but this sight made me realise that the past didn't die and the future has many things to offer. I stood up and returned to my car hoping that one day, maybe one day I'll meet him again and the feelings will be told.""

Why did I write this? I don't know, and it is probably not coherent or meaningful in any way. It means a lot to me to write my feelings and to throw them away. This is a new account that I dedicate to these kinds of posts. The ones that a sane person wouldn't make."
"Real

My alarm goes off at 6:00 a.m. ignore it let it keep going every 5 minutes. I still feel the effects of everything I did last night. Or 7:00 a.m. alarm goes off, and somewhat force myself to wake up. I open my box paraphernalia, and proceed to rig up my last cap. I tie off, find a nice vein, which is hard seeing as my blood pressure is pretty low when I first wake up, hit it and enjoy the euphoria until I fall asleep again. I wake up at 8:20 and realized I got to get my ass going or I'll be late to open the shop. I take a couple gabapentin right before I leave, and start making my way to the shop. On my way I wonder how my boss would react if he were to actually get to the shop before me for a once, realize that some days I don't make it there until 9:05. But the chances of that ever happening are slim to none. I get to the shop, and preform my usual opening process: slide open the bay doors, turn the air compressor on, and set my backpack in the storage room. on my way here I realized today was a bit warm for pants, so I grab an old pair of jeans I had stashed under my toolbox and turn them into shorts. As I'm changing, I realize I left a syringe of what I believe to be Crack from last night, in my back pocket. I grab a random charging cord that is lying around, tie off, and find a vein. Now I finally feel ready for work.
	My work day goes by like a blur. In reality I tune everything else out, I just focus on my work. In a way it's like meditation for me. Occasionally my boss will chime in, and break me out of my trance, but I do his bidding and try to re-enter my meditative state. I get a message from someone on a Reddit, that read yesterday's post. As we start talking I come to find out that we lived in the same area for a little while. I get another message from reddit, but this time it looks like it's an automated one generated by someone showing “concern” for my well-being. It's nice to know that people out there do actually care. And I know there are people out there that do care. When you're in the lifestyle like this, and it's a situation that essentially you created yourself, you can get into this mindset that everything that exists is fucked.
	One of our usual customers stops by, and asks me if I know anything about balancing tires. Of course, being a mechanic, I do know about balancing tires. He says as he drives down the road he can feel a wobble coming from his rear end. At that point my boss walks out, says hello to the customer, says we can take care of it for $20. Then the customer asks if she should pull it up closer, to make it easier for me. My boss says “give him the keys, he can do it. Let's go hang out in the office."" No I truly feel like a slave. At this point I start thinking more about how I can become my own boss. I enjoy writing sharing my thoughts. I love to write a novel, fiction, come up with some great on average story of some magical land or something...
	After work and make my way home, but stop at a friend's house on the way. He called me earlier because he used to work for the same guy I do, and needed a part replaced that he bought through my boss's company. We talk, I see an opportunity when I spot an old catalytic converter sitting in the corner. Maybe I can make a few dollars. He smokes me up and I continue my journey home.	On my way home I realized I'm in a part of town I haven't walked home from you. I crossed the train tracks, looking both ways like my mom taught me back in the day, and continue on my way. Hispanic sit outside on my porches, running around business seems to appear. I hear the birds chirping, and I realize at this moment the life not so bad. Still I crave my drug. Feeling pretty stoned as I make it back to Dixie. The sun's starting to set, things seem to be starting to slow down. People making their way to the bar. I want a guy walking and just hold a mask to his face. kind of funny how the world is taking this whole coronavirus deal. Older man walking past me says what's up I hold his fingers to his lips as if to ask for a cigarette. Cars rushing by on their way home. After a Long Day's work, don't we all just want to f****** get home? Gas stations popping right now. I realized I can't completely control my body when I'm stoned and Hunt anything, as I shuffle my feet walking on the sidewalk. Oh how I do that South Florida. Another guy in his own universe walking down Dixie almost collides with me as we both take a step to the left. I keep talking to my phone, thinking that everything I'm saying is being recorded. Then I realized as I look down that all of the noise from the car's passing me on dixie, as resulted in a bunch of weird gibberish being displayed. I thinking that I'm getting hungry, I have $52 but really need a fix to get through the night and tomorrow. I Sprint across the street, cars rushing toward me, because I've decided to go to Publix. I put on my mask as I'm about to walk into the store. I walk out with raisin brand in a gallon of 2%. Once I get outside I stopped to put the bags in my backpack and realize how heavy it is. It's been a minute since I've actually done something for my life, for myself actually.
I get home, and take a little nap after watching some netflix. I look at my phone and realize that none of my dealers have called me to say they are swinging through to drop off my fix for tomorrow. So I make sure some money is going to be awake, I put my shoes on and walk back to the shop, hoping there's a car there with some gas able to get me to where I have to go. This is the life I've chose. These are the things instead of Atticus to go through everyday just to get by. And to think if I didn't have this horrible affliction, I could have set my phone back down and went straight back to bed."
"My uncle's going to be admitted to the hospital for a while, it seems. For now, it's not severe, but if he doesn't continue getting treatment immediately, it'll deteriorate into something worse. Well, I can't say with confidence because, you know, I'm not his doctor.

It's not COVID, thankfully, yet it's something much worse. He's got bacteria in his blood, which is absolutely not good. For those of you who don't know, human blood--any mammalian blood, really--should be a sterile sight. Meaning, there should be no bacteria in it whatsoever. If you find bacteria in a patient's blood, that's a ticket to the ER for an immediate evaluation and antibiotic treatment. 

I used to work in a microbiology lab doing research when I was in my undergrad days. In fact, it was my first actual lab in research. I don't think the general public really appreciates just how deadly bacterial infections can be if left untreated. Most people back in the day used to die, especially children, from untreated infections. Thanks to modern medicine, that's no longer a huge problem, or, at least, not as much as it was back then.

My uncle's a pretty old guy, but otherwise generally healthy. You know, besides the issue I listed. They're saying his heart's valves are leaky, but they need a full evaluation from either a cardiologist or cardio surgeon. Basically, it means that his valves or one of his valves in his heart, isn't doing their job. I don't want to get into the pathophysiology behind it, but if it's left untreated it's going to get worse.

Apparently, if you can believe it, this was all caused from his tooth. Yeah, really. One of his teeth lost its filling and bacteria started to grow into it. Over time, this grew further and further and eventually went into his bloodstream, where the bacteria made it to his heart and started damaging its valves. It sounds bizarre even when I write this down, but I have heard of stuff like this happening. But, yeah, I just didn't think it would happen to someone in my family.

I hope he'll be okay. I don't think the guy can take open-heart surgery. I don't know. It'll be up the his doctors to decide on what they'll do next. The antibiotics may get rid of the infection, but it's not going to repair the damage done to the valves. At least, I don't believe it will. The valves are not made of cardiac muscle like the rest of the heart, so I doubt it'll heal well with medical intervention.

I haven't been feeling well myself this week, and to be honest, I've been in an awful mood. After hearing this news tonight about my uncle, I'm about to smash my head against the wall."
"Sitting here, with multiple people around me, and I still feel like a ghost. I make small talk with a guy on the bench across from me. Talking about the halfway life. Because of my current run, I barely look like myself. I've lost so much weight, people I know don't even recognize me. Casey and a guy stand behind the broken golf cart, playing with a puppy. 
An older man and a kid skit and talk about the work they've been doing the last few days. Little, meaningless small talk.
It's a Kratom and kava bar. Everyone here constantly drink tea. At this point most of them need it. They're physically activated to it. Without it, they'll go into withdrawals. Cold sweats, chills, restless legs, insomnia... Like having the flu, with an extra helping of anxiety.
Slowly, one by one, everyone makes they're way out of the courtyard. It's peaceful for a Saturday night. Usually, this place is packed to capacity. Music blasting loud enough to be heard the next town over. Shenanigans being had left and right. But tonight, it seems like everyone is exhausted from a long week. Myself included.
The cocaine is the only thing keeping me functional at this point. A small shot before making my way over here, and it just now starts to come down to a point of being tolerable. It keeps my mind off the fact my body constantly screams from opiates.
Pepper start trickling back in to the courtyard where I'm sitting. We all start back up with the small talk, just passing time.
I've always held a negative bias toward this place. But the more time I spend here, I slowly have been warming up to being here. There's a good community of people here. I started to realize it's great to have people around to talk to you. Even if you just met them.
A conversation of hallucinogens somehow comes about. An older man looks like a native American, starts talking about mushrooms and San Pedro. It's something that I've been thinking about doing again myself lately. My past experiences with it has always helped my perspective on the world and reality. Maybe this is something in the near future I'll be able to do again.
Start making my way home. Like worth pretty quiet on this Saturday evening. The sky is partly cloudy, and I can see some of the stars shining pretty bright, even with the street lights on. The crickets are chirping loudly as I make my way home.
Start making my plans for when I get home. Do I do another shot of crack? It does help me stay away from doing all of the Caps I have. I know this is something that I will not be able to maintain forever. No matter how many times I try to control my drug use, it always gets the best of me.
I have an extreme toothache, but they usually comes from the cocaine use. if I had a gas head over activate, and overstimulates the nerves. When I get home I'll take and I'll leave, and maybe that will help take the edge off.
Since I've been walking everywhere lately, gives me a lot more time to think. Not to mention I get my exercising. It's also helped me learn to navigate this part of Lake Worth. Helps to keep my mind off of same routine b******* that floats around.
Is a contemplate my work day, I realized how less tense things were with Joe being gone. The amount of stress that he carries so heavy, then it seems to just leak over to me, and cause me to be stressed out.
I pass a few kids sitting on the corner, building a small fire with kindling and dry leaves they found on the street. It reminds me of how I used to be as a kid. To hang out with a small group of friends, pass the time, talk about the future of who we want to be or what we want to do. Just the thought of this makes me realize that I still constantly think about that. What do I want to be? What do I want to do with my life? What is going to be the next step of progress for me? And honestly, the big question, how am I going to get through the detox of these chemicals I use on a daily basis?
The good thing about the drugs I take, is the detox will not kill me. It is possible to get through them on my own. To have the discipline and the will to actually stop taking them, enter the pain in the anxiety that comes with the stopping of taking the drugs. As an addict whatever we desire, whatever we want, we want it now. Actually I want it yesterday. But that's not the way reality works it's not the way to human body works. Things take time. It took an amount of time for my body to build a tolerance to the chemicals that I use. The thing about it is the chemicals help you to not pay attention about how much time is passed. It says there you can travel through time at a different rate. But really it just changes your focus, changes your priorities, your necessities, what's important to you in life."
"These new scientists we've got are brilliant! There's a machine we operate for one of our procedures, and it took me about two weeks to understand it and roughly a month over to master it. But, one of these guys, who also happens to be an engineer? It's too easy for him. He mastered it within a day! He humbled me by saying he had a ""great teacher"". I don't deserve the compliment.

I never considered myself a teacher, though not as a profession anyway. As for the other scientist, she's much more bubbly and attentive than me. I'm happy for these two here. Once I leave, they'll be able to overtake my position much more easily. In other words, it'll be smoother to pass the torch onto them.

Huh. You know, I haven't really thought of what I'm going to say to my boss eventually. I'd imagine he'll be upset, but rather sad than angry. Still, it's my career that I need to develop. Were the pay and workload not so awful, I'd have stayed for maybe another year or two. As it stands, however, I have no intention anymore.

The Doctor has been out for a while. She hasn't shown up to the lab this entire week. She had a nasty reaction to the first dose of the vaccine, and now she needs to be cleared by the medical staff before she's given the greenlight to come back. I understand the need for precaution, though she's been telling me that she's been banging her head onto the wall in frustration. I don't envy the life of a postdoc fellow.

Speaking of banging heads, the Professor's been doing the same but to others. Yeah, he's still in a crappy mood, and today he was going through more and more of his demanding grant process, asking for more and more data. Ugh...I'm getting tired of this lab, honestly.

Oh, I'm sure industry will be no different, though working in an industrial setting will be more demanding than academia. At least, that's what I thought, but now that I've gotten a taste of both worlds, I can honestly say it really depends on where you work and with whom you work. Of course, the pay's much better, at least for someone like me.

I have to go to work tomorrow, speaking of which. I got the Saturday shift again, so I don't have a choice. It'll be a short day of work, but it's still a pain to commute. Traffic is virtually non-existent at the moment, but next Monday will likely be busier. Apparently, the Governor is planning on easing restrictions on restaurant dining times. I don't think there's going to be throngs of people going out, but we'll see what happens.

I went to see my primary care doctor yesterday. He was cool, a young resident, and a very attentive and energetic guy. Honestly, I prefer the residents than the senior physicians most of the times. The seniors obviously have much more medical/scientific prowess, but they can be extremely curt sometimes, and they tend to get annoyed if a patient wants to speak longer with them. That's totally anecdotal on my part, but there you go.

Anyway, he was cool and told me to keep taking care of myself, citing no major medical issues. He did give something for my constant GERD, a class of drug called a PPI (protein pump inhibitor). Long story short, it causes the stomach to produce less acid, which lessens the severity of heartburn. I have to take it for four weeks and then come back to see him within six weeks. Easy.

That's all I got for now. Goodnight."
"Why does this always happen with me.
They say it's god's plan. Hearing this since last 20 yrs.
Why the hell is god's plan against me.

Is too much to desire love from someone. What is wrong with me that no one ever fell for me.
My introspection said that i didn't try hard enough.

But this time i tried. Not only once but thrice. But why am I taking 90% efforts. Or is the guy expected to take more efforts?
If yes, till when? Why do I only get replies but not a msg!

This was the last chance i gave myself in the hope that maybe this is why it didn't workout with others.

Not even sure if I would ever fall in love. Feels like a curse."
" What is all this shit I am thinking about? Conspiracy theories. Like this girl plotted something to get me away from the girl I wanted. Dude. You did it yourself. You are responsible. She might be a bitch. But you are a bitch as well if you don't take responsibility. I was in a bad or undeveloped state of mind. You deserved that. Nobody is going to be ""kind "" to you. Why should they be? They are fighting for their existence and you are fighting for yours. YeaH..BuT Im AlwAyS KiNd... Fuck that. You do that because it suits your needs. It is just that. Don't expect anything. Either you do things within your control or you watch your life swayed with the need of everyone around you. Take fucking control of your life.

I have already done that. Just getting it out of my head. That's all. Thoughts and memories and current situation. It is normal . It is okay to feel those things sometimes. Just remember the difference between thoughts and reality. They are very different. Don't take shit from no one. Have a grand vision and muster up the willingness to do something about it everyday. Be thankful for what you have. Be grateful. You can write a lot what other people did to you that you feel was unjustified. What does that do for you other than feel sorry for yourself? Nothing other than making you feel like a bitch. Take control you motherfucker. Your drunken thoughts are not reality. It does not change anything outside you. People don't just realize that you are an awesome because you had a six pack. Just enjoy the new year. You are doing great and you are on the right path. You are enough and don't need wisdom from people. There is a whole world of literature from all the great personalities in the world and you are stuck with these weak ass pussies and their opinions. Fuck that. Trust me. You will be ok and more. I think you are an awesome dude... Just ride these emotions out. They seem a bit too strong right now...But does not make them your ultimate reality. The mistakes you are thinking of seems unforgivable right now because you are focused on the outcome. You are thinking things through and you are forgetting the situation behind your past action. You are only thinking about your stupid actions. That is not the whole reality and you are not in a state to understand it well. So don't give too much importance to these thoughts because you cannot think clearly right now. Enjoy your drink. Ciao"
"The year is over. Learnt many things. 

Feels like I am not the same person I was in 2019. In fact, I don't even remember what type of person I was back then.

When someone from my family got covid, every night I used to think that maybe next morning he wont be anymore. 

Sleeping about thinking this for 2 weeks eventually made me accept that it is what it is. Luckily, he is fine now.

Fear of regret or Regret of fear? Idk. Maybe both.

If i remove all outer layers of my personality, I am just a sad person, who never had any real friends, a loser who only knows how to give good advice to others and most importantly, a coward. I am a coward. 

No one ever fell in love with me. Or even remotely considered dating me. Not that I look bad, mostly it is my religion which hampers my chances.

I keep myself busy with work, workout regularly but deep down i want someone to like me.

I have reached that stage, where I fell for a girl even without talking to her. She just seems to be perfect. I get those vibes from her. But I never spoke to her and I hate myself that i dont have the guts to talk to her."
"Part Two

 The very first memory I can recall is the room my crib was in.

I honestly do not know how old I was, if I was still in the crib, back in those years, kids would sleep in cribs till they could not fit anymore. My crib would have a special feature though, the feet side would fall out and would then give a leg room for more grown up kids to sleep in the crib. Up till now, I do not need much space in my bed to feel comfortable, I do not move much at night and usually wake up in the same position I went to sleep. I assume it is the imprint left on my brain from little to no room in the crib.

Back to the nursery, if you can even call that. I remember the, of course, crib and a green chair with wooden legs and armrests. I remember there was wallpaper, but cannot recall the design. I remember the wallpaper, I would pick the walls with my little fingers stuck through the crib bars. 

I remember a desk. I am not sure why a nursery would have a desk. Back where I am from in the 80's they did not use disposable diapers or changing tables. So my assumption, it was something that was not needed to be anywhere else in the condo.

I remember my mother's second husband. I wish I did not remember him... He was an abusive piece of... work. He would only beat me up and put me in time outs when my mom was at work. 

I assume by then I was around four or five years old. Because now I can recollect the whole setting of the living room, the kitchen, the master bedroom and so on.

We lived in a building that was built in 1918. The section we lived was an add-on in later years and it did not have bathrooms, only one toilet room. Literally it was a tiny space with a toilet, couple of shelves and a door. 

Me and my mother lived on the third floor, my paternal grandparents on the second floor, we shared floor/ceiling and on the other side of the second floor lived my nanny. I will write about my nanny in my next blog, she deserves a book to be honest.

Back to the second husband... Like I mentioned before, I had a lot of health problems as a kid and one of the issue I had was otitis and enlarged adenoid. Which is causing your nose not to function properly and terrible ear aches, without having ear infection. So for some time until I was six, when they finally cut the adenoid out, I was a mouth breather. Apparently that would upset my step ""dad"" and he would beat me telling me to stop mouth breathing (I couldn't really help it) and also do not sit so close to the TV. Later on my mother figured out I also had a bad eye sight.

So after the beatings would not help to stop my mouth breathing, he would put me in timeouts. However, one time from my nanny's words, I was crying so hard that it forced her to come upstairs and rescue me from that horrible person. She was a quiet a large woman, so she basically threatened his life if he ever touches a hair on my head...(that woman cussed A LOT), he never did, thank god! She grabbed me like a potato sack and carried me away to her condo and kept me there till my mom was back from work. I do not remember what happened next....but at some very short point I did not see him anymore. He just disappeared from our lives. It was my mom and I against the world again. My sister still lived with my grandparents and would visit to live with us during all of the school breaks, being older than me she was already in elementary school by the time all of this abusive stuff was happening. 

After the second husband disappearance, I lived a pretty happy life, considering all of the doctors and health issues, I was pretty happy girl. I remember going to see my biological father on the weekends, although I clearly remember I did not enjoy the visitations and hated his wife.

So...here was my first memory."
"So, I had a new therapist but I decided I don’t like her approach. I had about 6 sessions with her, and on the fourth session I told her about that incident that happened between me and my sister. She asked me if I could just “Let it go”(no joke) I told her no. At the time I didn’t understand why I didn’t want to let it go, but now I do. It’s because I feel like I want to be mad at her, but she’s doing exactly what I wanted her to do, she’s getting therapy. 

In another session I had with her I told her about what happened five years ago, when my dad accused my mom of cheating. Again, she asked me if I could just let it go. It’s like she thought none of it was affecting me, when I literally told her it was.

Anyway, I had a meeting with my school counselor and I told her I have depression. She then told my mom about section 504. It basically gives me an extra day to complete homework because I have a mental illness. The thing is, that isn’t going to be enough.

Giving me an extra day to complete work isn’t going to help my depression. I need my environment to change. I need my parents to be actual parents. Lately my mom has been working 24/7, so she isn’t able to cook dinner. And my dad  doesn’t really know how to cook the meals I like, so he resorts to asking me if I want fast food (which I obviously don’t want bc I don’t want to be morbidly obese by the time I’m 17.) I then have to cook my own dinner. It isn’t even “real” cooking, It’s usually frozen food. It’s so tiring because I don’t think other 14 year olds have to cook their own dinner so often. I basically have to do it every other day, which means I sometimes have to eat the same food I ate the other day which gets boring.

I’m worried I’m going to get into some sort of trouble for not doing my homework because section 504 is supposed to help me, but it isn’t as easy as just giving me an extra day."
"I got work tomorrow, like many others. Yeah, Monday and the doom and gloom that it brings. Frankly, I actually don't hate Mondays. For us at the lab, Tuesdays and Fridays tend to be the worst for us. I don't know why Tuesdays exactly, but Friday is when everyone is scrambling to get their work done as quick as possible before the weekend. You know, so that they don't have to pick up all the extra work on the next Monday.

I guess Tuesday is when people come to the realization that the work week has begun anew. Monday hasn't really hit it for them, so they think to themselves, ""Oh, right, it's Tuesday. I still have four more days including this one before the weekend comes.""

I did get a pay raise finally, so that's something to look forward to, but even with that I still don't want to go tomorrow. Hell, who wants to go to work? The only thing so far I've roughly enjoyed from this pandemic is the lessened time for my commute. Even then, there's always going to be traffic. And, I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't point in my previous entry, I still would prefer the snarled traffic as a sign that things will go back to normal again. 

One of my neighbors has been acting strange lately. Him and his wife think there's something in the attic of their house. When I asked what he thought it could be, he said it's probably rats ""or something"". They're a nice couple, though the husband is a little more on the superstitious side. I probably shouldn't be badmouthing him on here--and I'm not! It's just that, you know, hearing people go off on their beliefs can be exhausting, even the ones that aren't *that* outlandish. I told them to buy rodent poison and place it in the attic and see if it'll disappear overnight. Hopefully, that'll calm them down, especially the husband.

An employee at the hospital got into trouble for not wearing his face mask on public transit. What an idiot. Seriously, of all places not to don a mask, you pick *public* transit? I guess what had happened was, someone on the train recorded him not wearing one while he got called out on it. He started getting aggressive towards the person recording him, exchanged heated words with them, and then his employee badge and I.D. were sent to the hospital's admins.

I have no idea what happened to the guy, but to do something as brazen as that, he must've realized it would've only been a matter of time before someone called him out on that. Enjoy your possible write-up and/or unemployment, I guess. Hope it was worth it.

One day at a time, then. Happy Holidays and all that, but it certainly doesn't feel like it. This New Year's Eve is going to be the worst. Thankfully, in the meantime, I've already purchased Christmas presents for my family ahead of time. 

I want to enjoy the small amount of time I got left in this Sunday. Goodnight, and stay safe."
"Reddit diary,

Today I actually managed to meditate! Culadasa's book is a veritable goldmine, and finding it was one of the best things to ever happen in my life. I've been not meditating for months, many months, and hopefully I'll be able to stick to it this time. I never manage to actually stick to anything in my life anyway, but I hope I'll do it. My day wasn't much different from the others except for this, though... and I'm now rolling my eyes at my country's media swooning over Joe hair-sniffing Biden. It's not like he's our president, dammit. Pathetic."
"Wednesday, November 4th, 2020.

Right now the big internal tussle with Eric’s landlord has calmed while we wait. I smoked a bowl and a half with him in the car, right as we got back from getting Advil for this fucking tooth pain.

I got him to sleep, take a nap for a little bit while we “wait” for these people that may not even show up between 9 am to 5 pm. He hadn’t slept for but an hour in the past 24. It’ll put his mind at ease. 

I do love him, but he’s too much. At least right now. Things are confusing and I’d rather not divulge further into that. 

Currently, I’m laying on some weird leather couch that looked like it belonged to a set where grandpa (later grandmas) big leather lazy boy. I don’t have the best connection down here, and no one is really talking / iming back. I wish I had air pods or some earphones but yet again my battery is about a mere quarter if that. I’ll probably have to go get the charger from the car but that’ll wake Eric up, or not, I don’t know if he’s a heavy sleeper or not.

I want to smoke another bowl, and gladly I packed my grinder so perhaps later. I’m glad my tooth pain has stopped, though. Maybe I can get some Uber eats or something later, too. 

I can hear cars outside and I do get a bit paranoid. If they come, we’ll have to call the cops. This thing is a huge mess and we’re trying to help, but it doesn’t help that the landlord is using bogus and illegal intimidation tactics to fuck with him. 

Ah fuck. I just got a call in for a telehealth checking me in for a therapist appointment at 4. I will have to charge my phone. I can’t be high for that. I was last time and it was stupid. I felt stupid. But by the time 4 rolls around, (it’s just now 1:05pm) I should be good. 

This was nice to write. Maybe it’ll help with the loneliness."
"Hortensia

""Some times, ones just gotta eat some sh\*t.""

Isaac’s pearls of wisdom tend to be baroque and unpolished, but poignant nonetheless. We talked on the phone yesterday while I was at the roof garden of Angélique's building, crushing berries of a nondescript bush between my fingers, letting them drop into the garden of the convent next door, where the nuns were tending happily to their plants, unaware of the girl watching from above.

""Dude, I cried last night,"" Isaac said, ""I couldn't take it any more and I cried. I expected that I would have to start all over again. I know sometimes ones just gotta eat some sh\*t. But it's been harsh Aggie.""

Isaac and I have been a reflection of each other, following parallel lives since we were twelve and creepy teachers unsuccessfully pursued us while our overworked mothers left us in school for far too long after classes were over. We both have a knack for writing, for art and chaos. But Isaac has always been a level above me. He is smarter, he is wilder, more talented and more assertive in his self-destruction and his creation of beautiful things. Yet life keeps throwing curveballs, and his beautiful projects keep going to waste, so he cried.

It so happens that I had cried the night before as well, unravelling in a spectacle of swearing and hyperventilating, also frustrated by this life of unfulfillment that we never saw coming, our cushy childhood giving an arrogant expectation of success that hasn't come.

I felt good then, as I watched the nuns play with their dog during the last rays of sunlight and I listened about how that night's misery was not exclusive to me, about how each of us, copped in our own corner of the city, broke down in anger and frustration, I felt less alone, like it will eventually get better.

We both cried the same night, because sometimes ones just gotta eat some sh\*t.

Yours Truly,

Agatha"
"I haven't been feeling too well lately. My throat feels a bit sore, but I don't feel sick at all. No fever, no nothing. Maybe I'm coming down with something, but I'm certain it isn't the virus. Perhaps it's time I get tested, though I doubt a test will do me much good--just gives me an ounce in sense of security.

I'm hoping it isn't the virus. If I get tested and it comes back positive, by law, I have to go into self-quarantine for 14 days, and then I have to get cleared both by my doctor and my hospital's occupational health department. As far as I know, in addition to all of that, I won't get paid during that fortnight, and even if I do, it'll probably be the first three days. I don't recall my workplace's policy saying if it would count towards my sick days, but that hardly matters. What matters is that me going away for even a day would be suicide for both my paycheck and my lab members.

Which brings me to my next issue: my workload. Until we get another scientist on the team, I've been running around like a headless chicken, doing so many tasks here and there. I'm well-appreciated by everyone in the lab, but I feel exhausted. Not that I'm trying to play the tough guy, because I'm not one, but I don't want to worry any of my labmates, especially during this pandemic. If any of them catch so much as a whiff of me hinting towards illness or some sort of malady--physical or mental--they'll panic and talk to the Professor to have me go into quarantine.

Seriously, any implication that I make in which I state that I'm not feeling well, and I can expect to get shipped off for that 14-day quarantine. 

It's been pretty hard for me. I'm getting more and more and even more work piled up on me. I've already made up my mind that I don't plan to stay for another year, maybe even less than that depending on circumstances. Money's getting tight for me, with this damned pandemic seemingly never ending, it's only going to get worse before it gets better.

I feel both tired and energetic. What's the word to use for that? Well, contradicting would be technically correct.

I hope things get better."
"I never really listen to lyrics when it comes to music. I like to listen to the melody and harmony, the beat and the rhythm. But this song was haunting me. It taunted me. And it tried to warn me. 

“I’ve got you under my skin. 
I’ve you got you deep in the heart of me. 
So deep in my heart you are nearly a part of me. 
I’ve got you under my skin.”

During the late summer I had a dream. I was driving down a street I frequent in my drives around town. In my car...err messy car. Everything looked spot on so it felt like I wasn’t dreaming. I was listening to my music. And I remembered that I had sent her a text asking her on a date. I saw myself send the message and felt how nervous I initially felt about sending the message. This wasn’t a dream. 
I didn’t know what she would reply. All I knew was that I was proud that sent the her the message. I was truly happy and optimistic about everything in my life. 
Hope in a dream? 
And then I felt sheer panic. Did I really send that to her? What did I do? The anxiety woke me up and made me check my phone. The dim light too much for my eyes. Come on. Focus. My screen read some ungodly hour. Good. Nothing sent on any social media. But the fear lingered. It ruined my whole day. Not till I spoke with my friend did I feel better about it. It doesn’t only happen to me? Fair Play! Still though...fuck you, dream. 

“I’ve tried so not to give. 
I said to myself “This affair never can go so well. “
But why should I try to resist when baby I know so well
I’ve got you under my skin.”

It has been over 15 years since I had feelings for someone different than my ex-wife. And I don’t know how to navigate them. Hell, I don’t know if they are real. Perhaps it’s nothing more than infatuation. 
Then not real. 
I thought I had power over them. 
Definitely not real. 
But truth be told they have dominated me. I underestimated how overpowering romantic emotions can be. The same can go for any emotion you try to suppress, I suppose. You just end unleashing a maelstrom. Those same emotions that make you feel great end up tearing you up from the inside. 
So maybe, just maybe real. 
I know she does not feel the way I feel. I wish I didn’t have feelings for someone who doesn’t feel the same way. 

“I’d sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near 
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
That repeats and repeats in my ear,
“Don’t you know little fool, you never can win. 
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.”
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
‘Cause I got you under my skin.”

This weekend has been a rather lonely one for me. I have felt the absence of people in my life. One of those was her. She confessed to having withdrawn herself. In preparation of an upcoming and unwanted event. And I told her I felt her absence. Did she see me when I said that? She didn’t meet my eyes. Rather glad she didn’t. The sadness would have been traitorous to my “playing it cool” vibe. Although I was truly understanding of her predicament. Well we had a lot to drink and at one point I come to and I’m massaging her. Way to go, dumbass. Let me tell you...those were some treacherous waters I was sailing. So at this point it is obvious to me that I can’t fight it. These feeling are true. They’re real. And they’re manifesting in ways I cannot control. The next day I’m toiling over how I feel. 
Little hungover? Perhaps. But I digress. 
I want her happiness over mine. And I still love her. I wish she would choose me. But why would she? She might not know how I feel. I have said anything? She seems to value me as a friend and I her. I want to be her friend. We don’t have the easiest of times making friends. Perhaps I just need to let these feelings go. Accept them but get over it. Move on. It was a restless night that night. And I wished, with every fiber of my being, that she were there. 
That she would comfort me. 
That she chose me. 
That I could hold her. 
In the middle of all these overwhelming thoughts I snap to from a sound coming from in the room. I could feel the heat from the sun coming through my window. That means I didn’t sleep. Again. Someone was getting into bed with me. But I locked the door right? I reached out. I felt the softness her hair. I felt her head in my hands. I finally opened my eyes. Shocked. I saw her golden hair in my hands. My fingers entwined with her radiant locks. She was there. She chose me. And then I woke up. Alone."
"So, my mom is tired of me having missing assignments. She said she's going to sit by me all day until I get it done. She threatened to take away all of my stuff if I don't.

I am going to attempt, for the last time, to tell her that I have depression. I'll try to update this later.

(8:47 AM) Update: So, a lot happened. My dad came into my room asking what I said because my mom woke him up to tell him to move out so I could do my work. She was crying. I told him I said none of those things, and that I'm depressed which is why I'm not doing my work. Then he asked me to please talk to her. 

When I walked into the room she was sobbing, and asking me why I wasn't doing my work, and what I needed from her to do it. I said I need therapy. She asked why, and I told her it's because I'm depressed.

She said I just can't label myself, and asked me to explain my depression. Through tears I asked her if she remembered 7th grade, when I was late everyday and I had a lot of missing assignments.

I already don't really remember a lot of the stuff that was said, but I told her that it's not that simple to just do my work, and she told me that I just need to pull my homework out. She also asked me if I knew what was going to happen if I failed high-school, and told me that I wouldn't be able to get a job. 

But yeah, she said she's going to get me a therapist. So I guess that's good."
" Why do I cry?

Why do I cry whenever I see people doing manual labor, trying to make ends meet in this pandemic?

The other day while on my way to the bank I cried inside when I saw an old man carrying loads of trash bags. Upon closer look, his load was not rubbish at all. Inside them were most probably the tools he uses in fixing shoes. He was most likely desperate to look for money amid this year-long quarantine. While trying to hold my tears back, I realized how lucky I am. At least, I have money to withdraw; I still have my job.

I remember one time while I was riding the jeepney. I shed a few tears because I pitied the driver. I wondered how he’s doing. I wondered if he’d still have money left after paying his daily rent. I was the only passenger he had the whole route.

Earlier, I saw a man selling fruits and vegetables along the road. And, I prayed that he’d sell out all his produce today.

I am crying hard as I write this. I wonder why. I hope my tears can heal the world. 

Really, I have nothing but tears. I wish I were rich enough to help them. I wish I were bold enough to ask if they’re doing fine. But I’m not. I’m selfish like others.

I hope these all end soon."
"Next week, starting Wednesday, will be my work anniversary. I'm working up the nerve to ask my boss for a pay-raise, but it's not going to be easy I'm sure. I did look up some tips and advice on how to handle a pay-raise negotiation, or, in this case, request. Basically, be straightforward, talk about the positives you've brought to the team, and keep it concise and explain why you need a raise. That's pretty much it, and I don't think he's going to be too picky about it.

If he says no, however, I've a plan. I'll be staying between 6 months to a year, and after that, I'm handing in my 2-week notice, whichever comes first within that time period. This team is wonderful and has been treating me well, especially my boss who I owe a great deal of respect for bringing me in. However, the reality is that I'm never going to get anywhere up the ladder in terms of pay and recognition without moving into another job. As much as it sucks, that's really the only way--for me, at least--to move to a better path. 

There's also job networking, certainly, which is why I bring up my next subject. I got a message from a business acquaintance recently, a fellow scientist who's currently working in industry. The company he's joined looks like a startup, though they're growing and seem to be doing well so far ever since they were founded about 5 years ago. He promises me that he can get me a position within their company, and even he says that they'll be willing to pay me ""much more"" than my current position.

Though I know industry pays phenomenally more than academia, I can't just leave my team right now. Besides, I've still other procedures to learn and grow with during this time here so far. Once we get other people on board and I train them enough, I'll be leaving, and that's in lieu of what the results from the pay-raise request will be.

I know there are other factors to consider: commute, new environment, new bosses, new coworkers, more work, more projects, more management, different attitudes, different work culture, etc., etc. I'm familiar with any possible changes, but the truth of the matter is that I don't want to be in an academic lab forever. Honestly, I never wanted to be in this job in the first place, but I had no choice at the time during my nightmarish jobhunting. I absolutely do not want to repeat that, so I want to be sure I'll be ready and have a comfortable position for myself once I leave.

Nothing's written in stone, of course, but preparation is and will always be the key for a higher chance of success. But, God, now that I'm writing all of this down, it's giving me anxiety. One of my coworkers, the Doctor, asked me if I wanted to go into medical school. It was something, at the time, that I had considered seriously when I got of high school, but I don't think I can do it anymore. Rather, it's too expensive and the amount of time and money invested into something like that will not pay off in the end. 

I'm getting ahead of myself, but I know for a fact that, if I were to go for an interview, hypothetically, for one of these biotech companies, one of the first things they're going to ask me is what my future goals or plans are. Well, here it is; here's my plan in writing.

I don't have work tomorrow so I want to enjoy the rest of this relaxing and beautiful Sunday as much as possible. I'll hit up my acquaintance later down the line, and who knows? Maybe there'll be other characters, too.

Have a nice day!"
"I felt alone today, like completely lost in my own head and world. No one to bother me and no one to disturb my journey through my thoughts. I finally realize what they mean when they say being alone isn't the same thing as being lonely. 

One thing I noticed today is also my addiction to social media and my phone, I really should try to break that so that I can experience the world in the present instead of looking at a screen to try and be connected with people who don't even want to connect with me. Of course I shouldn't take this too far and never use/check my phone because if someone wants to reach out to me I should also respect their time and their effort to be a part of my life. 

Work was okay, I am getting more confident in my customer interactions and being able to explain things to people, but at the same time I feel like all that will make me better is more experience. I really wish there was a pill like in the movie limitless (NZT) that I could take and become the perfect version of myself. I know about nootropics and other ""brain drugs"" but if they are real, then why don't more people take them? 

Anyways, I think I want to go and be alone for a while now.

\-Love always,

J."
